the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .

" the markets are asking the question ' which country will be the next to fall ? '
the markets seem to have decided that hungary will be the next iceland .
however , there are other countries that share some unpleasant similarities with iceland , " said a danske bank report .
the baltics make it onto a list of 15 countries danske bank thinks are " in the danger zone " and " at risk of a significant slowdown and increased financial distress " as a result of their large current account deficits , high credit growth in recent years and asset market bubbles , notably in real estate .
" it is not a given that these countries will undergo a similar collapse as iceland , but we think market participants should be very careful in these markets , " danske bank advised .

" the good news is that the imf has ample funds to bail out the ukraine , or indeed any country in the region that comes under funding pressure , " capital economics said .
" the bad news is that even if the worst case scenario is averted , gdp growth in the ' super-deficit ' countries is likely to slow sharply next year .
with the exception of the baltics , outright recession is not yet our central forecast for these countries .
but it is looking more possible by the day . "
the three baltic stock exchanges lost more ground thursday , continuing a bad week on the financial markets .
tough week for baltic exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baltic exchanges have been taking hits all week the nasdaq omx tallinn exchange closed down 2.54 per cent , riga was down 3.82 per cent and the largest of the three baltic exchanges in vilnius dropped even more sharply , down 5.29 per cent .
the baltic benchmark index -lrb- bbi -rrb- which includes data from all three exchanges , closed down 4.50 per cent at 322.13 .
all three exchanges experienced similar falls wednesday , with the decline coming on the back of the downbeat report released by danske bank noting baltic exposure to credit default swap -lrb- cds -rrb- risks .

hundreds of people dressed in black or in traditional dirndl dresses and lederhosen were lining the main square , where the formal part of the ceremony was to take place .
although haider 's anti-foreigner stance and his revisionist statements divided the austrian public , the governor of carinthia was supported by a large part of the population in his home province .
" i have come to bid farewell to the best man carinthia ever had , " said gertrude naber-ehrlich , an elderly lady from klagenfurt .
in a ceremony that seemed fit for a head of state rather than for the deceased governor of carinthia , haider 's coffin was led in a procession around the city center .
the son of libyan leader moamer gaddafi , saif al-islam gaddafi , attended the ceremony .
he befriended haider during his post-graduate studies in vienna .
two presidents of northern italian regions , renzo tondo from friuli-venezia giulia and giancarlo galan from veneto , were also expected to participate .
haider died october 11 at the age of 58 in klagenfurt , when the car he was driving at a speed of 142 kilometers per hour veered off the road and flipped over several times .
haider was drunk at the time of the accident .
contrary to media reports , no european right-wingers , such as jean-marie le pen from france and alessandra mussolini from italy , were present . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

led by the united states and european union members , the security council has imposed three sets of sanctions on teheran .
iran has said its nuclear program serves only to generate electricity . the national trade bans reportedly put in place in germany are intended to focus on products made exclusively by participating countries , making it hard for iran to find replacements from other countries not participating in the expanded un sanctions . earlier this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called attempts at pressuring iran to stop its enrichment program with unilateral sanctions " counterproductive . " moscow maintains that the " politics of adopting unilateral and anti-iranian sanctions espoused by some countries is counterproductive , " the foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 18.10.2008 spain calls for closer eu-georgia ties amid reports of clashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and the eu have good relations but some feel they should be closer spain will push for closer ties between the eu and georgia following the conflict with russia , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said saturday as gunfire is reported between rival groups in georgia . " i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 18.10.2008 spain calls for closer eu-georgia ties amid reports of clashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and the eu have good relations but some feel they should be closer spain will push for closer ties between the eu and georgia following the conflict with russia , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said saturday as gunfire is reported between rival groups in georgia . " i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" deutsche bank does not need capital from the state , " ackermann was quoted as saying saturday the package , rushed through the german parliament on friday and immediately signed into law , comes into effect on monday .
starting on monday , banks can make direct requests for guarantees on loans of less than 36 months from other banks , with the government setting aside 400 billion euros for the purpose .
banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .
accords between the banks and the state are to be established on a case-by-case basis and will only be made public if a bank 's by-laws require it .
otherwise , they will remain confidential , said finance ministry spokesman torsten albig .
banks must accept conditions before aid is agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue is at hand but the banks have to work for it banks must accept certain conditions in return for the aid , with the state being given a say in bank strategy , the use of the funds , remuneration of state organs and dividend policy .
other conditions are to be established during a cabinet meeting early monday or on a case-by-case basis .
the finance ministry would like to set a limit of 500,000 euros on wages for top directors of banks that accept money and ban dividend payments .
the fund will exist until december 31 , 2009 , at which point it is to be liquidated " in the best interest of taxpayers . "
if the state still owns shares in banks , it will sell them at the right time for the best price .
it is only then that the total cost to taxpayers will be known .
the charge is to be shared by federal authorities and individual states on a basis of 65 percent to 35 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of people dressed in black or in traditional dirndl dresses and lederhosen were lining the main square , where the formal part of the ceremony was to take place .
although haider 's anti-foreigner stance and his revisionist statements divided the austrian public , the governor of carinthia was supported by a large part of the population in his home province .
" i have come to bid farewell to the best man carinthia ever had , " said gertrude naber-ehrlich , an elderly lady from klagenfurt .
in a ceremony that seemed fit for a head of state rather than for the deceased governor of carinthia , haider 's coffin was led in a procession around the city center .
the son of libyan leader moamer gaddafi , saif al-islam gaddafi , attended the ceremony .
he befriended haider during his post-graduate studies in vienna .
two presidents of northern italian regions , renzo tondo from friuli-venezia giulia and giancarlo galan from veneto , were also expected to participate .
haider died october 11 at the age of 58 in klagenfurt , when the car he was driving at a speed of 142 kilometers per hour veered off the road and flipped over several times .
haider was drunk at the time of the accident .
contrary to media reports , no european right-wingers , such as jean-marie le pen from france and alessandra mussolini from italy , were present . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 18.10.2008 spain calls for closer eu-georgia ties amid reports of clashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and the eu have good relations but some feel they should be closer spain will push for closer ties between the eu and georgia following the conflict with russia , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said saturday as gunfire is reported between rival groups in georgia . " i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of people dressed in black or in traditional dirndl dresses and lederhosen were lining the main square , where the formal part of the ceremony was to take place .
although haider 's anti-foreigner stance and his revisionist statements divided the austrian public , the governor of carinthia was supported by a large part of the population in his home province .
" i have come to bid farewell to the best man carinthia ever had , " said gertrude naber-ehrlich , an elderly lady from klagenfurt .
in a ceremony that seemed fit for a head of state rather than for the deceased governor of carinthia , haider 's coffin was led in a procession around the city center .
the son of libyan leader moamer gaddafi , saif al-islam gaddafi , attended the ceremony .
he befriended haider during his post-graduate studies in vienna .
two presidents of northern italian regions , renzo tondo from friuli-venezia giulia and giancarlo galan from veneto , were also expected to participate .
haider died october 11 at the age of 58 in klagenfurt , when the car he was driving at a speed of 142 kilometers per hour veered off the road and flipped over several times .

corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "
a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that the credit crisis could affect the real economy have been confirmed in europe , swedish plane maker saab said it would cut 500 jobs over two years after announcing heavy losses .
unemployment has grown across europe with key sectors such as car-makers badly hit as the downturn gathers pace .
the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso head to the us after a visit to canada sarkozy and barroso head to camp david , the presidential retreat in the state of maryland , after meeting canadian prime minister stephen harper in quebec city to launch a process that might eventually lead to an " economic partnership " between canada and the eu .
the meeting was initially supposed to focus on a possible free trade deal between canada and the eu . but the meeting 's new focus was announced by harper as he laid out a six-point economic plan following his re-election this week .
he promised to make sure canadian banks are not put at a disadvantage by rescue efforts in europe and the united states , where governments are pumping money into financial institutions to protect them . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "

hundreds of people dressed in black or in traditional dirndl dresses and lederhosen were lining the main square , where the formal part of the ceremony was to take place .
although haider 's anti-foreigner stance and his revisionist statements divided the austrian public , the governor of carinthia was supported by a large part of the population in his home province .
" i have come to bid farewell to the best man carinthia ever had , " said gertrude naber-ehrlich , an elderly lady from klagenfurt .
in a ceremony that seemed fit for a head of state rather than for the deceased governor of carinthia , haider 's coffin was led in a procession around the city center .
the son of libyan leader moamer gaddafi , saif al-islam gaddafi , attended the ceremony .
he befriended haider during his post-graduate studies in vienna .
two presidents of northern italian regions , renzo tondo from friuli-venezia giulia and giancarlo galan from veneto , were also expected to participate .

but hamburg can still reclaim the top spot . hoffenheim , who are in their first-ever season in germany 's top flight having gained promotion last season after spending just one season in the second division , took the lead in hanover through vedad ibisevic after completely dominating the first half . hanover , however , came back strongly in the second half and went ahead through christian schulz and jiri stajner , but a goalkeeper mistake from florian fromlowitz , who was playing his first bundesliga game for the injured germany keeper robert enke gave hoffenheim the chance to draw level . fromlowitz palmed a long range effort to the feet of nigerian striker chinedu obasi , who made no mistake in the 70th minute .
two minutes later sejad salihovic put his side ahead . demba ba and ibisevic with his ninth goal of the season , which takes him to the top of the scorer charts , added to hanover 's misery , before arnold bruggink compounded the disaster for the home side with a red card shortly before the end of the game . bremen , dortmund draw on late goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals in bremen came fast and furious in the final minutes bayer leverkusen moved to third in the table with 15 points - one point behind hoffenheim and sv hamburg - after winning 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt . in bremen , fans were treated to a pulsating 3-3 draw between werder bremen and borussia dortmund in which three goals were scored in the last two minutes .
alexander frei 's opened the scoring for the visitors with a second half penalty after a foul by frank baumann . baumann then equalized for bremen , but mats hummels put dortmund back in the lead in the 72nd minute .
two minutes from the end dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfelder gifted bremen an equalizer through claudio pizarro . the peruvian international thought he had given his side the victory in injury time with a brilliant individual goal , but former bremen player nelson valdez managed an equalizer for the visitors after a mistake by bremen keeper tim wiese . bremen coach thomas schaaf said he was hoping for a victory before the game . " we should be upset about drawing a game in which you are winning 3-2 with less than a minute to go , " the coach said .
" the team was simply too passive in the end and we needed to have the strength to win . " bayern eek out win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern managed to get up and win against karlsruhe germany striker miroslav klose gave bayern coach juergen klinsmann a reprieve from the calls for his head by scoring the only goal of munich 's match against karlsruhe with just four minutes remaining in the game .
it was bayern 's first win in four league matches . klose converted italian defender massimo oddo 's cross on 86 minutes to give the bavarians three points despite another unimpressive performance . " from our point of view , the result is gratifying - of course it was important to get the three points , " said klinsmann .
" even if we had to wait a long , long time at least we got the result .
we threatened with a goal earlier in the game and it was such a relief that someone finally got the ball over the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin held back stuttgart for a win vfl wolfsburg managed to beat arminia bielefeld 4-1 through goals by zvjezdan misimovic , who scored twice , alexander madlung and grafite .
alexander laas pulled one back for bielefeld . the final game of the round ended in a 2-1 victory for hertha berlin against vfb stuttgart .
on friday vfl bochum drew 2-2 with borussia moenchengladbach . table toppers sv hamburg can move back to the head of the standings on sunday if they manage to beat schalke 04 at home .
a victory would take the team from northern germany to 19 points and give them a three point advantage over hoffenheim . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "
a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .

the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .

the meeting was initially supposed to focus on a possible free trade deal between canada and the eu . but the meeting 's new focus was announced by harper as he laid out a six-point economic plan following his re-election this week .
he promised to make sure canadian banks are not put at a disadvantage by rescue efforts in europe and the united states , where governments are pumping money into financial institutions to protect them . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 . representatives from multiple ministries met monday to coordinate a plan , according to the magazine .
the finance and economics ministries were tasked with opening talks with industry representatives to discuss sanctions . germany has maintained economic ties with iran and as one of its largest european trading partners .
spiegel reported that trade with iran has increased by 16.2 percent in the first half of 2008 , which has upset the european nation 's allies . a spokesman for the foreign ministry would not comment on the report saturday . no more spare western parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says sanctions wo n't bring down its economy according to the magazine , the german plans stem from a french proposal for like-minded countries to discourage business investment in iran so long as neither the united nations nor the european union has a coordinated plan for increased sanctions on iran . the united nations security council last attempted to pass tougher sanctions against iran in september but failed when pressure from russia kept the resolution from being passed . western countries strongly oppose iran 's pursuit of uranium enrichment , which they fear is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
led by the united states and european union members , the security council has imposed three sets of sanctions on teheran .
iran has said its nuclear program serves only to generate electricity . the national trade bans reportedly put in place in germany are intended to focus on products made exclusively by participating countries , making it hard for iran to find replacements from other countries not participating in the expanded un sanctions . earlier this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called attempts at pressuring iran to stop its enrichment program with unilateral sanctions " counterproductive . " moscow maintains that the " politics of adopting unilateral and anti-iranian sanctions espoused by some countries is counterproductive , " the foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 18.10.2008 spain calls for closer eu-georgia ties amid reports of clashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and the eu have good relations but some feel they should be closer spain will push for closer ties between the eu and georgia following the conflict with russia , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said saturday as gunfire is reported between rival groups in georgia . " i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .

experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

the finance and economics ministries were tasked with opening talks with industry representatives to discuss sanctions . germany has maintained economic ties with iran and as one of its largest european trading partners .

led by the united states and european union members , the security council has imposed three sets of sanctions on teheran .
iran has said its nuclear program serves only to generate electricity . the national trade bans reportedly put in place in germany are intended to focus on products made exclusively by participating countries , making it hard for iran to find replacements from other countries not participating in the expanded un sanctions . earlier this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called attempts at pressuring iran to stop its enrichment program with unilateral sanctions " counterproductive . " moscow maintains that the " politics of adopting unilateral and anti-iranian sanctions espoused by some countries is counterproductive , " the foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

martin blessing , the head of commerzbank - the country 's second largest - meanwhile told the bild daily in an interview published saturday that the bank would minutely examine the aid package .
" we will carefully examine the measures to see if they will interest us , " he said .

" deutsche bank does not need capital from the state , " ackermann was quoted as saying saturday the package , rushed through the german parliament on friday and immediately signed into law , comes into effect on monday .
starting on monday , banks can make direct requests for guarantees on loans of less than 36 months from other banks , with the government setting aside 400 billion euros for the purpose .
banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .
accords between the banks and the state are to be established on a case-by-case basis and will only be made public if a bank 's by-laws require it .
otherwise , they will remain confidential , said finance ministry spokesman torsten albig .

the finance ministry would like to set a limit of 500,000 euros on wages for top directors of banks that accept money and ban dividend payments .
the fund will exist until december 31 , 2009 , at which point it is to be liquidated " in the best interest of taxpayers . "
if the state still owns shares in banks , it will sell them at the right time for the best price .
it is only then that the total cost to taxpayers will be known .

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "
a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that the credit crisis could affect the real economy have been confirmed in europe , swedish plane maker saab said it would cut 500 jobs over two years after announcing heavy losses .
unemployment has grown across europe with key sectors such as car-makers badly hit as the downturn gathers pace .
the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .

a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that the credit crisis could affect the real economy have been confirmed in europe , swedish plane maker saab said it would cut 500 jobs over two years after announcing heavy losses .
unemployment has grown across europe with key sectors such as car-makers badly hit as the downturn gathers pace .
the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso head to the us after a visit to canada sarkozy and barroso head to camp david , the presidential retreat in the state of maryland , after meeting canadian prime minister stephen harper in quebec city to launch a process that might eventually lead to an " economic partnership " between canada and the eu .
the meeting was initially supposed to focus on a possible free trade deal between canada and the eu . but the meeting 's new focus was announced by harper as he laid out a six-point economic plan following his re-election this week .
he promised to make sure canadian banks are not put at a disadvantage by rescue efforts in europe and the united states , where governments are pumping money into financial institutions to protect them . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .

18 . representatives from multiple ministries met monday to coordinate a plan , according to the magazine .
the finance and economics ministries were tasked with opening talks with industry representatives to discuss sanctions . germany has maintained economic ties with iran and as one of its largest european trading partners .
spiegel reported that trade with iran has increased by 16.2 percent in the first half of 2008 , which has upset the european nation 's allies . a spokesman for the foreign ministry would not comment on the report saturday . no more spare western parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says sanctions wo n't bring down its economy according to the magazine , the german plans stem from a french proposal for like-minded countries to discourage business investment in iran so long as neither the united nations nor the european union has a coordinated plan for increased sanctions on iran . the united nations security council last attempted to pass tougher sanctions against iran in september but failed when pressure from russia kept the resolution from being passed . western countries strongly oppose iran 's pursuit of uranium enrichment , which they fear is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
led by the united states and european union members , the security council has imposed three sets of sanctions on teheran .
iran has said its nuclear program serves only to generate electricity . the national trade bans reportedly put in place in germany are intended to focus on products made exclusively by participating countries , making it hard for iran to find replacements from other countries not participating in the expanded un sanctions . earlier this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called attempts at pressuring iran to stop its enrichment program with unilateral sanctions " counterproductive . " moscow maintains that the " politics of adopting unilateral and anti-iranian sanctions espoused by some countries is counterproductive , " the foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" deutsche bank does not need capital from the state , " ackermann was quoted as saying saturday the package , rushed through the german parliament on friday and immediately signed into law , comes into effect on monday .
starting on monday , banks can make direct requests for guarantees on loans of less than 36 months from other banks , with the government setting aside 400 billion euros for the purpose .
banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .
accords between the banks and the state are to be established on a case-by-case basis and will only be made public if a bank 's by-laws require it .
otherwise , they will remain confidential , said finance ministry spokesman torsten albig .

the finance ministry would like to set a limit of 500,000 euros on wages for top directors of banks that accept money and ban dividend payments .
the fund will exist until december 31 , 2009 , at which point it is to be liquidated " in the best interest of taxpayers . "
if the state still owns shares in banks , it will sell them at the right time for the best price .
it is only then that the total cost to taxpayers will be known .
the charge is to be shared by federal authorities and individual states on a basis of 65 percent to 35 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .

georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .

" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .

he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .

martin blessing , the head of commerzbank - the country 's second largest - meanwhile told the bild daily in an interview published saturday that the bank would minutely examine the aid package .
" we will carefully examine the measures to see if they will interest us , " he said .

banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .

18 . representatives from multiple ministries met monday to coordinate a plan , according to the magazine .
the finance and economics ministries were tasked with opening talks with industry representatives to discuss sanctions . germany has maintained economic ties with iran and as one of its largest european trading partners .
spiegel reported that trade with iran has increased by 16.2 percent in the first half of 2008 , which has upset the european nation 's allies . a spokesman for the foreign ministry would not comment on the report saturday . no more spare western parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says sanctions wo n't bring down its economy according to the magazine , the german plans stem from a french proposal for like-minded countries to discourage business investment in iran so long as neither the united nations nor the european union has a coordinated plan for increased sanctions on iran . the united nations security council last attempted to pass tougher sanctions against iran in september but failed when pressure from russia kept the resolution from being passed . western countries strongly oppose iran 's pursuit of uranium enrichment , which they fear is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
led by the united states and european union members , the security council has imposed three sets of sanctions on teheran .
iran has said its nuclear program serves only to generate electricity . the national trade bans reportedly put in place in germany are intended to focus on products made exclusively by participating countries , making it hard for iran to find replacements from other countries not participating in the expanded un sanctions . earlier this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called attempts at pressuring iran to stop its enrichment program with unilateral sanctions " counterproductive . " moscow maintains that the " politics of adopting unilateral and anti-iranian sanctions espoused by some countries is counterproductive , " the foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .

corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "
a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that the credit crisis could affect the real economy have been confirmed in europe , swedish plane maker saab said it would cut 500 jobs over two years after announcing heavy losses .
unemployment has grown across europe with key sectors such as car-makers badly hit as the downturn gathers pace .
the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso head to the us after a visit to canada sarkozy and barroso head to camp david , the presidential retreat in the state of maryland , after meeting canadian prime minister stephen harper in quebec city to launch a process that might eventually lead to an " economic partnership " between canada and the eu .
the meeting was initially supposed to focus on a possible free trade deal between canada and the eu . but the meeting 's new focus was announced by harper as he laid out a six-point economic plan following his re-election this week .
he promised to make sure canadian banks are not put at a disadvantage by rescue efforts in europe and the united states , where governments are pumping money into financial institutions to protect them . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the markets are asking the question ' which country will be the next to fall ? '
the markets seem to have decided that hungary will be the next iceland .
however , there are other countries that share some unpleasant similarities with iceland , " said a danske bank report .

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "
a company official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told afp that a group finance director had been sacked over the loss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that the credit crisis could affect the real economy have been confirmed in europe , swedish plane maker saab said it would cut 500 jobs over two years after announcing heavy losses .
unemployment has grown across europe with key sectors such as car-makers badly hit as the downturn gathers pace .
the news came on a day of wild see-saw moves on wall street , lending added urgency to efforts on both sides of the atlantic to pass emergency rescue measures to shore up confidence in financial institutions . "
europeans taking bold steps " bush has been working with global leaders to create a common response to crumbling markets and teetering banks that have fueled worries of a worldwide recession .
in a speech at the us chamber of commerce , bush said he would continue " close consultations " with europe at the meeting with sarkozy and barroso .
" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 18.10.2008 spain calls for closer eu-georgia ties amid reports of clashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and the eu have good relations but some feel they should be closer spain will push for closer ties between the eu and georgia following the conflict with russia , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said saturday as gunfire is reported between rival groups in georgia . " i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg can still reclaim the top spot . hoffenheim , who are in their first-ever season in germany 's top flight having gained promotion last season after spending just one season in the second division , took the lead in hanover through vedad ibisevic after completely dominating the first half . hanover , however , came back strongly in the second half and went ahead through christian schulz and jiri stajner , but a goalkeeper mistake from florian fromlowitz , who was playing his first bundesliga game for the injured germany keeper robert enke gave hoffenheim the chance to draw level . fromlowitz palmed a long range effort to the feet of nigerian striker chinedu obasi , who made no mistake in the 70th minute .
two minutes later sejad salihovic put his side ahead . demba ba and ibisevic with his ninth goal of the season , which takes him to the top of the scorer charts , added to hanover 's misery , before arnold bruggink compounded the disaster for the home side with a red card shortly before the end of the game . bremen , dortmund draw on late goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals in bremen came fast and furious in the final minutes bayer leverkusen moved to third in the table with 15 points - one point behind hoffenheim and sv hamburg - after winning 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt . in bremen , fans were treated to a pulsating 3-3 draw between werder bremen and borussia dortmund in which three goals were scored in the last two minutes .
alexander frei 's opened the scoring for the visitors with a second half penalty after a foul by frank baumann . baumann then equalized for bremen , but mats hummels put dortmund back in the lead in the 72nd minute .
two minutes from the end dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfelder gifted bremen an equalizer through claudio pizarro . the peruvian international thought he had given his side the victory in injury time with a brilliant individual goal , but former bremen player nelson valdez managed an equalizer for the visitors after a mistake by bremen keeper tim wiese . bremen coach thomas schaaf said he was hoping for a victory before the game .

it was bayern 's first win in four league matches . klose converted italian defender massimo oddo 's cross on 86 minutes to give the bavarians three points despite another unimpressive performance . " from our point of view , the result is gratifying - of course it was important to get the three points , " said klinsmann .
" even if we had to wait a long , long time at least we got the result .

but hamburg can still reclaim the top spot . hoffenheim , who are in their first-ever season in germany 's top flight having gained promotion last season after spending just one season in the second division , took the lead in hanover through vedad ibisevic after completely dominating the first half . hanover , however , came back strongly in the second half and went ahead through christian schulz and jiri stajner , but a goalkeeper mistake from florian fromlowitz , who was playing his first bundesliga game for the injured germany keeper robert enke gave hoffenheim the chance to draw level . fromlowitz palmed a long range effort to the feet of nigerian striker chinedu obasi , who made no mistake in the 70th minute .
two minutes later sejad salihovic put his side ahead . demba ba and ibisevic with his ninth goal of the season , which takes him to the top of the scorer charts , added to hanover 's misery , before arnold bruggink compounded the disaster for the home side with a red card shortly before the end of the game . bremen , dortmund draw on late goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals in bremen came fast and furious in the final minutes bayer leverkusen moved to third in the table with 15 points - one point behind hoffenheim and sv hamburg - after winning 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt . in bremen , fans were treated to a pulsating 3-3 draw between werder bremen and borussia dortmund in which three goals were scored in the last two minutes .

it was bayern 's first win in four league matches . klose converted italian defender massimo oddo 's cross on 86 minutes to give the bavarians three points despite another unimpressive performance . " from our point of view , the result is gratifying - of course it was important to get the three points , " said klinsmann .
" even if we had to wait a long , long time at least we got the result .
we threatened with a goal earlier in the game and it was such a relief that someone finally got the ball over the line .

" the markets are asking the question ' which country will be the next to fall ? '
the markets seem to have decided that hungary will be the next iceland .
however , there are other countries that share some unpleasant similarities with iceland , " said a danske bank report .
the baltics make it onto a list of 15 countries danske bank thinks are " in the danger zone " and " at risk of a significant slowdown and increased financial distress " as a result of their large current account deficits , high credit growth in recent years and asset market bubbles , notably in real estate .
" it is not a given that these countries will undergo a similar collapse as iceland , but we think market participants should be very careful in these markets , " danske bank advised .
imf ready to bailout any faltering baltic state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief strauss-kahn says funds would be available a similar conclusion was drawn in a briefing note issued by london-based capital economics , though it suggested ukraine and not hungary is the most vulnerable economy in central and eastern europe at the moment .
" the good news is that the imf has ample funds to bail out the ukraine , or indeed any country in the region that comes under funding pressure , " capital economics said .
" the bad news is that even if the worst case scenario is averted , gdp growth in the ' super-deficit ' countries is likely to slow sharply next year .
with the exception of the baltics , outright recession is not yet our central forecast for these countries .
but it is looking more possible by the day . "
the three baltic stock exchanges lost more ground thursday , continuing a bad week on the financial markets .
tough week for baltic exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baltic exchanges have been taking hits all week the nasdaq omx tallinn exchange closed down 2.54 per cent , riga was down 3.82 per cent and the largest of the three baltic exchanges in vilnius dropped even more sharply , down 5.29 per cent .
the baltic benchmark index -lrb- bbi -rrb- which includes data from all three exchanges , closed down 4.50 per cent at 322.13 .
all three exchanges experienced similar falls wednesday , with the decline coming on the back of the downbeat report released by danske bank noting baltic exposure to credit default swap -lrb- cds -rrb- risks .
biggest loser of the day was a former stock market darling , lithuanian investment company invalda , which shed 14 per cent of its value . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the time has come for advancing the relationship between georgia and the european union , " moratinos said at a joint press conference with georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili .
" we are working on certain practical steps of visa facilitation , some free-trade relationship , but i think we need a political signal ... and this signal could be a potential agreement between georgia and the european union . "
moratinos met friday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and was to travel to the port of poti later saturday to meet a spanish contingent of eu monitors observing a ceasefire following georgia 's august war with russia .
the eu brokered the ceasefire agreement , has vowed to build closer ties with georgia following the conflict and has pledged up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 673 million -rrb- in reconstruction aid .
georgia is hoping that eu member nations will agree at an international donors conference in brussels on wednesday to match that sum between them .
russia sent troops into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia .
russian forces withdrew to within south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , earlier this month under the terms of the ceasefire .
but moscow plans to keep up to 7,600 troops in the two rebel regions , which it recognized as independent states after the conflict .
south ossetians accuse georgia of shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia separatists claim they were fired on the spanish statement came as russia-backed separatists in south ossetia accused georgian forces of firing on their soldiers in the first such reported incident since the brief war .
a spokesman for georgia 's interior ministry confirmed shooting in the area near the georgian village of nikozi but said it was coming from drunken russian soldiers at a border post and that they were firing into the air .
the spokesman also said that a russian spy plane had been spotted flying briefly into georgian airspace near the same village on saturday in what was " obviously " a violation of an eu-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the georgian side has fired on security force posts of the republic of south ossetia , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting the de facto interior minister of the province , mikhail mindzayev .
no casualties were reported from the shooting , the statement said .
" south ossetian security force posts near the georgian village of nikozi came under fire from machine guns and other firearms this morning .
it happened as south ossetian positions in the border zones were being set up , " he said .
south ossetia separatist leaders have since ordered their soldiers to return fire if shot at by georgian forces .
" from today all posts have been given an order to return fire if their posts come under fire , " the separatist government said on its official website , quoting mindzayev . the province 's leader , eduard kokoity , meanwhile accused european union monitors in the region of being biased , failing to uphold an eu-brokered ceasefire and making the situation worse , russian news agencies reported .
georgia 's interior ministry gave a very different account of the incident .
" drunk russian soldiers were firing into the air " at a security post near nikozi , which is located on the georgian side along the de facto border with south ossetia , said shota utiashvili , a spokesman for the ministry .
utiashvili also said : " a russian drone flew over nikozi this morning and then returned to tskhinvali , " the capital of south ossetia .
he said the spy plane was in georgian airspace for up to 20 minutes .
cross-border incidents on the rise despite ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians have been accused of firing at georgians this is the first time south ossetian authorities have reported shooting from georgian positions since a conflict in august between russian forces and south ossetian militias on one side and georgian forces on the other .
georgia has reported several shootings from the south ossetian side .
following the conflict with georgia , russia recognized south ossetia and abkhazia , another breakaway province of georgia , as independent states in a move that was roundly condemned by western powers and georgia .
tensions remain high despite a ceasefire in place in the region as georgian authorities have said russia must pull all its forces out of south ossetia and abkhazia in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from the rest of georgia with russian backing in the early 1990s in conflict that killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands of georgians to flee their homes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , deutsche bank says it does n't need help . private and regional banks will discuss the common approach , an upcoming edition of focus magazine due to be published monday said , citing an unnamed senior bank official .
martin blessing , the head of commerzbank - the country 's second largest - meanwhile told the bild daily in an interview published saturday that the bank would minutely examine the aid package .
" we will carefully examine the measures to see if they will interest us , " he said .
however , deutsche bank ag 's chief executive has been quoted as saying that his company does n't need an injection of capital under the government 's financial rescue package .
deutsche bank refutes need for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann says his bank will not need state aid the bild am sonntag weekly reports in a preview of its sunday edition that josef ackermann said deutsche bank has " at no point " been in danger during the financial market crisis .
" deutsche bank does not need capital from the state , " ackermann was quoted as saying saturday the package , rushed through the german parliament on friday and immediately signed into law , comes into effect on monday .
starting on monday , banks can make direct requests for guarantees on loans of less than 36 months from other banks , with the government setting aside 400 billion euros for the purpose .
banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .
accords between the banks and the state are to be established on a case-by-case basis and will only be made public if a bank 's by-laws require it .
otherwise , they will remain confidential , said finance ministry spokesman torsten albig .
banks must accept conditions before aid is agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue is at hand but the banks have to work for it banks must accept certain conditions in return for the aid , with the state being given a say in bank strategy , the use of the funds , remuneration of state organs and dividend policy .
other conditions are to be established during a cabinet meeting early monday or on a case-by-case basis .
the finance ministry would like to set a limit of 500,000 euros on wages for top directors of banks that accept money and ban dividend payments .
the fund will exist until december 31 , 2009 , at which point it is to be liquidated " in the best interest of taxpayers . "
if the state still owns shares in banks , it will sell them at the right time for the best price .
it is only then that the total cost to taxpayers will be known .
the charge is to be shared by federal authorities and individual states on a basis of 65 percent to 35 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .

corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "

the women are sent abroad to be prostitutes , men are forced into slave-like wage labor and children have to become beggars . he 's heard the remarks that you never know what you 're getting into when you go abroad , nods viorel gorceag as he loses the calm that he normally emanates .
" what do you think ? " he asks .
" do you think any of those that went abroad ever dreamt they 'd be assaulted 70 times a day , be sold for a dollar per minute , beaten or forced to take drugs or give birth to a child only so that it could be sold later ? "
" i could tell you stories , " says viorel gorceag .
" you would ask how something like that is possible . "
the young psychologist with large hands and dark eyes runs moldova 's only rehabilitation center for victims of human trafficking .
he also took care of maria .
she was brought from chisinau to moscow to work on the market as a saleswoman .
but when she arrived in the capital , she was suddenly forced into street prostitution .
beaten into prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims end up in desitute conditions following a fake job offer rescued after three months by pure chance , she can now put her trust in the psychologist from the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
her pimps " beat her and locked her in a basement for three days without any food or water . "
when they let her out , she gave in and worked on the streets .
" if i did n't want to go with a john , i would be beaten , " the young woman explains .
maria , whose name has been changed , is one of the more than 2,000 women that gorceag and the iom team were able to help between 2001 and 2006 .
the organization ' rehabilitation center has been housed in a new building of a chisinau clinic for a year and half now .
there is a kitchen and dining room on the main floor and the women 's and children 's room are on the floor above .
there are also offices and doctors ' rooms , as well as a playroom and a fitness room .
corrupt government officials involved ?
in the beginning , the rehabilitation center was financed solely by the iom .
since 2007 , however , it has also been receiving support from the moldovan government , which is also operating a reintegration program and diverse prevention measures .
despite these measures , there are accusations , for example , from the american ministry of foreign affairs that corrupt government officials are also entangled in the human trafficking .
ana ravenco is the director of " lad strada , " a help organization that has been operating an emergency hotline for victims of human trafficking since 2001 .
the organization also offers information that is intended to prevent human trafficking .
according to ravenco , in moldova the lack of money paved the way for a booming modern slave trade .
slave traders among acquaintances " many women decide to leave the country because of poverty , the lack of perspectives and due to other economic factors like the wide-spread domestic violence , " explains ravenco .
" women receive false job offers , which sadly come most of the time from people within their circle of friends or relatives – from people they trust . "
instead of doing housework for family acquaintances in italy as promised , the girls – who are mostly between the ages of 19 and 29 – end up in a nightclub in turkey where they are forced to work in the sex trade .
since they can neither speak the language nor do they know a single person – plus most of the time their passport was taken from them – they are completely helpless .
gaining perspective against the stigmatization in order to offer long-term perspective to the victims of human trafficking in search of help and to protect them from a social stigmatization upon their return to moldova , the rehabilitation center in chisinau educates the women in the field of business .
this starts by helping them with small loans .
and it is successful .
only about five percent of the victims make their way back to their torturers , says project leader victor lutenco .
" long-term reintegration programs are indispensable for the rehabilitation of human trafficking victims , " he emphasizes .
" these programs are conducted where the victims live , because otherwise this group of people would be exposed to a high risk of once again finding themselves in the hands of human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are n't the only victims of human trafficking men and children also victims the imo and non-government organizations like " la strada " have to be thanked for the fact that there are any numbers on human trafficking victims at all .
as of now , there is no central database for human trafficking in the republic of moldova .
experts estimate that there have been several thousand moldovan victims of human trafficking since the country gained independence from the former soviet republic .
women are just a part of the group affected .
children are employed as beggars , human organs are sold and moldovan men are forced into modern-day slavery on foreign construction sites , in warehouses and field work .
somewhere in between western europe and the middle east .
the men , says viorel gorceag , have the most problems admitting their exploitation .
the ones who go back are often spoken about as having had no luck .

in further signs of a looming recession , new reports on friday showed that us consumer confidence and new-home construction plummeted to new lows .
in france , the finance industry 's reputation took a new blow as the caisse d 'epargne bank said it lost about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- in a trading " incident . "

" our european partners are taking bold steps .
they show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
and they have the full support of the united states , " bush said , adding that government interventions to stop the crisis needed time to work .
bush 's comments came a day after germany 's parliament , in a historic fast-track vote , passed a 500-million-euro bank rescue package to restore shattered confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said government interventions to stop the crisis need time to work but bush did not specifically mention calls by european leaders this week to reform the financial system that the world has been operating under since 1944 .
white house spokeswoman dana perino said the us focus was on the immediate crisis .
" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .
" i think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with , " she said .

" i think the most important thing we can do is make sure that we stop the bleeding here before we move on to the next project , " she told reporters .
no significant policy announcements expected earlier , perino also sought to play down the significance of the sarkozy-bush meeting , saying it was unlikely to result in any specific measures .
" i do n't believe that tomorrow night 's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working towards that , " perino told reporters .

" the markets are asking the question ' which country will be the next to fall ? '
the markets seem to have decided that hungary will be the next iceland .
however , there are other countries that share some unpleasant similarities with iceland , " said a danske bank report .
the baltics make it onto a list of 15 countries danske bank thinks are " in the danger zone " and " at risk of a significant slowdown and increased financial distress " as a result of their large current account deficits , high credit growth in recent years and asset market bubbles , notably in real estate .
" it is not a given that these countries will undergo a similar collapse as iceland , but we think market participants should be very careful in these markets , " danske bank advised .

" the good news is that the imf has ample funds to bail out the ukraine , or indeed any country in the region that comes under funding pressure , " capital economics said .
" the bad news is that even if the worst case scenario is averted , gdp growth in the ' super-deficit ' countries is likely to slow sharply next year .
with the exception of the baltics , outright recession is not yet our central forecast for these countries .
but it is looking more possible by the day . "
the three baltic stock exchanges lost more ground thursday , continuing a bad week on the financial markets .
tough week for baltic exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baltic exchanges have been taking hits all week the nasdaq omx tallinn exchange closed down 2.54 per cent , riga was down 3.82 per cent and the largest of the three baltic exchanges in vilnius dropped even more sharply , down 5.29 per cent .
the baltic benchmark index -lrb- bbi -rrb- which includes data from all three exchanges , closed down 4.50 per cent at 322.13 .
all three exchanges experienced similar falls wednesday , with the decline coming on the back of the downbeat report released by danske bank noting baltic exposure to credit default swap -lrb- cds -rrb- risks .

but hamburg can still reclaim the top spot . hoffenheim , who are in their first-ever season in germany 's top flight having gained promotion last season after spending just one season in the second division , took the lead in hanover through vedad ibisevic after completely dominating the first half . hanover , however , came back strongly in the second half and went ahead through christian schulz and jiri stajner , but a goalkeeper mistake from florian fromlowitz , who was playing his first bundesliga game for the injured germany keeper robert enke gave hoffenheim the chance to draw level . fromlowitz palmed a long range effort to the feet of nigerian striker chinedu obasi , who made no mistake in the 70th minute .
two minutes later sejad salihovic put his side ahead . demba ba and ibisevic with his ninth goal of the season , which takes him to the top of the scorer charts , added to hanover 's misery , before arnold bruggink compounded the disaster for the home side with a red card shortly before the end of the game . bremen , dortmund draw on late goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals in bremen came fast and furious in the final minutes bayer leverkusen moved to third in the table with 15 points - one point behind hoffenheim and sv hamburg - after winning 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt . in bremen , fans were treated to a pulsating 3-3 draw between werder bremen and borussia dortmund in which three goals were scored in the last two minutes .

two minutes from the end dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfelder gifted bremen an equalizer through claudio pizarro . the peruvian international thought he had given his side the victory in injury time with a brilliant individual goal , but former bremen player nelson valdez managed an equalizer for the visitors after a mistake by bremen keeper tim wiese . bremen coach thomas schaaf said he was hoping for a victory before the game . " we should be upset about drawing a game in which you are winning 3-2 with less than a minute to go , " the coach said .
" the team was simply too passive in the end and we needed to have the strength to win . " bayern eek out win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern managed to get up and win against karlsruhe germany striker miroslav klose gave bayern coach juergen klinsmann a reprieve from the calls for his head by scoring the only goal of munich 's match against karlsruhe with just four minutes remaining in the game .
it was bayern 's first win in four league matches . klose converted italian defender massimo oddo 's cross on 86 minutes to give the bavarians three points despite another unimpressive performance . " from our point of view , the result is gratifying - of course it was important to get the three points , " said klinsmann .
" even if we had to wait a long , long time at least we got the result .
we threatened with a goal earlier in the game and it was such a relief that someone finally got the ball over the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin held back stuttgart for a win vfl wolfsburg managed to beat arminia bielefeld 4-1 through goals by zvjezdan misimovic , who scored twice , alexander madlung and grafite .

two minutes later sejad salihovic put his side ahead . demba ba and ibisevic with his ninth goal of the season , which takes him to the top of the scorer charts , added to hanover 's misery , before arnold bruggink compounded the disaster for the home side with a red card shortly before the end of the game . bremen , dortmund draw on late goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals in bremen came fast and furious in the final minutes bayer leverkusen moved to third in the table with 15 points - one point behind hoffenheim and sv hamburg - after winning 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt . in bremen , fans were treated to a pulsating 3-3 draw between werder bremen and borussia dortmund in which three goals were scored in the last two minutes .
alexander frei 's opened the scoring for the visitors with a second half penalty after a foul by frank baumann . baumann then equalized for bremen , but mats hummels put dortmund back in the lead in the 72nd minute .
two minutes from the end dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfelder gifted bremen an equalizer through claudio pizarro . the peruvian international thought he had given his side the victory in injury time with a brilliant individual goal , but former bremen player nelson valdez managed an equalizer for the visitors after a mistake by bremen keeper tim wiese . bremen coach thomas schaaf said he was hoping for a victory before the game . " we should be upset about drawing a game in which you are winning 3-2 with less than a minute to go , " the coach said .
" the team was simply too passive in the end and we needed to have the strength to win . " bayern eek out win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern managed to get up and win against karlsruhe germany striker miroslav klose gave bayern coach juergen klinsmann a reprieve from the calls for his head by scoring the only goal of munich 's match against karlsruhe with just four minutes remaining in the game .
it was bayern 's first win in four league matches . klose converted italian defender massimo oddo 's cross on 86 minutes to give the bavarians three points despite another unimpressive performance . " from our point of view , the result is gratifying - of course it was important to get the three points , " said klinsmann .
" even if we had to wait a long , long time at least we got the result .
we threatened with a goal earlier in the game and it was such a relief that someone finally got the ball over the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin held back stuttgart for a win vfl wolfsburg managed to beat arminia bielefeld 4-1 through goals by zvjezdan misimovic , who scored twice , alexander madlung and grafite .

martin blessing , the head of commerzbank - the country 's second largest - meanwhile told the bild daily in an interview published saturday that the bank would minutely examine the aid package .

" deutsche bank does not need capital from the state , " ackermann was quoted as saying saturday the package , rushed through the german parliament on friday and immediately signed into law , comes into effect on monday .
starting on monday , banks can make direct requests for guarantees on loans of less than 36 months from other banks , with the government setting aside 400 billion euros for the purpose .
banks can also ask the state for fresh funds in exchange for equity stakes , from another fund worth a total 80 billion euros .
accords between the banks and the state are to be established on a case-by-case basis and will only be made public if a bank 's by-laws require it .

the finance ministry would like to set a limit of 500,000 euros on wages for top directors of banks that accept money and ban dividend payments .
the fund will exist until december 31 , 2009 , at which point it is to be liquidated " in the best interest of taxpayers . "
if the state still owns shares in banks , it will sell them at the right time for the best price .
it is only then that the total cost to taxpayers will be known .
