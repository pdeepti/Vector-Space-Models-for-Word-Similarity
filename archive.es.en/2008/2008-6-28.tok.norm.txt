german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .
now we know that this america will hardly change under a president barack obama . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .

the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday . " history has shown us that they -lrb- sanctions -rrb- do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , " kenyan foreign minister moses wetangula told reporters at a meeting of african foreign ministers ahead of the summit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann .

in parts of eastern europe , the gathering of gays and lesbians to protest discrimination ended in violence and arrests . on the 30th annual christopher street day , tens of thousands of gays and lesbians defied the rain to walk the streets of berlin in exotic costumes , waving rainbow flags and drawing attention to their campaign for awareness and tolerance .
the parade , which recalls the events of june 28 , 1969 , when new york gays stood up to arbitrary police intimidation , started in east berlin and made its way along the boulevard unter den linden to the victory column in west berlin .
several prominent german politicians took part in the event to celebrate diversity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 95-year-old rudolf brazda survived the nazi persecution of homosexuals in buchenwald this year 's berlin parade was dedicated to highlighting the continuing violence directed against gays and lesbians and began with a memorial tribute to the many victims of nazi persecution of homosexuals between 1933 and 1945 .
in paris , more than half a million people took part in a gay pride parade under the motto " for a school without any discrimination , " dedicated to the fight against racism , sexism and xenophobia among young people .
among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .
the conservative governing party ump and the centrist modem were also represented .
rightwing extremists block peaceful demonstrations in many eastern european countries , where gay pride parades were held for the first time , participants clashed with angry counter-demonstrators and police were forced to make several arrests .
at least 20 people were injured when the czech republic 's first-ever gay pride parade was attacked by rightwing extremists armed with tear gas even before the event was due to begin in the city of brno .
three people were arrested when counter-demonstrators threw fireworks at the gathering of lesbians and gays in which an estimated 500 were expected to participate .
with calls in the internet for resistance to the " queer parade , " more than 200 police were present during the planned event .
local news media reported the presence of 150 aggressive counter-demonstrators and hundreds of onlookers .
among the supporters of the parade were czech minister of human rights and minorities dzamila stehlikova and tennis legend martina navratilova .
czech same-sex unions have enjoyed official recognition since 2006 .
bulgarian nationalists protest against homosexuality in bulgaria the country 's first gay pride parade ended in more than 60 arrests .
according to the interior ministry , bulgarian police arrested some 60 extremists who had attempted to use force to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital sofia .
a large police presence had been able to separate the several dozen parade participants from opponents from nationalist groups who threw firecrackers .
already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .
activists for more solidarity and understanding participants in the parade , which was organized by the bulgarian gay and lesbian group gemini , held a huge rainbow flag and a banner calling for " solidarity against homophobia . "
" bulgaria is in the eu now .
people have to accept us like normal human beings .
we are not criminals , " 51-year-old german engineer peter moews who lives in sofia told the afp news agency .
" hostility comes from misunderstanding .
most people think that we are all feminine and wear women dresses but this is not true , " he added .
gays and lesbians in bulgaria have faced widespread hostility since the communist era although there were no discriminatory laws or practices against them .
prime minister sergey stanishev said friday that he " accepts people with different sexual orientation but does not quite approve of the demonstrations of such an orientation .

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday . " history has shown us that they -lrb- sanctions -rrb- do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , " kenyan foreign minister moses wetangula told reporters at a meeting of african foreign ministers ahead of the summit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

some 43 countries have recognized the independent state including most european union members .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .

the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " rollercoaster ride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann in action during a friendly match against austria in february it has been very much an up-and-down career for the man who now leaves arsenal for at least one more season at the top level with germany 's vfb stuttgart . lehmann spent five seasons in london after previously playing for borussia dortmund , schalke 04 and , for a short time , ac milan .
his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .
every team i played for i made it to a european cup final , " lehmann said after germany made sure of their place in the final . with arsenal he reached the final of 2006 champions league -lrb- and was sent off against barcelona -rrb- , he won the uefa cup with schalke in 1997 and made the final again with dortmund in 2002 . he just missed out on the final of the 2006 world cup after germany were beaten by italy in the semi-finals . a winner 's medal on sunday would undoubtedly make any retirement decisions a little bit easier to take . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany captain michael ballack is doubtful for the euro 2008 final on sunday against spain .
an injury to his right calf prevented him from attending the team 's final training session . germany coach joachim loew confirmed ballack 's injury just a day before the 31-year-old midfielder was posed to lead his team against spain in the european championship in vienna .
" michael ballack has n't been able to train for two days .
his calf has hardened up , " loew told the press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack missed the final training on june 28 .
" it was n't possible for him to train today either but we will see how the situation develops overnight .
our medical team is working constantly to try to give him every possible chance of playing . "
not all hope is lost ballack has complained since friday of the problem to his right calf muscle .
" it 's not exactly the optimal situation .
yesterday -lrb- friday , june 27 -rrb- , he noticed a strain in the calf muscle .
he is now undergoing constant treatment .
we are n't giving up hope , " said team manager oliver bierhoff .
the german football federation said that a decision on whether ballack can play on sunday is still open and will be decided at short notice .
the germany captain is a key player in the team .
scouring two goals during the euro 2008 tournament , ballack was also designated the outstanding player in the 3-2 win over portugal in the quarter-finals .
ballack was less impressive against turkey in the semi-finals , but his absence would be a huge blow to the team , who are bidding for their fourth european championship title .
bildunterschrift : ballack scores the opening goal after a free kick during the austria match june 16 borowski or schweinsteiger as replacement if ballack fails to recover in time for the final match , loew said either tim borowski or bastian schweinsteiger would fill his forward midfield role .
bierhoff told the german national broadcaster ard that he expected the team to rally together to overcome the final hurdle against spain .
" the players want to take that final step , " he said .
" the team has shown determination throughout the tournament to get through the highs and lows .
the players now want to take that final step . "
ballack has never played in a major final for germany .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci speaks during a celebration of kosovo 's constitution in pristina june 15 ninety percent of kosovo 's two million people are albanians .
four months ago they declared independence from serbia , despite opposition from belgrade and strong intervention from moscow , which called the secession a violation of international law .
some 43 countries have recognized the independent state including most european union members .
kosovo 's new constitution went into effect june 15 , paving the way for the creation of eulex , a 2,000-strong eu police and justice mission .
the un 's unmik mission which has run kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 ousted serbian forces will transfer its main responsibilities to eulex and kosovar authorities . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .
every team i played for i made it to a european cup final , " lehmann said after germany made sure of their place in the final . with arsenal he reached the final of 2006 champions league -lrb- and was sent off against barcelona -rrb- , he won the uefa cup with schalke in 1997 and made the final again with dortmund in 2002 . he just missed out on the final of the 2006 world cup after germany were beaten by italy in the semi-finals . a winner 's medal on sunday would undoubtedly make any retirement decisions a little bit easier to take . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 .

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "
" we want to win this final , " said forward lukas podolski , and lahm agreed : " we want to bring the title to germany . " dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in parts of eastern europe , the gathering of gays and lesbians to protest discrimination ended in violence and arrests . on the 30th annual christopher street day , tens of thousands of gays and lesbians defied the rain to walk the streets of berlin in exotic costumes , waving rainbow flags and drawing attention to their campaign for awareness and tolerance .
the parade , which recalls the events of june 28 , 1969 , when new york gays stood up to arbitrary police intimidation , started in east berlin and made its way along the boulevard unter den linden to the victory column in west berlin .
several prominent german politicians took part in the event to celebrate diversity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 95-year-old rudolf brazda survived the nazi persecution of homosexuals in buchenwald this year 's berlin parade was dedicated to highlighting the continuing violence directed against gays and lesbians and began with a memorial tribute to the many victims of nazi persecution of homosexuals between 1933 and 1945 .
in paris , more than half a million people took part in a gay pride parade under the motto " for a school without any discrimination , " dedicated to the fight against racism , sexism and xenophobia among young people .
among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .
the conservative governing party ump and the centrist modem were also represented .
rightwing extremists block peaceful demonstrations in many eastern european countries , where gay pride parades were held for the first time , participants clashed with angry counter-demonstrators and police were forced to make several arrests .
at least 20 people were injured when the czech republic 's first-ever gay pride parade was attacked by rightwing extremists armed with tear gas even before the event was due to begin in the city of brno .
three people were arrested when counter-demonstrators threw fireworks at the gathering of lesbians and gays in which an estimated 500 were expected to participate .
with calls in the internet for resistance to the " queer parade , " more than 200 police were present during the planned event .
local news media reported the presence of 150 aggressive counter-demonstrators and hundreds of onlookers .
among the supporters of the parade were czech minister of human rights and minorities dzamila stehlikova and tennis legend martina navratilova .
czech same-sex unions have enjoyed official recognition since 2006 .
bulgarian nationalists protest against homosexuality in bulgaria the country 's first gay pride parade ended in more than 60 arrests .
according to the interior ministry , bulgarian police arrested some 60 extremists who had attempted to use force to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital sofia .
a large police presence had been able to separate the several dozen parade participants from opponents from nationalist groups who threw firecrackers .
already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .
activists for more solidarity and understanding participants in the parade , which was organized by the bulgarian gay and lesbian group gemini , held a huge rainbow flag and a banner calling for " solidarity against homophobia . "
" bulgaria is in the eu now .
people have to accept us like normal human beings .
we are not criminals , " 51-year-old german engineer peter moews who lives in sofia told the afp news agency .
" hostility comes from misunderstanding .
most people think that we are all feminine and wear women dresses but this is not true , " he added .
gays and lesbians in bulgaria have faced widespread hostility since the communist era although there were no discriminatory laws or practices against them .
prime minister sergey stanishev said friday that he " accepts people with different sexual orientation but does not quite approve of the demonstrations of such an orientation .

already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday .

in parts of eastern europe , the gathering of gays and lesbians to protest discrimination ended in violence and arrests . on the 30th annual christopher street day , tens of thousands of gays and lesbians defied the rain to walk the streets of berlin in exotic costumes , waving rainbow flags and drawing attention to their campaign for awareness and tolerance .
the parade , which recalls the events of june 28 , 1969 , when new york gays stood up to arbitrary police intimidation , started in east berlin and made its way along the boulevard unter den linden to the victory column in west berlin .
several prominent german politicians took part in the event to celebrate diversity .

in paris , more than half a million people took part in a gay pride parade under the motto " for a school without any discrimination , " dedicated to the fight against racism , sexism and xenophobia among young people .
among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .

three people were arrested when counter-demonstrators threw fireworks at the gathering of lesbians and gays in which an estimated 500 were expected to participate .
with calls in the internet for resistance to the " queer parade , " more than 200 police were present during the planned event .
local news media reported the presence of 150 aggressive counter-demonstrators and hundreds of onlookers .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci speaks during a celebration of kosovo 's constitution in pristina june 15 ninety percent of kosovo 's two million people are albanians .
four months ago they declared independence from serbia , despite opposition from belgrade and strong intervention from moscow , which called the secession a violation of international law .
some 43 countries have recognized the independent state including most european union members .
kosovo 's new constitution went into effect june 15 , paving the way for the creation of eulex , a 2,000-strong eu police and justice mission .
the un 's unmik mission which has run kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 ousted serbian forces will transfer its main responsibilities to eulex and kosovar authorities . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " rollercoaster ride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann in action during a friendly match against austria in february it has been very much an up-and-down career for the man who now leaves arsenal for at least one more season at the top level with germany 's vfb stuttgart . lehmann spent five seasons in london after previously playing for borussia dortmund , schalke 04 and , for a short time , ac milan .
his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .
every team i played for i made it to a european cup final , " lehmann said after germany made sure of their place in the final . with arsenal he reached the final of 2006 champions league -lrb- and was sent off against barcelona -rrb- , he won the uefa cup with schalke in 1997 and made the final again with dortmund in 2002 . he just missed out on the final of the 2006 world cup after germany were beaten by italy in the semi-finals . a winner 's medal on sunday would undoubtedly make any retirement decisions a little bit easier to take . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

four months ago they declared independence from serbia , despite opposition from belgrade and strong intervention from moscow , which called the secession a violation of international law .
some 43 countries have recognized the independent state including most european union members .
kosovo 's new constitution went into effect june 15 , paving the way for the creation of eulex , a 2,000-strong eu police and justice mission .

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

in parts of eastern europe , the gathering of gays and lesbians to protest discrimination ended in violence and arrests . on the 30th annual christopher street day , tens of thousands of gays and lesbians defied the rain to walk the streets of berlin in exotic costumes , waving rainbow flags and drawing attention to their campaign for awareness and tolerance .
the parade , which recalls the events of june 28 , 1969 , when new york gays stood up to arbitrary police intimidation , started in east berlin and made its way along the boulevard unter den linden to the victory column in west berlin .
several prominent german politicians took part in the event to celebrate diversity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 95-year-old rudolf brazda survived the nazi persecution of homosexuals in buchenwald this year 's berlin parade was dedicated to highlighting the continuing violence directed against gays and lesbians and began with a memorial tribute to the many victims of nazi persecution of homosexuals between 1933 and 1945 .
in paris , more than half a million people took part in a gay pride parade under the motto " for a school without any discrimination , " dedicated to the fight against racism , sexism and xenophobia among young people .
among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .
the conservative governing party ump and the centrist modem were also represented .
rightwing extremists block peaceful demonstrations in many eastern european countries , where gay pride parades were held for the first time , participants clashed with angry counter-demonstrators and police were forced to make several arrests .
at least 20 people were injured when the czech republic 's first-ever gay pride parade was attacked by rightwing extremists armed with tear gas even before the event was due to begin in the city of brno .
three people were arrested when counter-demonstrators threw fireworks at the gathering of lesbians and gays in which an estimated 500 were expected to participate .
with calls in the internet for resistance to the " queer parade , " more than 200 police were present during the planned event .
local news media reported the presence of 150 aggressive counter-demonstrators and hundreds of onlookers .
among the supporters of the parade were czech minister of human rights and minorities dzamila stehlikova and tennis legend martina navratilova .
czech same-sex unions have enjoyed official recognition since 2006 .
bulgarian nationalists protest against homosexuality in bulgaria the country 's first gay pride parade ended in more than 60 arrests .
according to the interior ministry , bulgarian police arrested some 60 extremists who had attempted to use force to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital sofia .
a large police presence had been able to separate the several dozen parade participants from opponents from nationalist groups who threw firecrackers .
already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .
activists for more solidarity and understanding participants in the parade , which was organized by the bulgarian gay and lesbian group gemini , held a huge rainbow flag and a banner calling for " solidarity against homophobia . "
" bulgaria is in the eu now .
people have to accept us like normal human beings .
we are not criminals , " 51-year-old german engineer peter moews who lives in sofia told the afp news agency .
" hostility comes from misunderstanding .
most people think that we are all feminine and wear women dresses but this is not true , " he added .
gays and lesbians in bulgaria have faced widespread hostility since the communist era although there were no discriminatory laws or practices against them .
prime minister sergey stanishev said friday that he " accepts people with different sexual orientation but does not quite approve of the demonstrations of such an orientation .

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday . " history has shown us that they -lrb- sanctions -rrb- do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , " kenyan foreign minister moses wetangula told reporters at a meeting of african foreign ministers ahead of the summit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday . " history has shown us that they -lrb- sanctions -rrb- do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , " kenyan foreign minister moses wetangula told reporters at a meeting of african foreign ministers ahead of the summit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 28.06.2008 germany 's jens lehmann : going out a winner ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro 2008 win could be a chance for a graceful exit for lehmann , but nothing 's certain speculation is rife about the future of germany goalkeeper jens lehmann .
at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .
the project is modest by aeronautic standards , estimated at 15 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- .
the satellite would scan the space for so-called near earth objects -lrb- neos -rrb- .
any celestial body which orbits the sun on a track that crosses the earth 's orbit is considered an neo .
the german space agency dlr said modeling showed there must be more than 1,000 such objects more than 100 meters -lrb- 328 feet -rrb- wide , but only nine have been discovered so far .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of an asteroid lit up the skies of southern spain in 2003 the announcement was made just before the 100th anniversary of an asteroid that exploded over siberia , destroying 2,000 square kilometers -lrb- 770 square miles -rrb- of forest .
the june 30 , 1908 tunguska event is thought to have been caused by a rock 30 to 50 meters wide .
" it 's vital to identify neos before they get onto a collision course with the earth , " said ekkehard kuehrt of the dlr planetary research institute .
development work on the satellite is scheduled to begin this autumn .
the satellite would also track space junk , which consists of satellite debris orbiting the earth .
dlr says that with sufficient warning time , such as 10 years , an neo could be nudged away into an orbit that did not threaten the earth .
a spacecraft could crash into the neo and knock off a chunk , leading to a change in the neo 's course . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .
now we know that this america will hardly change under a president barack obama . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .
now we know that this america will hardly change under a president barack obama . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " rollercoaster ride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann in action during a friendly match against austria in february it has been very much an up-and-down career for the man who now leaves arsenal for at least one more season at the top level with germany 's vfb stuttgart . lehmann spent five seasons in london after previously playing for borussia dortmund , schalke 04 and , for a short time , ac milan .
his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .
every team i played for i made it to a european cup final , " lehmann said after germany made sure of their place in the final . with arsenal he reached the final of 2006 champions league -lrb- and was sent off against barcelona -rrb- , he won the uefa cup with schalke in 1997 and made the final again with dortmund in 2002 . he just missed out on the final of the 2006 world cup after germany were beaten by italy in the semi-finals . a winner 's medal on sunday would undoubtedly make any retirement decisions a little bit easier to take . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists will develop a satellite to track them in time to prevent catastrophy . german scientists said this week that they are planning a satellite especially to hunt asteroids that might crash into the earth .

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

" we are happy to make the final .
there is no more pressure now , we want to enjoy it .
we are really looking forward to the final , " loew told a news conference at the team 's euro camp in southern switzerland .
philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

philipp lahm was the hero with a 90th-minute winner after germany were at times outplayed by a lively turkey team .
the match resembled the game against croatia in the group stage where germany lost 2-1 .
loew admitted that he continued to pack the midfield with five men because he did n't want to fall behind in the second half .
" i do n't know whether we could have made up a deficit in the second half , " he admitted .
the tactics worked well in the 3-2 quarter-final defeat of portugal where the germans played a classy match , but loew said that you ca n't expect consistency at such a tournament .
never-say-die bildunterschrift : german players celebrate their 3-2 win over turkey loew praised the famed german fighting spirit when questioned by a bbc reporter whether it was luck or german values that earned the three-time champions at world cups and euros a 13th major final .
" just lucky , " he quipped before adding on a serious note : " i believe that we have this faith in ourselves to turn around matters through our tournament experience from many years .
our team has developed this mentality to believe in victory even if we do n't play well .
the winning mentality is strong in germany and has always been a trademark of the team . "
for loew personally , it is instant success in his first big event as head coach , a feat only jupp derwall achieved before when he won euro 1980 .
" it is very special for me to be in the final .
i cherish this moment , " said loew .
he said he had no preference when it comes to the opponent , saying that both spain and russia " play outstanding soccer . "
the coach did not reveal whether he will use the same motivation program on sunday as he did ahead of the semi-final when he showed the players a dvd with footage from the big german crowds at the fan zones .
" i showed them the millions of fans supporting us , " said loew .
fans ' expectations bildunterschrift : german fans in a joyous mood the team will have to live up to the expectations again on sunday with chancellor angela merkel in the stadium again and former coach juergen klinsmann also invited to watch the team he originally formed during his 2004-2006 reign with loew as assistant .
but the players insist that they are ready to deliver now that they have almost reached the summit of the german " mountain tour 2008 . "

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes , " koepke said .
" i did n't see jens as critically as others .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " rollercoaster ride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann in action during a friendly match against austria in february it has been very much an up-and-down career for the man who now leaves arsenal for at least one more season at the top level with germany 's vfb stuttgart . lehmann spent five seasons in london after previously playing for borussia dortmund , schalke 04 and , for a short time , ac milan .
his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann . " in my career i was very fortunate .
every team i played for i made it to a european cup final , " lehmann said after germany made sure of their place in the final . with arsenal he reached the final of 2006 champions league -lrb- and was sent off against barcelona -rrb- , he won the uefa cup with schalke in 1997 and made the final again with dortmund in 2002 . he just missed out on the final of the 2006 world cup after germany were beaten by italy in the semi-finals . a winner 's medal on sunday would undoubtedly make any retirement decisions a little bit easier to take . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

some 43 countries have recognized the independent state including most european union members .
kosovo 's new constitution went into effect june 15 , paving the way for the creation of eulex , a 2,000-strong eu police and justice mission .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

among the supporters of the parade were czech minister of human rights and minorities dzamila stehlikova and tennis legend martina navratilova .
czech same-sex unions have enjoyed official recognition since 2006 .
bulgarian nationalists protest against homosexuality in bulgaria the country 's first gay pride parade ended in more than 60 arrests .
according to the interior ministry , bulgarian police arrested some 60 extremists who had attempted to use force to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital sofia .
a large police presence had been able to separate the several dozen parade participants from opponents from nationalist groups who threw firecrackers .
already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .
activists for more solidarity and understanding participants in the parade , which was organized by the bulgarian gay and lesbian group gemini , held a huge rainbow flag and a banner calling for " solidarity against homophobia . "
" bulgaria is in the eu now .
people have to accept us like normal human beings .
we are not criminals , " 51-year-old german engineer peter moews who lives in sofia told the afp news agency .
" hostility comes from misunderstanding .
most people think that we are all feminine and wear women dresses but this is not true , " he added .
gays and lesbians in bulgaria have faced widespread hostility since the communist era although there were no discriminatory laws or practices against them .
prime minister sergey stanishev said friday that he " accepts people with different sexual orientation but does not quite approve of the demonstrations of such an orientation .

germany captain michael ballack is doubtful for the euro 2008 final on sunday against spain .
an injury to his right calf prevented him from attending the team 's final training session . germany coach joachim loew confirmed ballack 's injury just a day before the 31-year-old midfielder was posed to lead his team against spain in the european championship in vienna .
" michael ballack has n't been able to train for two days .
his calf has hardened up , " loew told the press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack missed the final training on june 28 .
" it was n't possible for him to train today either but we will see how the situation develops overnight .
our medical team is working constantly to try to give him every possible chance of playing . "
not all hope is lost ballack has complained since friday of the problem to his right calf muscle .
" it 's not exactly the optimal situation .
yesterday -lrb- friday , june 27 -rrb- , he noticed a strain in the calf muscle .
he is now undergoing constant treatment .
we are n't giving up hope , " said team manager oliver bierhoff .
the german football federation said that a decision on whether ballack can play on sunday is still open and will be decided at short notice .
the germany captain is a key player in the team .
scouring two goals during the euro 2008 tournament , ballack was also designated the outstanding player in the 3-2 win over portugal in the quarter-finals .
ballack was less impressive against turkey in the semi-finals , but his absence would be a huge blow to the team , who are bidding for their fourth european championship title .
bildunterschrift : ballack scores the opening goal after a free kick during the austria match june 16 borowski or schweinsteiger as replacement if ballack fails to recover in time for the final match , loew said either tim borowski or bastian schweinsteiger would fill his forward midfield role .
bierhoff told the german national broadcaster ard that he expected the team to rally together to overcome the final hurdle against spain .
" the players want to take that final step , " he said .
" the team has shown determination throughout the tournament to get through the highs and lows .
the players now want to take that final step . "

the international community has called the election a farce and threatened sanctions . government sources in harare have told reporters that robert mugabe won the june 27 run-off election by a huge margin of the vote .
the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe mugabe , who has led the former british colony of zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , staged the run-off presidential election in defiance of world-wide condemnation . in a statement issued on saturday , the european commission said it " condemns in the strongest terms the organization of a run-off in zimbabwe despite repeated appeals by african and international authorities for a postponement . "
us calls for sanctions us president george w. bush was also quick to denounce the fraudulent ballot saturday and announced drawing up sanctions against the zimbabwe regime given its " blatant disregard for the zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights . " bush said he would call on the united nations to impose an arms embargo on zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials . the european union said it would not rule out sanctions against those responsible for zimbabwe 's political crisis .
the bloc is urging president robert mugabe to respect the results of the first-round presidential election held in march and won by opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party in zimbabwe it has said in a statement released saturday that the march 29 poll was the only lawful ballot held in the country this year , and may serve as a basis for an acceptable solution to crisis . in the meantime , the eu said , europe will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months , " and called the power held by zimbabwe 's current elected representatives " questionable . " in 2002 after mugabe allegedly rigged his re-election , the united states and the eu imposed sanctions against the president 's inner circle , including a travel ban and a freeze on bank accounts .
skepticism over sanction talk many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on monday that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . but african ministers expressed doubts about more sanctions , saying they will not work and that the world should focus instead on encouraging talks towards a power-sharing deal , several african officials said on saturday . " history has shown us that they -lrb- sanctions -rrb- do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , " kenyan foreign minister moses wetangula told reporters at a meeting of african foreign ministers ahead of the summit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election , which was boycotted by the first-round winner and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai after nearly 90 supporters of his movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- were killed in attacks , has been widely denounced as a sham . " a run-off election without an opponent is a farce and incapable of providing legitimacy , " frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin , a day after voters in the southern african country went to the polls . " the extent of the violence and intimidation surrounding the election yesterday reveals the depths that robert mugabe has led his country into , " he said .

the assembly has no executive authority and the election of its forty-five members in may during serbia 's general and municipal elections has been declared illegal by the un and kosovo 's majority albanian government .
kosovo 's deputy prime minister ram manaj denounced the assembly as " an attempt to create a virtual parliament which will continue to manipulate the serbs . "
growing ethnic divide the creation of a separate serb parliament in the heart of kosovo is a provocation and reflects the deepening ethnic partition since kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
in the past , kosovo serbs have protested the secession from serbia by boycotting the kosovo police force , courts and administration ; and they have burned down customs posts on the northern border with serbia .
the convening of their own parliament is another step towards cementing the ethnic divisions in what they still regard as a province of serbia .
the kosovo serbs have dubbed their parliament the assembly of the union of municipalities of the autonomous province of kosovo and drafted its mandate .
a statement read out at the session in mitrovica said the assembly would be " the representative body of the serbian republic in the autonomous province of kosovo . "
serbia 's support not certain " the serb parliament will fight against the creation of yet another albanian state in the balkans , " kosovo serb nationalist leader marko jaksic told reuters .
analysts say the assembly lacks the full backing of serbia 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- which is poised to lead a new coalition government in serbia after having defeated the nationalists .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .
this is the america europeans always regarded as the america of george bush .
now we know that this america will hardly change under a president barack obama . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .
obama 's campaign did not divulge any dates , but the trips will likely take place this summer before the race between obama and republican rival john mccain intensifies after party conventions in august and september .
visit to iraq and afghanistan obama announced earlier this month plans to visit iraq and afghanistan before the election as part of a congressional delegation , but the war-ravaged countries were not mentioned in the latest campaign statement .
such trips are usually kept secret for security reasons .
mccain , who has visited iraq eight times , has criticized obama for only visiting once .
the republican candidate , a 71-year-old vietnam war veteran who has been in congress for 26 years , has sought to paint the 46-year-old junior senator from illinois as too green to take over as america 's commander-in-chief .
obama was an early opponent of the iraq war and wants most us combat troops pulled out of the country and resources diverted to afghanistan .
mccain is a staunch supporter of the us military presence in iraq .
boosting the transatlantic alliance in europe , obama will visit the three countries that have worked closely with washington in efforts to force iran to halt uranium enrichment , which the western powers fear would be used to build a nuclear weapon .
france , germany and britain have also been close allies in the war in afghanistan , which obama argues is the real front of the " war on terror . "
" france , germany and the united kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in afghanistan , and i look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come , " obama said in his statement .
the trip , he said , " will be an important opportunity to have an exchange of views with leaders in these countries about these and other issues that are critical to american national security - and global security - in the 21st century .

" this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face , " obama said in a statement .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness . "
the saarbrücker zeitung questioned how much still unites europe with america .
" among the western democracies , the us is the only country that still applies the death penalty and allows for widespread ownership of guns .

german politicians across the political spectrum have responded with surprise and harsh criticism to comments by us presidential candidate barack obama calling for the death penalty for child rapists . despite their immense adoration and support for the democratic presidential candidate , german politicians and the media were quick to attack obama for his comments in favor of extending the death penalty for child rapists .
" the death penalty is the ultimate violation of human rights and the right to life , " green party leader claudia roth told the bild newspaper .
obama should be working for abolishing the death penalty in the united states , not for expanding it , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only five us states allow the death penalty for child rapists .
earlier in the week obama criticized a us supreme court decision declaring the execution of child rapists unconstitutional .
speaking out against the ruling , which struck down a louisiana law allowing capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , obama argued that states should have the right to consider the death penalty for such a heinous crime .
the death penalty " should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " he said .
the court had ruled 5 to 4 that applying the death penalty in such cases violated the us constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
since 1964 , the death penalty has only been applied to those convicted of murder .
world-wide abolishment of death penalty obama 's comments , which observers say were designed to counter any perception that the democratic candidate is soft on crime and bring him more in line with the views of the american middle , were harshly rejected across the political spectrum in germany , where the candidate enjoys more popularity than anywhere else in europe .
the head of the conservative , bavaria-based christian social union , erwin huber , said that although " child rape is one of the most heinous crimes , the ban on the death penalty must be absolute . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death penalty is banned in all european union member states .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the free democrats echoed that position , arguing that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide .
" the death penalty is just as inhuman as the crime of child rape , " she told the bild newspaper .
the foreign policy spokesperson for the union bloc of conservatives in the german parliament , eckart von klaeden , cautioned against upholding a false obama image in europe .
" with all the obamania in europe , many make the mistake of believing they can measure obama on european standards , " he said .
obama falls out of favor in europe german media took obama to task in several editorials over the weekend , but some also urged their readers to see obama for what he is , " a short-lived darling of the european political salon , " as the düsseldorf rheinische post described the candidate 's fall from favor .
the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel appealed to germans and europeans in general to wake up from their obamania trance and recognize the truth behind the democratic candidate 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama campaigned on the slogan " change we can believe in " " so often europeans told themselves : we are not against america only against george w. bush .
now that the left-leaning obama has removed his mask to become a president-in-waiting , many in europe are beginning to realize that the negative aspects they eagerly attributed to bush are in fact deeply embedded in the land itself : the death penalty , gun ownership , moral conservatism and a dogmatic belief in its own righteousness .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann .

at 38 , he 's reaching the end of his career and a win on sunday might be the perfect going-away party . jens lehmann says he has not yet made up his mind , but coach joachim loew may soon do that for him . lehmann , who will turn 39 in november , is reaching the end of a decade-long international career which began in february 1998 but only really took off at the 2006 world cup . sunday 's euro 2008 final against spain in vienna will be his 61st cap .
it could be his last , but just do n't expect lehmann to call it quits on the night . " i am under no pressure of time , " he said , perhaps with an eye one last major tournament at the world cup in south africa . however , former germany goalkeeper andreas koepke , now the national team 's goalkeeping coach , has said he ca n't imagine germany playing with a 40-year-old in goal .
germany is also blessed with a number of talented younger goalkeepers raring to replace the veteran between the posts . they include the uncapped 23-year-old rene adler of bayer leverkusen , a member of the euro squad , manuel neuer of schalke and michael rensing of bayern munich . the young can wait in the past , goalkeepers in germany have had to bide their time before becoming first choice in the national team , and lehmann may feel the youngsters will just have to wait a little bit longer . after all , he was 28 when he made his international debut , and was a member of the germany squad for the previous two euros and the 1998 and 2002 world cups without playing a single game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , right , with now-retired goalie oliver kahn at the 2006 world cup he appeared to be the eternal and sometimes embittered understudy , always standing in the shadow of oliver kahn , who himself was number two to koepke at euro 96 and the 1998 world cup . koepke , on the other hand , was behind 1990 world cup winner bodo illgner in the pecking order .
illgner say in an interview with saturday 's die welt that lehmann 's lack of match practice on the bench last season at arsenal is showing at euro 2008 . " after spending the second half of the season on the bench he is lacking assurance , " he said . lehmann had looked jittery in a friendly against austria earlier this year and there were some critics who said he was partly to blame for turkey 's two goals in germany 's 3-2 semi-final win . the keeper , who is now favoring a fluorescent green shirt in the hope it might distract opponents , did , however , play with command in germany 's wins over austria and portugal .

his lack of match practice last season was a constant issue for loew to address , and the keeper had considered a move back to dortmund so as not to jeopardize his euro 2008 chances . however , there has been no real threat of him experiencing predecessor kahn 's fate before the 2006 world cup when coach juergen klinsmann - with the agreement of his then assistant loew - dropped the now retired bayern munich stalwart for lehmann .

in parts of eastern europe , the gathering of gays and lesbians to protest discrimination ended in violence and arrests . on the 30th annual christopher street day , tens of thousands of gays and lesbians defied the rain to walk the streets of berlin in exotic costumes , waving rainbow flags and drawing attention to their campaign for awareness and tolerance .
the parade , which recalls the events of june 28 , 1969 , when new york gays stood up to arbitrary police intimidation , started in east berlin and made its way along the boulevard unter den linden to the victory column in west berlin .
several prominent german politicians took part in the event to celebrate diversity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 95-year-old rudolf brazda survived the nazi persecution of homosexuals in buchenwald this year 's berlin parade was dedicated to highlighting the continuing violence directed against gays and lesbians and began with a memorial tribute to the many victims of nazi persecution of homosexuals between 1933 and 1945 .
in paris , more than half a million people took part in a gay pride parade under the motto " for a school without any discrimination , " dedicated to the fight against racism , sexism and xenophobia among young people .
among the prominent participants in the parade was paris mayor bertrand delanoe and former culture minister jack lang , both members of the socialist party .
the conservative governing party ump and the centrist modem were also represented .
rightwing extremists block peaceful demonstrations in many eastern european countries , where gay pride parades were held for the first time , participants clashed with angry counter-demonstrators and police were forced to make several arrests .
at least 20 people were injured when the czech republic 's first-ever gay pride parade was attacked by rightwing extremists armed with tear gas even before the event was due to begin in the city of brno .
three people were arrested when counter-demonstrators threw fireworks at the gathering of lesbians and gays in which an estimated 500 were expected to participate .
with calls in the internet for resistance to the " queer parade , " more than 200 police were present during the planned event .
local news media reported the presence of 150 aggressive counter-demonstrators and hundreds of onlookers .
among the supporters of the parade were czech minister of human rights and minorities dzamila stehlikova and tennis legend martina navratilova .
czech same-sex unions have enjoyed official recognition since 2006 .
bulgarian nationalists protest against homosexuality in bulgaria the country 's first gay pride parade ended in more than 60 arrests .
according to the interior ministry , bulgarian police arrested some 60 extremists who had attempted to use force to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital sofia .
a large police presence had been able to separate the several dozen parade participants from opponents from nationalist groups who threw firecrackers .
already in advance of the event , security concerns had forced organizers and municipal authorities to change the parade route twice within 24 hours and to deploy a large number of police to prevent clashes .
the bulgarian nationalist union had urged people to stage an " open resistance " to the gay parade and had gathered signatures for a petition against " homosexuality and child abuse " during the parade .
the bulgarian orthodox church also protested the open demonstration of homosexuality and called the parade " a scandalous and wicked gathering . "
bulgaria 's grand mufti who speaks for the country 's muslim population issued a special statement denouncing homosexuality .
activists for more solidarity and understanding participants in the parade , which was organized by the bulgarian gay and lesbian group gemini , held a huge rainbow flag and a banner calling for " solidarity against homophobia . "
" bulgaria is in the eu now .
people have to accept us like normal human beings .
we are not criminals , " 51-year-old german engineer peter moews who lives in sofia told the afp news agency .
" hostility comes from misunderstanding .
most people think that we are all feminine and wear women dresses but this is not true , " he added .
gays and lesbians in bulgaria have faced widespread hostility since the communist era although there were no discriminatory laws or practices against them .
prime minister sergey stanishev said friday that he " accepts people with different sexual orientation but does not quite approve of the demonstrations of such an orientation .

a £ 2.7bn emergency package announced by the chancellor last month did not go far enough , the cross-party commons treasury committee said in a report .
the money had not been " well-targeted " , with £ 2bn going to middle-income workers who had not lost out , it added .
mr darling has said he wants to do more to help those not already compensated .
the committee 's report said the chancellor 's decision to raise the income tax threshold by £ 600 in may , at a cost of £ 2.7bn , was " probably the least bad option " to mitigate the impact of the abolition of the 10p rate . "
the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full " john mcfall committee chairman it found the 5.3m losers from the initial decision were people on low incomes for whom the loss of up to £ 232 a year had dealt a " significant " blow to their finances .
this , it noted , came at a time of sharply rising prices for essential goods and services .
some people were still estimated to be up to £ 112 a year worse off , the report said .
young workers the committee found most of those affected were younger workers on low incomes with no children , but the worst-hit group were women between the ages of 60 and 64 with small work pensions .
committee chairman john mcfall said : " the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full .
" the government must not let this issue slide into the background and will need to produce fresh proposals to fully compensate these 1.1m households by the time of the 2008 pre-budget report . "
the mps noted the government had yet to make clear whether the package of help given this year - funded by extra state borrowing - would be repeated in the future .
however , any new measures to help those losing out should be made through the tax system , the report suggested .
child poverty frank field , the labour backbencher who led the rebellion against the scrapping of the 10p tax rate , said the government 's compensation package was not equal to one million people 's loss .
he said : " we will be looking , when we debate this in the commons , and when the government promises it will come back in november , for a proper settlement for everyone who lost out on 10p . "
the committee called on mr darling to use his autumn pre-budget report to launch consultations on future changes to income tax , rather than keeping them secret until budget day .
" the government must now ensure that there is no backsliding and that future reforms to the tax and benefit system do not reverse this very positive development , " said mr mcfall .
the mps also warned that the immediate need to compensate those who lost out after the scrapping of the 10p tax rate should not detract from the challenge of tackling child and pensioner poverty .
the report called for the creation of a poverty commission to look at the effect of public policy on the poorest families .
the decision to scrap the 10p tax rate , made by gordon brown in his last budget as chancellor , came into force in april this year - alongside a reduction in the basic rate of tax from 22 % to 20 % .
it had threatened to provoke a backbench rebellion by labour mps .

a £ 2.7bn emergency package announced by the chancellor last month did not go far enough , the cross-party commons treasury committee said in a report .
the money had not been " well-targeted " , with £ 2bn going to middle-income workers who had not lost out , it added .
mr darling has said he wants to do more to help those not already compensated .
the committee 's report said the chancellor 's decision to raise the income tax threshold by £ 600 in may , at a cost of £ 2.7bn , was " probably the least bad option " to mitigate the impact of the abolition of the 10p rate .
the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full john mcfall committee chairman it found the 5.3m losers from the initial decision were people on low incomes for whom the loss of up to £ 232 a year had dealt a " significant " blow to their finances .
this , it noted , came at a time of sharply rising prices for essential goods and services .
some people were still estimated to be up to £ 112 a year worse off , the report said .
young workers the committee found most of those affected were younger workers on low incomes with no children , but the worst-hit group were women between the ages of 60 and 64 with small work pensions .
committee chairman john mcfall said : " the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full .
" the government must not let this issue slide into the background and will need to produce fresh proposals to fully compensate these 1.1m households by the time of the 2008 pre-budget report . "
the mps noted the government had yet to make clear whether the package of help given this year - funded by extra state borrowing - would be repeated in the future .
however , any new measures to help those losing out should be made through the tax system , the report suggested .
child poverty frank field , the labour backbencher who led the rebellion against the scrapping of the 10p tax rate , said the government 's compensation package was not equal to one million people 's loss .
he said : " we will be looking , when we debate this in the commons , and when the government promises it will come back in november , for a proper settlement for everyone who lost out on 10p . "
the committee called on mr darling to use his autumn pre-budget report to launch consultations on future changes to income tax , rather than keeping them secret until budget day .
" the government must now ensure that there is no backsliding and that future reforms to the tax and benefit system do not reverse this very positive development , " said mr mcfall .
the mps also warned that the immediate need to compensate those who lost out after the scrapping of the 10p tax rate should not detract from the challenge of tackling child and pensioner poverty .
the report called for the creation of a poverty commission to look at the effect of public policy on the poorest families .
the decision to scrap the 10p tax rate , made by gordon brown in his last budget as chancellor , came into force in april this year - alongside a reduction in the basic rate of tax from 22 % to 20 % .
it had threatened to provoke a backbench rebellion by labour mps .

a £ 2.7bn emergency package announced by the chancellor last month did not go far enough , the cross-party commons treasury committee said in a report .
the money had not been " well-targeted " , with £ 2bn going to middle-income workers who had not lost out , it added .
mr darling has said he wants to do more to help those not already compensated .
the committee 's report said the chancellor 's decision to raise the income tax threshold by £ 600 in may , at a cost of £ 2.7bn , was " probably the least bad option " to mitigate the impact of the abolition of the 10p rate .
the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full john mcfall committee chairman it found the 5.3m losers from the initial decision were people on low incomes for whom the loss of up to £ 232 a year had dealt a " significant " blow to their finances .
this , it noted , came at a time of sharply rising prices for essential goods and services .
some people were still estimated to be up to £ 112 a year worse off , the report said .
young workers the committee found most of those affected were younger workers on low incomes with no children , but the worst-hit group were women between the ages of 60 and 64 with small work pensions .
committee chairman john mcfall said : " the government 's short-term priority must be to make every effort to compensate these people in full .
" the government must not let this issue slide into the background and will need to produce fresh proposals to fully compensate these 1.1m households by the time of the 2008 pre-budget report . "
the mps noted the government had yet to make clear whether the package of help given this year - funded by extra state borrowing - would be repeated in the future .
however , any new measures to help those losing out should be made through the tax system , the report suggested .
child poverty frank field , the labour backbencher who led the rebellion against the scrapping of the 10p tax rate , said the government 's compensation package was not equal to one million people 's loss .
he said : " we will be looking , when we debate this in the commons , and when the government promises it will come back in november , for a proper settlement for everyone who lost out on 10p . "
the committee called on mr darling to use his autumn pre-budget report to launch consultations on future changes to income tax , rather than keeping them secret until budget day .
" the government must now ensure that there is no backsliding and that future reforms to the tax and benefit system do not reverse this very positive development , " said mr mcfall .
the mps also warned that the immediate need to compensate those who lost out after the scrapping of the 10p tax rate should not detract from the challenge of tackling child and pensioner poverty .
the report called for the creation of a poverty commission to look at the effect of public policy on the poorest families .
the decision to scrap the 10p tax rate , made by gordon brown in his last budget as chancellor , came into force in april this year - alongside a reduction in the basic rate of tax from 22 % to 20 % .
it had threatened to provoke a backbench rebellion by labour mps .

by richard black environment correspondent , bbc news website , santiago so it 's official - both sides want peace .
or do they ?
as the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- meeting came to a close , not everyone was convinced by the rhetoric of reason and good faith .
heard in the corridor : " we 've been down this road before " , " they 're not serious " , " it 's just a ploy to eat up time " .
iwc history is bloody with betrayal .
it will take more than an agreement to link arms and waltz off into the sunset to convince seasoned observers on both sides that anything more than a crock of frustration and heartache lies at the end of the path .
also heard in the corridor : " we have to try " , " it 's the last chance " , " anything would be better than this mess " .
difficult deal " the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling " giuseppe raaphorst , netherlands ' whaling commissioner even the keenest of those involved with the plan for pro- and anti-whaling countries to spend a year working out their differences and trying to agree some kind of compromise package acknowledge there is a great deal of ground to be covered .
" there 's no doubt there are big gaps here between those who want to kill whales and those who want to conserve them , " says new zealand 's whaling commissioner sir geoffrey palmer , whose background in international law and diplomacy is one of the reasons why the peace deal is even on the agenda .
" what we 've done is to start a process .
it may lead to a position that is better than the one we 're in , and that would be a wonderful thing . "
coming from a country where 92 % of the population opposes whaling - according to the environment ministry - sir geoffrey 's priority is to secure a deal that is in some definable way better for whales .
his government would be able to sell nothing less to its public , and the same goes for australia , the uk , the us and most of the european and latin american countries involved in the iwc the biggest prize for these governments would be to secure an end to scientific whaling - not only to close japan 's current operations in the antarctic , but also to prevent the provision ever being used again for large scale hunting .
japan insists for now that it will not agree to give it up , although some observers believe this is a negotiating tactic .
from some standpoints , japan would have little to lose and much to gain by ceding ground .
the scientific whaling programme costs government money , and earns little but international opprobrium .
anti-whaling countries would also be likely to insist on a ban in international trade in whale meat .
this would go down badly with norway and iceland , where some in the industry see japanese stomachs , rather than those of their compatriots , as the logical and profitable destination for their catch .
circular argument " for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things - they 're not going to compromise in any way " laila jusnes , high north alliance what about what the whalers would want ?
almost certainly , a lifting - however partial and nuanced - of the commercial whaling moratorium , which was agreed back in 1982 in language that suggests a temporary measure .
can the anti-whalers go that far ?
" i 'm afraid that for at least half if not a majority of the countries here present , that would be unacceptable out of principle , even if you would help the whales , " says giuseppe raaphorst , the netherlands ' whaling commissioner , who has been one of the voices in the eu seeking an accommodation .
it may be an accurate summary of the situation .
if it is , that is not going to impress leaders of the pro-hunting bloc , already dismayed at this meeting by the decision not to allow greenland 's inuit hunters to add humpback whales to their annual catch .
" i 'm afraid that we 're just walking around in circles , " says laila jusnes of the high north alliance , which represents whalers , sealers and fishermen in the arctic .
guide to the great whales " when it came down to anything of substance , like with the greenland request , we saw that for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things , they did n't mean it - the eu blocked it with help from the latin american countries and australia and new zealand - and that just showed us that they 're not going to compromise in any way . "
this version of the reasoning behind the refusal of greenland 's extra quota is , of course , starkly at odds with that given by countries voting against it .
and giuseppe raaphorst believes the eu is not duty bound to block any move that entails lifting the moratorium .
" the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling . "
seeking clarity where this will end up in a year 's time , after all the various formal and informal meetings and dialogues and workshops and email exchanges have taken place , is anyone 's guess .
even iwc chairman william hogarth , who has been driving the peace initiative , acknowledges that a year is a very short time in which to turn a snarling bear pit of suspicion into a modern , relevant environmental treaty organisation .
at times your head aches with the complexity .
so it was refreshing to see , in the lobby of the santiago hotel which has hosted this year 's meeting , an exhibition of startlingly huge photographs of whales - a humpback turning upside down , apparently frolicking ; a mother and calf ; a close-up view of a giant cetacean eye .
and then you remember - so that 's why it matters .

by richard black environment correspondent , bbc news website , santiago so it 's official - both sides want peace .
or do they ?
as the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- meeting came to a close , not everyone was convinced by the rhetoric of reason and good faith .
heard in the corridor : " we 've been down this road before " , " they 're not serious " , " it 's just a ploy to eat up time " .
iwc history is bloody with betrayal .
it will take more than an agreement to link arms and waltz off into the sunset to convince seasoned observers on both sides that anything more than a crock of frustration and heartache lies at the end of the path .
also heard in the corridor : " we have to try " , " it 's the last chance " , " anything would be better than this mess " .
difficult deal the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling giuseppe raaphorst , netherlands ' whaling commissioner even the keenest of those involved with the plan for pro- and anti-whaling countries to spend a year working out their differences and trying to agree some kind of compromise package acknowledge there is a great deal of ground to be covered .
" there 's no doubt there are big gaps here between those who want to kill whales and those who want to conserve them , " says new zealand 's whaling commissioner sir geoffrey palmer , whose background in international law and diplomacy is one of the reasons why the peace deal is even on the agenda .
" what we 've done is to start a process .
it may lead to a position that is better than the one we 're in , and that would be a wonderful thing . "
coming from a country where 92 % of the population opposes whaling - according to the environment ministry - sir geoffrey 's priority is to secure a deal that is in some definable way better for whales .
his government would be able to sell nothing less to its public , and the same goes for australia , the uk , the us and most of the european and latin american countries involved in the iwc thoughts and views on the iwc , whales and whaling in pictures the biggest prize for these governments would be to secure an end to scientific whaling - not only to close japan 's current operations in the antarctic , but also to prevent the provision ever being used again for large scale hunting .
japan insists for now that it will not agree to give it up , although some observers believe this is a negotiating tactic .
from some standpoints , japan would have little to lose and much to gain by ceding ground .
the scientific whaling programme costs government money , and earns little but international opprobrium .
anti-whaling countries would also be likely to insist on a ban in international trade in whale meat .
this would go down badly with norway and iceland , where some in the industry see japanese stomachs , rather than those of their compatriots , as the logical and profitable destination for their catch .
circular argument for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things - they 're not going to compromise in any way laila jusnes , high north alliance what about what the whalers would want ?
almost certainly , a lifting - however partial and nuanced - of the commercial whaling moratorium , which was agreed back in 1982 in language that suggests a temporary measure .
can the anti-whalers go that far ?
" i 'm afraid that for at least half if not a majority of the countries here present , that would be unacceptable out of principle , even if you would help the whales , " says giuseppe raaphorst , the netherlands ' whaling commissioner , who has been one of the voices in the eu seeking an accommodation .
it may be an accurate summary of the situation .
if it is , that is not going to impress leaders of the pro-hunting bloc , already dismayed at this meeting by the decision not to allow greenland 's inuit hunters to add humpback whales to their annual catch .
" i 'm afraid that we 're just walking around in circles , " says laila jusnes of the high north alliance , which represents whalers , sealers and fishermen in the arctic .
guide to the great whales " when it came down to anything of substance , like with the greenland request , we saw that for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things , they did n't mean it - the eu blocked it with help from the latin american countries and australia and new zealand - and that just showed us that they 're not going to compromise in any way . "
this version of the reasoning behind the refusal of greenland 's extra quota is , of course , starkly at odds with that given by countries voting against it .
and giuseppe raaphorst believes the eu is not duty bound to block any move that entails lifting the moratorium .
" the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling . "
seeking clarity where this will end up in a year 's time , after all the various formal and informal meetings and dialogues and workshops and email exchanges have taken place , is anyone 's guess .

media requires javascript to play .
even iwc chairman william hogarth , who has been driving the peace initiative , acknowledges that a year is a very short time in which to turn a snarling bear pit of suspicion into a modern , relevant environmental treaty organisation .
at times your head aches with the complexity .
so it was refreshing to see , in the lobby of the santiago hotel which has hosted this year 's meeting , an exhibition of startlingly huge photographs of whales - a humpback turning upside down , apparently frolicking ; a mother and calf ; a close-up view of a giant cetacean eye .
and then you remember - so that 's why it matters .

by richard black environment correspondent , bbc news website , santiago so it 's official - both sides want peace .
or do they ?
as the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- meeting came to a close , not everyone was convinced by the rhetoric of reason and good faith .
heard in the corridor : " we 've been down this road before " , " they 're not serious " , " it 's just a ploy to eat up time " .
iwc history is bloody with betrayal .
it will take more than an agreement to link arms and waltz off into the sunset to convince seasoned observers on both sides that anything more than a crock of frustration and heartache lies at the end of the path .
also heard in the corridor : " we have to try " , " it 's the last chance " , " anything would be better than this mess " .
difficult deal the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling giuseppe raaphorst , netherlands ' whaling commissioner even the keenest of those involved with the plan for pro- and anti-whaling countries to spend a year working out their differences and trying to agree some kind of compromise package acknowledge there is a great deal of ground to be covered .
" there 's no doubt there are big gaps here between those who want to kill whales and those who want to conserve them , " says new zealand 's whaling commissioner sir geoffrey palmer , whose background in international law and diplomacy is one of the reasons why the peace deal is even on the agenda .
" what we 've done is to start a process .
it may lead to a position that is better than the one we 're in , and that would be a wonderful thing . "
coming from a country where 92 % of the population opposes whaling - according to the environment ministry - sir geoffrey 's priority is to secure a deal that is in some definable way better for whales .
his government would be able to sell nothing less to its public , and the same goes for australia , the uk , the us and most of the european and latin american countries involved in the iwc thoughts and views on the iwc , whales and whaling in pictures the biggest prize for these governments would be to secure an end to scientific whaling - not only to close japan 's current operations in the antarctic , but also to prevent the provision ever being used again for large scale hunting .
japan insists for now that it will not agree to give it up , although some observers believe this is a negotiating tactic .
from some standpoints , japan would have little to lose and much to gain by ceding ground .
the scientific whaling programme costs government money , and earns little but international opprobrium .
anti-whaling countries would also be likely to insist on a ban in international trade in whale meat .
this would go down badly with norway and iceland , where some in the industry see japanese stomachs , rather than those of their compatriots , as the logical and profitable destination for their catch .
circular argument for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things - they 're not going to compromise in any way laila jusnes , high north alliance what about what the whalers would want ?
almost certainly , a lifting - however partial and nuanced - of the commercial whaling moratorium , which was agreed back in 1982 in language that suggests a temporary measure .
can the anti-whalers go that far ?
" i 'm afraid that for at least half if not a majority of the countries here present , that would be unacceptable out of principle , even if you would help the whales , " says giuseppe raaphorst , the netherlands ' whaling commissioner , who has been one of the voices in the eu seeking an accommodation .
it may be an accurate summary of the situation .
if it is , that is not going to impress leaders of the pro-hunting bloc , already dismayed at this meeting by the decision not to allow greenland 's inuit hunters to add humpback whales to their annual catch .
" i 'm afraid that we 're just walking around in circles , " says laila jusnes of the high north alliance , which represents whalers , sealers and fishermen in the arctic .
guide to the great whales " when it came down to anything of substance , like with the greenland request , we saw that for all the talk of respect and a different way of approaching things , they did n't mean it - the eu blocked it with help from the latin american countries and australia and new zealand - and that just showed us that they 're not going to compromise in any way . "
this version of the reasoning behind the refusal of greenland 's extra quota is , of course , starkly at odds with that given by countries voting against it .
and giuseppe raaphorst believes the eu is not duty bound to block any move that entails lifting the moratorium .
" the eu has a very clear mandate - we want to have the moratorium , or any better alternative that would stop whaling in due course , except for aboriginal whaling . "
seeking clarity where this will end up in a year 's time , after all the various formal and informal meetings and dialogues and workshops and email exchanges have taken place , is anyone 's guess .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
even iwc chairman william hogarth , who has been driving the peace initiative , acknowledges that a year is a very short time in which to turn a snarling bear pit of suspicion into a modern , relevant environmental treaty organisation .
at times your head aches with the complexity .
so it was refreshing to see , in the lobby of the santiago hotel which has hosted this year 's meeting , an exhibition of startlingly huge photographs of whales - a humpback turning upside down , apparently frolicking ; a mother and calf ; a close-up view of a giant cetacean eye .

the lawsuits come a day after the us supreme court ruled that a ban on the private possession of handguns in washington dc was unconstitutional .
the national rifle association -lrb- nra -rrb- says it wants similar bans in other states and cities overturned as well .
san francisco 's mayor says he plans to fight the nra challenge .
the nra lawsuit in san francisco challenges the city 's handgun ban in public housing ; while in chicago it challenges a ruling that makes it illegal to possess or sell handguns in the city .
" in washington dc , or in any state , whether you live in the housing projects or a high end suburb , you have the right to defend yourself and your family at home , " said chris cox , from the nra .
" these laws all deny that right . "
self-defence the nra is joined in the san francisco suit by a gay man living in a government-owned housing development who says he needs a gun to protect himself from potential hate crimes .
san francisco mayor gavin newsom said the city would " vigorously fight the nra " and said the ban was good for public safety .
" is there anyone out there who really believes that we need more guns in public housing ?
i ca n't for the life of me sit back and roll over on this .
we will absolutely defend the rights of the housing authority , " mr newsom said .
the supreme court 's ruling says that the constitution " protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia , and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self-defence within the home " .
the ruling enshrines for the first time the individual right to own guns and limits efforts to reduce their role in american life .
" the supreme court 's decision was very encouraging , but it is just a start , " nra lawyer c d michel said .

the nra lawsuit in san francisco challenges the city 's handgun ban in public housing ; while in chicago it challenges a ruling that makes it illegal to possess or sell handguns in the city .
" in washington dc , or in any state , whether you live in the housing projects or a high end suburb , you have the right to defend yourself and your family at home , " said chris cox , from the nra .
" these laws all deny that right . "
self-defence the nra is joined in the san francisco suit by a gay man living in a government-owned housing development who says he needs a gun to protect himself from potential hate crimes .
san francisco mayor gavin newsom said the city would " vigorously fight the nra " and said the ban was good for public safety .
" is there anyone out there who really believes that we need more guns in public housing ?
i ca n't for the life of me sit back and roll over on this .
we will absolutely defend the rights of the housing authority , " mr newsom said .
the supreme court 's ruling says that the constitution " protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia , and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self-defence within the home " .
the ruling enshrines for the first time the individual right to own guns and limits efforts to reduce their role in american life .
" the supreme court 's decision was very encouraging , but it is just a start , " nra lawyer c d michel said .
