1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 01.11.2008 eastern europe 's leaders meet to debate stance on russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's saakashvili is the main draw on his first visit to the baltics since the war relations with russia are likely to be the focus when a group of former presidents , prime ministers and other regional leaders descend on the latvian capital of riga for a nato-sponsored conference . topping the bill for the two-day meeting , which begins saturday , nov.1 , will be georgian president mikhail saakashvili , on his first visit to the baltic region since his country went to war with russia in august .
baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option .

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company is looking optimistically at the potential of zero-emission bikes because many cities in the world are imposing bans or high taxation on polluting vehicles . bicycles with an electric-power back-up are gaining in popularity , especially in flat countries such as the netherlands .
but companies are seeing more potential in high-powered electric motor bikes . police in the scottish city of edinburgh have just bought their first vectrix maxi-scooter with fleet manager dignan mcculloch , saying that " organizations across the country are focusing on improving their carbon footprint .
the implementation of the vectrix , as a direct replacement for a car , is a substantial achievement and goes a long way in helping us to reduce our carbon output . " the catch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be history ?
at present , the vectrix battery pack is a nickel metal-hydride unit , which can be recharged in two hours from a normal electric socket , giving it a range of 109 kilometers -lrb- 67.7 miles -rrb- based on urban driving at 40 km / h -lrb- 25 mph -rrb- .
the top speed is listed at 100 km / h . but one big stumbling block is the sales price at 10,000 euros in europe and $ 11,000 in the united states .
a replacement battery costs about 2,232 euros . the company has announced that it is looking at introducing lithium-ion battery technology for new models , and is also experimenting with fuel-cells .
the high cost however has to be weighed up against the drive to the petrol filling station , oil and maintenance that falls away with the electric scooter .
insurance and tax are also lower for zero-emission vehicles . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" komu is often described as a champion of the underdog with his sculptures and paintings questioning what people hide behind the masks of their faces .
he employs a dozen workers in mumbai who all come from the village where he used to live . " it is interesting to introduce traditional craft into my work .
such craft used to be used only for decorative or luxurious purposes , whereas i use it in an entirely different context , " komu said . berlin contemporary art fair kicks off the director of the 2008 berlin art forum is sabrina van der ley , who shortly will become curator of contemporary art at the kunsthalle -lrb- art hall -rrb- in hamburg .

" i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .
he added that the minister had either known about the bonus plan longer than he had admitted , or had failed to take proper charge of the listing that had been planned for oct .
27 . minister : would have fought bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition parties want a stop put to the bahn 's ipo tiefensee said he did n't know about the bonus payments until mid-september , long after he could do anything to change the scheme von randow had approved . " the personnel committee decided in june , and if i had found out about it earlier i would have opposed the bonuses , " he told the bild . the listing of europe 's biggest rail firm , which market analysts initially thought might raise up to 8 billion euros , was put on hold earlier this month due to market volatility .
experts recently estimated that a stock launch under current conditions would bring the bahn between 3 billion euros and 5 billion euros . earlier on friday , the company reported that revenues and profits rose by around 10 percent over the first nine months .

the gathering , scheduled for mid-november , could take place in early january , he said . one of the sticking points is apparently where the new organization will have its headquarters .

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" understanding is always the best answer .

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 01.11.2008 german minister appeals to bahn 's sense of fairness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee is under growing pressure to give up his post amid calls for his resignation , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee asked deutsche bahn executives to refuse millions in bonus payments planned to be paid upon the rail company 's ipo . " i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ?

" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "

however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .
he added that the minister had either known about the bonus plan longer than he had admitted , or had failed to take proper charge of the listing that had been planned for oct .
27 . minister : would have fought bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition parties want a stop put to the bahn 's ipo tiefensee said he did n't know about the bonus payments until mid-september , long after he could do anything to change the scheme von randow had approved . " the personnel committee decided in june , and if i had found out about it earlier i would have opposed the bonuses , " he told the bild . the listing of europe 's biggest rail firm , which market analysts initially thought might raise up to 8 billion euros , was put on hold earlier this month due to market volatility .
experts recently estimated that a stock launch under current conditions would bring the bahn between 3 billion euros and 5 billion euros . earlier on friday , the company reported that revenues and profits rose by around 10 percent over the first nine months .

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes .

european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .

" adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .

"
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .

he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .

exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .

the gathering , scheduled for mid-november , could take place in early january , he said . one of the sticking points is apparently where the new organization will have its headquarters .
moscow and the qatar capital of doha are among the favorites , die welt reported . the gas exporting countries forum last met in doha in april 2007 .

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering , scheduled for mid-november , could take place in early january , he said . one of the sticking points is apparently where the new organization will have its headquarters .
moscow and the qatar capital of doha are among the favorites , die welt reported . the gas exporting countries forum last met in doha in april 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 01.11.2008 german minister appeals to bahn 's sense of fairness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee is under growing pressure to give up his post amid calls for his resignation , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee asked deutsche bahn executives to refuse millions in bonus payments planned to be paid upon the rail company 's ipo . " i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .
he added that the minister had either known about the bonus plan longer than he had admitted , or had failed to take proper charge of the listing that had been planned for oct .
27 . minister : would have fought bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition parties want a stop put to the bahn 's ipo tiefensee said he did n't know about the bonus payments until mid-september , long after he could do anything to change the scheme von randow had approved . " the personnel committee decided in june , and if i had found out about it earlier i would have opposed the bonuses , " he told the bild . the listing of europe 's biggest rail firm , which market analysts initially thought might raise up to 8 billion euros , was put on hold earlier this month due to market volatility .
experts recently estimated that a stock launch under current conditions would bring the bahn between 3 billion euros and 5 billion euros . earlier on friday , the company reported that revenues and profits rose by around 10 percent over the first nine months .
deutsche bahn also said by the end of september , it had cut its debt by 1 billion euros to 15.5 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .
he added that the minister had either known about the bonus plan longer than he had admitted , or had failed to take proper charge of the listing that had been planned for oct .
27 . minister : would have fought bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition parties want a stop put to the bahn 's ipo tiefensee said he did n't know about the bonus payments until mid-september , long after he could do anything to change the scheme von randow had approved . " the personnel committee decided in june , and if i had found out about it earlier i would have opposed the bonuses , " he told the bild . the listing of europe 's biggest rail firm , which market analysts initially thought might raise up to 8 billion euros , was put on hold earlier this month due to market volatility .
experts recently estimated that a stock launch under current conditions would bring the bahn between 3 billion euros and 5 billion euros . earlier on friday , the company reported that revenues and profits rose by around 10 percent over the first nine months .
deutsche bahn also said by the end of september , it had cut its debt by 1 billion euros to 15.5 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has been the first to feel the pain of the financial crisis fears of a recession in germany are mounting after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously .
new measures to stimulate the economy include transport infrastructure projects , the extension of a program to restore old buildings and tax incentives to buy environment-friendly new cars .
peter struck , the parliamentary leader for the social democrats , who share a governing coalition with merkel ’ s christian democrats , said last week that the new package could be worth 20-25 billion euros over the next two years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i call on the directors of the bahn to decline the bonus , " he told the mass-market daily bild on saturday , nov .
1 .
" understanding is always the best answer . " the minister also added that german equity law prevents him from dictating how the company chooses to compensate its executives . tiefensee has come under increasing criticism this week when it was made public that deutsche bahn managers would receive hundreds of thousands of euros in bonus payments even if the company 's much-disputed stock launch did n't earn as much as expected .
the ipo has been postponed due to market turmoil . touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has arisen in germany over how much managers should earn public outcry over the issue led tiefensee 's deputy , matthias von randow , to lose his job this week .
von randow knew how much the bahn planned to spend in bonus payments but did n't inform tiefensee . deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn stood to gain up to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- for the market listing , and other board members could also reap millions , depending on its success , according to a report in the daily sueddeutsche zeitung . excessive executive pay has become a sensitive subject during the global financial crisis and many european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel , have called for restraint . merkel 's chief spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , backed tiefensee saying he enjoyed the chancellor 's full confidence .
opposition politicians , meanwhile , called for tiefensee 's resignation . " tiefensee must resign , " fritz kuhn , the greens party parliamentary leader , said in a statement .
he added that the minister had either known about the bonus plan longer than he had admitted , or had failed to take proper charge of the listing that had been planned for oct .
27 . minister : would have fought bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition parties want a stop put to the bahn 's ipo tiefensee said he did n't know about the bonus payments until mid-september , long after he could do anything to change the scheme von randow had approved . " the personnel committee decided in june , and if i had found out about it earlier i would have opposed the bonuses , " he told the bild . the listing of europe 's biggest rail firm , which market analysts initially thought might raise up to 8 billion euros , was put on hold earlier this month due to market volatility .
experts recently estimated that a stock launch under current conditions would bring the bahn between 3 billion euros and 5 billion euros . earlier on friday , the company reported that revenues and profits rose by around 10 percent over the first nine months .
deutsche bahn also said by the end of september , it had cut its debt by 1 billion euros to 15.5 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering , scheduled for mid-november , could take place in early january , he said . one of the sticking points is apparently where the new organization will have its headquarters .
moscow and the qatar capital of doha are among the favorites , die welt reported . the gas exporting countries forum last met in doha in april 2007 .

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .

" adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "

"
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .

he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .

a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

"
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt .

according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .
the georgian leader , who monday dismissed his prime minister and named the country 's ambassador to turkey as a replacement , said the new premier grigol mgaloblishvili had " full autonomy " to form his government . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baltic and central european nations gave saakashvili strong backing during that war and will be heavily represented at the conference .
saakashvili will appear with latvian president valdis zatlers , estonian president toomas hendrik ilves and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko during a debate titled " a vision of europe , whole and free . "
lithuanian president valdas adamkus was originally scheduled to attend , but opted to stay home as he is playing a vital role in forming a new government following recent elections .
adamkus did , however , contribute a statement which will surely prompt debate over the weekend when he said that russia 's failure to fully respect the eu-brokered ceasefire in its war with georgia was a humiliation for the european union . lithuanian president talks of eu humiliation " not all the efforts of president sarkozy to guarantee georgia 's territorial integrity have been implemented , " adamkus told reporters friday .
" this is a humiliation for the entire european union , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamkus said russia had humiliated the eu in august french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu , brokered a cease-fire with his russian opposite number dmitry medvedev to end moscow 's brief war with its neighbor georgia . lithuania , like georgia , was part of the soviet union until the communist bloc collapsed in 1991 . the baltic state is now firmly anchored in the west , having joined the eu and nato in 2004 , and is a vocal supporter of georgia 's drive to become part of the club . the issue of georgia is due to be discussed at a summit next month between the leaders of the eu and russia . there , adamkus said , lithuania would " ask a question of principle : are there values for which european union 's members stand united , and which must be respected ? " adamkus pledged to " draw the attention of the heads of state to the current situation and spotlight the dangers threatening europe . " the georgia conflict left the eu deeply split , with some western member states anxious not to anger russia with a tough stance , and others , notably ex-soviet republics such as lithuania , seeking a hard line . eu members eventually agreed to suspend talks launched in july with russia on a new pact to reinforce ties between the bloc and the resurgent energy giant . lithuania earlier this week sharply criticized a proposal by french foreign minister bernard kouchner to unfreeze these negotiations at next month 's eu-russia summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five days of violence engulfed parts of georgia in august russia moved into georgia on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia . the breakaway region 's administration had long enjoyed extensive support from moscow and its troops , stationed there as peacekeepers since the soviet union fell apart . russian forces have left the buffer zones they seized in georgia and pulled back into south ossetia and fellow-separatist abkhazia , under the terms of the cease-fire agreement . but lithuania argues that moscow was also meant to reduce troop numbers within both regions , which moscow has recognized as independent states , and to give free international observers unfettered access . on tuesday , a lithuania official said russian troop numbers had risen and pointed out that observers had not been allowed into the separatist regions . adamkus , ilves and yushchenko , along with latvian prime minister ivars godmanis and polish president lech kaczynski , went to tbilisi in august in a show of solidarity with a fellow former communist state .
they also signed a declaration condemning what they called russia 's " military aggression . "
a summit heavy with symbolism bildunterschrift : from left : estonia 's president ilves , poland 's president kaczynski , georgia 's president saakashvili , lithuania 's president adamkus and latvian prime minister godmanis before the closing debate on sunday , a range of other topics will be discussed in riga 's historic house of blackheads including one provocatively titled : " russia - no business as usual ? "
the medieval house of blackheads was itself demolished by the red army after the end of world war ii and rebuilt in a highly symbolic act as soon as latvia regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
however , despite the preoccupation with russia in debates on defense and " military threats emanating in the nearest neighborhood " the most senior russian attendee will be boris nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister of russia and now chairman of the russian union of oil exporters .
saakashvili arrives in latvia after holding talks with scandinavian leaders this week on tbilisi 's aim of joining nato in future .
the georgian leader held talks norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg to discuss developing energy cooperation and norwegian support for various reform programs before moving onto sweden .
saakashvili continues lobbying for nato membership concerning georgia 's prospects of joining nato , stoltenberg said " the door is open , " citing the decision taken by nato leaders at a summit in bucharest in april .
" what we are discussing is the timetable , the development and reforms that are needed in georgia , " stoltenberg said , adding that nato and georgia were in " close dialogue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer keeps the door open for georgia at the bucharest summit , some nato members supported early membership , while others wanted a slower approach , deferring a decision on a membership action plan until december .
touching on the brief war with russia in august , saakashvili said it " might not have happened if not for this ambiguous message from bucharest . "
he repeated his view that the war was a " clear cut case of aggression " similar to what happened in europe during the 1930s .
saakashavili said georgia had " nothing to hide " when asked about recent allegations that war crimes were committed by georgian forces during the war including in the separatist region of south ossetia .
stoltenberg said he welcomed saakashavili 's readiness to allow an investigation and " transparency " into the august events .

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people .

" komu is often described as a champion of the underdog with his sculptures and paintings questioning what people hide behind the masks of their faces .
he employs a dozen workers in mumbai who all come from the village where he used to live . " it is interesting to introduce traditional craft into my work .
such craft used to be used only for decorative or luxurious purposes , whereas i use it in an entirely different context , " komu said . berlin contemporary art fair kicks off the director of the 2008 berlin art forum is sabrina van der ley , who shortly will become curator of contemporary art at the kunsthalle -lrb- art hall -rrb- in hamburg . " since the art forum began in berlin in 1996 it 's grown into the biggest art fair in germany , which was what everybody was hoping for , " she told dpa .

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package .

some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .

" the government reacted quickly and decisively to the international financial markets crisis with a comprehensive stabilization package , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" now our banks and financial institutions need to utilize this package . " german banks slow to ask for help the bailout plan approved last month by merkel 's government includes terms on the money including a likely salary cap of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 637,000 -rrb- for managers at banks that participate .
some officials have however suggested that those caps might be watered down . but german banks have been slow to line up for the government bailout amid fears of stigmatization , punishment by the stock markets and stringent conditions imposed by the government . there have been growing calls in germany over the past week for the banks to take advantage of the aid being offered .
some have even suggested they should be forced to accept recapitalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's lifeline for banks has had few takers so far german news magazine der spiegel reported that the government would force banks to tap the rescue package , much like in britain , if they did not voluntarily apply for help . a spokesman at the german finance ministry however said there was no reason to do that yet . public-sector bank bayernlb was the first to take advantage of the bailout , when officials there said last week it was seeking 5.4 billion euros from the fund . on wednesday , commercial property lender hypo real estate ag became the first private institution to participate when it requested a 15 billion euro credit line , meant to guarantee its short-term lending activity until it receives a larger bailout in a few weeks . the government had previously agreed to prop up hypo in a separate plan worth up to 50 billion euros . on friday , media reports said commerzbank , germany 's second-largest private bank is interested in a capital injection under the government 's emergency bailout scheme .
news agency reuters , quoted unnamed sources saying it could lead to germany taking a stake in commerzbank .
exposure to investments in iceland as well as to collapsed wall street investment bank lehman brothers are compounding commerzbank 's difficulties , reuters said . new measures to boost economy merkel also said in the podcast that her cabinet would approve a second package of intervention measures next week to bolster the weakening economy .
" we know that the international financial markets crisis will also have an impact on our economy , " she said .
" however , we want the impact on our economy to be limited . "

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to push diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a humanitarian disaster in dr congo .
but the use of military force has to remain an option , a british official said . french foreign minister bernard kouchner and british foreign secretary david miliband held crisis talks saturday with democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila in a diplomatic push to halt a rebel advance and looming humanitarian disaster in the east of the country . " the key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made , " miliband said after the meeting .
" around the world , people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it 's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings . " the pair of european diplomats is scheduled to visit the rwanda on saturday , while the top us envoy for africa , jendayi frazer , was also in the dr congo . " we will try in kinshasa , in goma and in kigali to renew contacts , which have never been completely severed , and to establish first perhaps a calming down , which then could lead us towards peace negotiations , " kouchner told europe 1 radio before leaving for africa . kouchner went on to call the violence " a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes . " west focuses on diplomatic answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said the eu can not simply watch as violence continues the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with congolese and rwandan presidents joseph kabila and paul kagame , told the bbc that the leaders had agreed to meet at a summit , possibly in nairobi , kenya , involving the african union and other african leaders . western diplomats feel that the only way to resolve the conflict is to bring rwanda and the dr congo together at the table .
european union leaders said they would focus on a diplomatic solution to the current unrest but added that a military mission must remain a final option . " we have certainly got to have it as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it , " mark malloch-brown , britain 's junior foreign minister , told the bbc .
" if everything else fails we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . " fighting raged for four days and un peacekeepers joined the battle , pounding rebel tutsi general laurent nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- with helicopter gunships . cease-fire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's envoy has called for more troops un peacekeepers were , however , stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday called the situation " very threatening " and urged nkunda to stick to the cease-fire , which nkunda declared wednesday with his troops on the verge of taking the major city goma . the cease-fire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . aid groups leave drc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people have already left their homes the situation in goma is volatile , with congolese troops who fled the rebel advance seemingly out of control .
there have been repeated reports that soldiers are killing , raping and looting in goma . many aid agencies evacuated their staff from goma on wednesday as the rebels approached , but some now plan to take advantage of the cease-fire to return .
the un refugee agency unhcr said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people . " we are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the unhcr-administered sites of dumez , nyongera and kasasa , " spokesman ron redmond told journalists . other aid workers said friday that some displaced people were attempting to leave goma and return to their home villages . dr congo has accused rwanda of backing nkunda and there were some reports of cross-border firing during the fighting .
nkunda says he is fighting to protect tutsis from armed hutu groups . many hutus fled to congo after the 1994 massacres in rwanda when hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in the space of a few months . the un said about 250,000 civilians have fled the fighting since august , bringing the number of refugees in north kivu to almost 1 million . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokesman tim bonner said the law " fails at every possible level " and things were looking " very positive " for those who wanted to see it overturned .
about 50,000 people are expected to take part in 300 hunts across the uk later on the opening day of the season .
the hunt saboteurs association said " the level of violence from hunts and supporters remains undiminished " .
its members have vowed to carry on their fight to block hunts wherever possible .
managing mammals under the hunting act , introduced in 2005 , dogs can still be used to follow a scent or flush a fox out of cover , but can not be used to kill it .
the act also allows the hunting of other animals such as rabbits and rats , and states that the law has not been broken if a fox is killed unintentionally .
the hsa says some hunts are using " loopholes " like these to carry on as if the law had never been passed .
mr bonner said there was a very strong determination among hunt supporters to keep going .
the general public seem to be fed up with the outrageous arrogance and attitude of the hunters lee moon hunt saboteurs association " the politics of hunting are certainly not dead , " he said .
" in fact , it 's looking very positive indeed as far as the possible repeal of the hunting act is concerned .
" certainly , we need to look at legislation about how mammals are managed in the wild in a consistent and holistic way , but this law has nothing going for it whatsoever .
" it fails at every possible level and we think the only answer is to get rid of it completely . "
the hsa says some hunts do obey the rules , but others are showing " a blatant disregard for the law of the land " .
the police and criminal justice bodies " do not appear to be too interested , " it adds .
lee moon , from the hsa , said : " many -lsb- saboteurs -rsb- are witnessing not only hunting as usual , but also that the level of violence from hunts and supporters remains undiminished . "

spokesman tim bonner said the law " fails at every possible level " and things were looking " very positive " for those who wanted to see it overturned .

managing mammals under the hunting act , introduced in 2005 , dogs can still be used to follow a scent or flush a fox out of cover , but can not be used to kill it .
the act also allows the hunting of other animals such as rabbits and rats , and states that the law has not been broken if a fox is killed unintentionally .
the hsa says some hunts are using " loopholes " like these to carry on as if the law had never been passed .
mr bonner said there was a very strong determination among hunt supporters to keep going .
the general public seem to be fed up with the outrageous arrogance and attitude of the hunters lee moon hunt saboteurs association " the politics of hunting are certainly not dead , " he said .
" in fact , it 's looking very positive indeed as far as the possible repeal of the hunting act is concerned .
" certainly , we need to look at legislation about how mammals are managed in the wild in a consistent and holistic way , but this law has nothing going for it whatsoever .
" it fails at every possible level and we think the only answer is to get rid of it completely . "
the hsa says some hunts do obey the rules , but others are showing " a blatant disregard for the law of the land " .
the police and criminal justice bodies " do not appear to be too interested , " it adds .

spokesman tim bonner said the law " fails at every possible level " and things were looking " very positive " for those who wanted to see it overturned .
about 50,000 people are expected to take part in 300 hunts across the uk later on the opening day of the season .

the act also allows the hunting of other animals such as rabbits and rats , and states that the law has not been broken if a fox is killed unintentionally .
the hsa says some hunts are using " loopholes " like these to carry on as if the law had never been passed .
mr bonner said there was a very strong determination among hunt supporters to keep going .
the general public seem to be fed up with the outrageous arrogance and attitude of the hunters lee moon hunt saboteurs association " the politics of hunting are certainly not dead , " he said .
" in fact , it 's looking very positive indeed as far as the possible repeal of the hunting act is concerned .

" it fails at every possible level and we think the only answer is to get rid of it completely . "

spokesman tim bonner said the law " fails at every possible level " and things were looking " very positive " for those who wanted to see it overturned .
about 50,000 people are expected to take part in 300 hunts across the uk later on the opening day of the season .
the hunt saboteurs association said " the level of violence from hunts and supporters remains undiminished " .
its members have vowed to carry on their fight to block hunts wherever possible .
managing mammals under the hunting act , introduced in 2005 , dogs can still be used to follow a scent or flush a fox out of cover , but can not be used to kill it .
the act also allows the hunting of other animals such as rabbits and rats , and states that the law has not been broken if a fox is killed unintentionally .
the hsa says some hunts are using " loopholes " like these to carry on as if the law had never been passed .
mr bonner said there was a very strong determination among hunt supporters to keep going .
the general public seem to be fed up with the outrageous arrogance and attitude of the hunters lee moon hunt saboteurs association " the politics of hunting are certainly not dead , " he said .
" in fact , it 's looking very positive indeed as far as the possible repeal of the hunting act is concerned .
" certainly , we need to look at legislation about how mammals are managed in the wild in a consistent and holistic way , but this law has nothing going for it whatsoever .
" it fails at every possible level and we think the only answer is to get rid of it completely . "
the hsa says some hunts do obey the rules , but others are showing " a blatant disregard for the law of the land " .
the police and criminal justice bodies " do not appear to be too interested , " it adds .

research published in the british journal of psychiatry links excessive drinking and a loss of brain tissue .
dr susham gupta and dr james warner said people were drinking almost double what they were in the 1960s and claimed cheaper alcohol could be a cause .
they said the problem might only be curbed by introducing tough laws .
binge drinking is associated with a higher risk of dementia .
alcohol is said to account for around a tenth of all cases , while heavy drinking to believed to contribute to almost a quarter .
the report writers pointed out the price of alcohol relative to average uk income had halved since the 1960s . "
as drinking habits change , it is vital we understand more about the relationship between alcohol and this devastating condition " dr susanne sorensen alzheimer 's society between the early part of that decade and 2000 , consumption of pure alcohol per head was said to have nearly doubled from less than six litres a year to more than 11.5 litres .
the pair said that if trends continued , within 10 years the uk population would be drinking more alcohol than any other country in europe .
they wrote : " given the neurotoxic effects of alcohol and the inexorable increase in per capita consumption , future generations may see a disproportionate increase in alcohol-related dementia . "
' brain damage ' they said although " moderate drinking " was associated with health benefits , binge-drinking was potentially " highly destructive " .
at high intake levels , the benefits of alcohol were reversed leading to high blood pressure , raised levels of harmful blood fats , and brain damage .
they admitted any " public health initiatives " warning people about the risk could be " unpopular and ineffective " but felt legislation could be an option .
the issue was also discussed in september by psychiatrists at a conference hosted by dementia services development centre at the university of stirling .
dr susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said that one in three people over 65 died with dementia .
she said : " binge drinkers hitting the town on a saturday night are becoming a familiar sight , but we do n't yet understand how it will affect the numbers of people with dementia . "
she said previous research had focused on alcoholics who had an increased risk of dementia because they did not eat enough for long time-periods .
she said : " in contrast , binge drinkers drink heavily at certain times but may still eat well and therefore do not have the same type of risk .

research published in the british journal of psychiatry links excessive drinking and a loss of brain tissue .
dr susham gupta and dr james warner said people were drinking almost double what they were in the 1960s and claimed cheaper alcohol could be a cause .
they said the problem might only be curbed by introducing tough laws .
binge drinking is associated with a higher risk of dementia .
alcohol is said to account for around a tenth of all cases , while heavy drinking to believed to contribute to almost a quarter .
the report writers pointed out the price of alcohol relative to average uk income had halved since the 1960s .
as drinking habits change , it is vital we understand more about the relationship between alcohol and this devastating condition dr susanne sorensen alzheimer 's society between the early part of that decade and 2000 , consumption of pure alcohol per head was said to have nearly doubled from less than six litres a year to more than 11.5 litres .
the pair said that if trends continued , within 10 years the uk population would be drinking more alcohol than any other country in europe .
they wrote : " given the neurotoxic effects of alcohol and the inexorable increase in per capita consumption , future generations may see a disproportionate increase in alcohol-related dementia . "
' brain damage ' they said although " moderate drinking " was associated with health benefits , binge-drinking was potentially " highly destructive " .
at high intake levels , the benefits of alcohol were reversed leading to high blood pressure , raised levels of harmful blood fats , and brain damage .
they admitted any " public health initiatives " warning people about the risk could be " unpopular and ineffective " but felt legislation could be an option .
the issue was also discussed in september by psychiatrists at a conference hosted by dementia services development centre at the university of stirling .
dr susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said that one in three people over 65 died with dementia .
she said : " binge drinkers hitting the town on a saturday night are becoming a familiar sight , but we do n't yet understand how it will affect the numbers of people with dementia . "
