" some of you will be surprised , " said antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , which compiled the report , at a news conference in brussels .
" in general , if you look at conventional crime , the levels of these crimes across the region are by far lower than they used to be , particularly at the beginning of the 1990s . "
the un report says that the levels of conventional crime are now lower in the balkans than in western europe .
no longer gangsters ' paradise called " crime and its impact on the balkans , " the report is based on un and national police data from nine countries : serbia , albania , macedonia , croatia , romania , moldova , bulgaria , montenegro and bosnia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murders have dropped in the balkans since the 1990s underlining the benefits of the relative political and economic stability of recent years in the region , the report said the balkans had come a long way from a time when " demagogues , secret police and thugs profited from sanctions-busting and the smuggling of people , arms , cigarettes and drugs . "
" at present , the levels of crime against people and property are lower than elsewhere in europe , and the number of murders is falling in every balkan country , " costa said .
the number of reported murders in the region halved from 2,185 in 1998 to 1,130 in 2006 , the report found .
the report says the trend of reduced crime will continue since the region did not have the basic conditions for high levels of crime that exist elsewhere : mass poverty , income inequality , large-scale urbanization and youth unemployment .
" the stereotype of the balkans as a gangsters ' paradise no longer applies - though serious problems remain , " costa said .
organized crime , heroin smuggling main problems organized crime and the region 's role in heroin trafficking risk undermining the successes achieved in slashing conventional crime , the unodc report suggests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the heroin destined for europe passes through the balkans costa said there were widespread links between business , politics and organized crime , in particular in albania , which he said remains the " soft underbelly " of the balkans for organized crime .
" what we see as the big problem in albania is in a certain sense corruption and a benign eye in turn towards organized crime . "
heroin smuggling also remains a huge problem with the balkans considered the main transit route for heroin destined for western europe .
about 100 tons are estimated to pass through the region every year , costa said .
the eu too has long been concerned about organized crime and corruption in the balkans , both in new eu member states romania and bulgaria , as well others involved in the eu 's extensive accession process which makes legal , political and other reforms conditions for eu entry .
" formidable challenges " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said on thursday tackling organized crime and corruption remained " formidable challenges " in the balkans .
" this needs to change if the region is to keep moving forward towards the european union , " he said , adding that those threats remained the greatest obstacles to visa-free travel to the eu for balkan citizens .
" the fact is that eu states and public opinion are worried about organized crime in the balkans , " rehn said .
the un report has urged governments in the balkans to clean up the nexus between criminal gangs and business .
it has also called for more cross-border cooperation between national police forces .
" profiteers of the past are trying to launder their reputations and money through business and politics , " said costa .
" future crime trends in the balkans will depend on the rule of law , integrity in governance and political ability . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .
unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has climbed to record highs recently but whether weak against the dollar , as in 2000 , or strong today , the single currency has failed to win over millions of those who use it daily .
a recent poll found one third of germans would like to go back to deutschmarks .
more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .
temptation has been strong to blame the ecb , which has sole responsibility for the euro , a measure designed to thwart meddling from more than a dozen governments with varied economic and monetary agendas . afp / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .

more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 30.05.2008 german parliament clears way for rail privatization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privatization advocates say the move will benefit rail passengers the german parliament gave the green light on friday for the partial privatization of deutsche bahn ag by agreeing to a controversial plan to sell off shares in europe 's biggest rail group . chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition on friday , may 30 , approved a proposal in parliament to allow private investors to buy up to 24.9 percent of deutsche bahn 's passenger and logistics operations with deutsche bahn expected to make its stock market debut later this year .
the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 30.05.2008 putting a fresh face on germany 's cigarette industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz -lrb- center -rrb- will be confronted with posters like this one in the future as the world marks no tobacco day on may 31 , dw-world.de takes a look at germany 's cigarette industry , whose new head lobbyist wants to make her work transparent .
a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.05.2008 putin feted as head of state on visit to france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's trip suggested he 's the one calling the foreign policy shots russian pm putin discussed eu-russia relations during a two-day visit to france , his first trip abroad since stepping down as head of state .
his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "

ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .
iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said we " kept our commitments " and in remarks during the conference and at the concluding news conference repeated the need for other governments to " forgive debts " and lift sanctions that were imposed after wars waged by the regime of saddam hussein .
he welcomed a statement that neighboring saudi arabia was willing to write off some of its claims , adding that " more information " was needed .
iraqi debt debt relief was also mentioned by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who said the us " would encourage other countries " to write off their debts like bulgaria , serbia , bosnia , slovenia and russia had since the ici process was launched a year ago .
the international monetary fund has estimated that iraq in 2007-2008 settled $ 23 billion dollars of its $ 75 billion -lrb- 48 million-euro -rrb- external debt burden .
" stability in iraq is stability for the region , and any instability in iraq will affect the region as a whole , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters on the sidelines , adding that iran was cooperating with iraq on energy and other areas .
on opening the conference , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt underlined the importance that neighboring countries have had in hosting the flow of refugees from iraq and cited the need to let " the un take the lead in our engagement with iraq .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is set to leave berlin on saturday for a mideast tour , told the bundestag parliament that germany 's responsibility towards israel meant it had to " take a stand against the iranian president 's talk time and again . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has faced international criticism for saying israel should be " wiped off the map " and questioning whether the nazi holocaust , in which 6 million jews were killed , actually took place .
" the immeasurable pain germans inflicted on germans and other europeans of jewish faith is part of our history , " steinmeier said .
" action for the future derives from responsibility for the past , " he said .
painful compromises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful solution in the middle east continues to pose numerous challanges steinmeier warned that the " two-state " solution required painful compromises from palestinians and israelis .
he said both sides needed resoluteness and far-sightedness .
germany and the european union could help with the background conditions .
the minister said he saw a little blue in the " middle east sky " with lebanon 's domestic political crisis over , adding that perhaps the conditions were now in place for reconstruction in lebanon .
he welcomed the turkish-mediated indirect talks between israel and syria .
german-israeli relations would always be a special case , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some of you will be surprised , " said antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , which compiled the report , at a news conference in brussels .
" in general , if you look at conventional crime , the levels of these crimes across the region are by far lower than they used to be , particularly at the beginning of the 1990s . "
the un report says that the levels of conventional crime are now lower in the balkans than in western europe .
no longer gangsters ' paradise called " crime and its impact on the balkans , " the report is based on un and national police data from nine countries : serbia , albania , macedonia , croatia , romania , moldova , bulgaria , montenegro and bosnia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murders have dropped in the balkans since the 1990s underlining the benefits of the relative political and economic stability of recent years in the region , the report said the balkans had come a long way from a time when " demagogues , secret police and thugs profited from sanctions-busting and the smuggling of people , arms , cigarettes and drugs . "
" at present , the levels of crime against people and property are lower than elsewhere in europe , and the number of murders is falling in every balkan country , " costa said .
the number of reported murders in the region halved from 2,185 in 1998 to 1,130 in 2006 , the report found .
the report says the trend of reduced crime will continue since the region did not have the basic conditions for high levels of crime that exist elsewhere : mass poverty , income inequality , large-scale urbanization and youth unemployment .
" the stereotype of the balkans as a gangsters ' paradise no longer applies - though serious problems remain , " costa said .
organized crime , heroin smuggling main problems organized crime and the region 's role in heroin trafficking risk undermining the successes achieved in slashing conventional crime , the unodc report suggests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the heroin destined for europe passes through the balkans costa said there were widespread links between business , politics and organized crime , in particular in albania , which he said remains the " soft underbelly " of the balkans for organized crime .
" what we see as the big problem in albania is in a certain sense corruption and a benign eye in turn towards organized crime . "
heroin smuggling also remains a huge problem with the balkans considered the main transit route for heroin destined for western europe .
about 100 tons are estimated to pass through the region every year , costa said .
the eu too has long been concerned about organized crime and corruption in the balkans , both in new eu member states romania and bulgaria , as well others involved in the eu 's extensive accession process which makes legal , political and other reforms conditions for eu entry .
" formidable challenges " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said on thursday tackling organized crime and corruption remained " formidable challenges " in the balkans .
" this needs to change if the region is to keep moving forward towards the european union , " he said , adding that those threats remained the greatest obstacles to visa-free travel to the eu for balkan citizens .
" the fact is that eu states and public opinion are worried about organized crime in the balkans , " rehn said .
the un report has urged governments in the balkans to clean up the nexus between criminal gangs and business .
it has also called for more cross-border cooperation between national police forces .
" profiteers of the past are trying to launder their reputations and money through business and politics , " said costa .
" future crime trends in the balkans will depend on the rule of law , integrity in governance and political ability . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

and a waxworks museum would n't be the same without elvis , so even though his only association with germany was his brief spell here as an american gi , the king is there in all his glory too . tennis stars , religious leaders and rock stars are unlikely to raise anybody 's eyebrows .
but standing opposite former british prime minister winston churchill in berlin 's new madame tussauds is none other than adolf hitler .
the figure of the nazi dictator is not placed in a chamber of horrors , as it is in london , but on the history and politics floor along with the dalai lama and berlin mayor klaus wowereit . according to the museum 's spokeswoman , natalie ruoss , the curators were at pains not to give the impression that hitler was in any way a figure to be revered , and have depicted the nazi leader " as a broken man " in a mock-up of the bunker where he spent the final days of world war ii . he 's also positioned behind a barricade , preventing visitors from having their picture taken next to him . place in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists visiting germany are interested in the history of the nazi period " we did surveys while we were planning the exhibition on the street with berliners and with tourists , and the result was quite clear that hitler is one of the figures that they want to see , " ruoss said . " seeing as we are portraying the history of germany , we could hardly have left him out ... we want to show the reality , " she said . stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said some holocaust survivors might find the exhibition offensive but that he was not opposed as long as it was done properly . " hitler should not become a tourist attraction , but if this exhibition helps to some extent to normalize the way of dealing with hitler , as a kind of demystification , let 's try it , " kramer told afp . " erasing him from history is not going to bring the perished ones back , it 's not going to heal the damage that he did , the crimes that he did .
that would be counter-productive , " he said . complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wax figure of german chancellor angela merkel is already on display in london a spokesman for berlin city council meanwhile said that the city 's mayor klaus wowereit had expressed reservations , sending a letter to madame tussauds in london on thursday , may 29 . " he touched on the particular sensitivities on the german side in the question of a presentation of a figure of adolf hitler , " a spokesman said .
" he asked to be shown how madame tussauds intends to present it , and that his concerns be taken into consideration . " meanwhile , politicians across the spectrum have condemned the decision . christian democrat politician michael braun called it " an extraordinary breach of taste " and was echoed by his green party colleague alice ströver , who described it as " tasteless , disgusting and vulgar .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .
" they do n't want to talk at all . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .

" you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out .

" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .

the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .

critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .

but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .

the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..

today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .

and a waxworks museum would n't be the same without elvis , so even though his only association with germany was his brief spell here as an american gi , the king is there in all his glory too . tennis stars , religious leaders and rock stars are unlikely to raise anybody 's eyebrows .
but standing opposite former british prime minister winston churchill in berlin 's new madame tussauds is none other than adolf hitler .
the figure of the nazi dictator is not placed in a chamber of horrors , as it is in london , but on the history and politics floor along with the dalai lama and berlin mayor klaus wowereit . according to the museum 's spokeswoman , natalie ruoss , the curators were at pains not to give the impression that hitler was in any way a figure to be revered , and have depicted the nazi leader " as a broken man " in a mock-up of the bunker where he spent the final days of world war ii . he 's also positioned behind a barricade , preventing visitors from having their picture taken next to him . place in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists visiting germany are interested in the history of the nazi period " we did surveys while we were planning the exhibition on the street with berliners and with tourists , and the result was quite clear that hitler is one of the figures that they want to see , " ruoss said . " seeing as we are portraying the history of germany , we could hardly have left him out ... we want to show the reality , " she said . stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said some holocaust survivors might find the exhibition offensive but that he was not opposed as long as it was done properly . " hitler should not become a tourist attraction , but if this exhibition helps to some extent to normalize the way of dealing with hitler , as a kind of demystification , let 's try it , " kramer told afp . " erasing him from history is not going to bring the perished ones back , it 's not going to heal the damage that he did , the crimes that he did .
that would be counter-productive , " he said . complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wax figure of german chancellor angela merkel is already on display in london a spokesman for berlin city council meanwhile said that the city 's mayor klaus wowereit had expressed reservations , sending a letter to madame tussauds in london on thursday , may 29 . " he touched on the particular sensitivities on the german side in the question of a presentation of a figure of adolf hitler , " a spokesman said .
" he asked to be shown how madame tussauds intends to present it , and that his concerns be taken into consideration . " meanwhile , politicians across the spectrum have condemned the decision . christian democrat politician michael braun called it " an extraordinary breach of taste " and was echoed by his green party colleague alice ströver , who described it as " tasteless , disgusting and vulgar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .
iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said we " kept our commitments " and in remarks during the conference and at the concluding news conference repeated the need for other governments to " forgive debts " and lift sanctions that were imposed after wars waged by the regime of saddam hussein .
he welcomed a statement that neighboring saudi arabia was willing to write off some of its claims , adding that " more information " was needed .
iraqi debt debt relief was also mentioned by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who said the us " would encourage other countries " to write off their debts like bulgaria , serbia , bosnia , slovenia and russia had since the ici process was launched a year ago .
the international monetary fund has estimated that iraq in 2007-2008 settled $ 23 billion dollars of its $ 75 billion -lrb- 48 million-euro -rrb- external debt burden .
" stability in iraq is stability for the region , and any instability in iraq will affect the region as a whole , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters on the sidelines , adding that iran was cooperating with iraq on energy and other areas .
on opening the conference , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt underlined the importance that neighboring countries have had in hosting the flow of refugees from iraq and cited the need to let " the un take the lead in our engagement with iraq .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .

" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .
the remaining $ 1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank 's board of member countries . plans to step up food production world bank president robert zoellick said developing nations - especially in africa - are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production , such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season . " these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .
" we do n't need to reinvent the wheel .
these leaders are asking for action now , " he told reporters in a conference call from japan . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .

she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 30.05.2008 german parliament clears way for rail privatization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privatization advocates say the move will benefit rail passengers the german parliament gave the green light on friday for the partial privatization of deutsche bahn ag by agreeing to a controversial plan to sell off shares in europe 's biggest rail group . chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition on friday , may 30 , approved a proposal in parliament to allow private investors to buy up to 24.9 percent of deutsche bahn 's passenger and logistics operations with deutsche bahn expected to make its stock market debut later this year .
the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .
yougov questioned 6,256 people over the internet between may 23 and 29 , including 2,241 in britain , 1,005 in france , 1,001 in russia , 1,004 in italy and 1,005 in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" turkey is to provide the buildings and running costs , while germany is to recruit professors and top up their salaries . the next phase will be to gather a consortium of german universities willing to second staff and expertise to the project . germany is also setting up a university next year in vietnam , where thousands of people speak german after stays in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .

" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .

eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .

putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .
the remaining $ 1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank 's board of member countries . plans to step up food production world bank president robert zoellick said developing nations - especially in africa - are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production , such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season . " these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .
the remaining $ 1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank 's board of member countries . plans to step up food production world bank president robert zoellick said developing nations - especially in africa - are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production , such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season . " these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .
the remaining $ 1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank 's board of member countries . plans to step up food production world bank president robert zoellick said developing nations - especially in africa - are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production , such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season . " these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 30.05.2008 putting a fresh face on germany 's cigarette industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz -lrb- center -rrb- will be confronted with posters like this one in the future as the world marks no tobacco day on may 31 , dw-world.de takes a look at germany 's cigarette industry , whose new head lobbyist wants to make her work transparent .
a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .
" they do n't want to talk at all . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .

it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .
unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has climbed to record highs recently but whether weak against the dollar , as in 2000 , or strong today , the single currency has failed to win over millions of those who use it daily .
a recent poll found one third of germans would like to go back to deutschmarks .
more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .
temptation has been strong to blame the ecb , which has sole responsibility for the euro , a measure designed to thwart meddling from more than a dozen governments with varied economic and monetary agendas . afp / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .
unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has climbed to record highs recently but whether weak against the dollar , as in 2000 , or strong today , the single currency has failed to win over millions of those who use it daily .
a recent poll found one third of germans would like to go back to deutschmarks .
more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 30.05.2008 german parliament clears way for rail privatization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privatization advocates say the move will benefit rail passengers the german parliament gave the green light on friday for the partial privatization of deutsche bahn ag by agreeing to a controversial plan to sell off shares in europe 's biggest rail group . chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition on friday , may 30 , approved a proposal in parliament to allow private investors to buy up to 24.9 percent of deutsche bahn 's passenger and logistics operations with deutsche bahn expected to make its stock market debut later this year .
the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is set to leave berlin on saturday for a mideast tour , told the bundestag parliament that germany 's responsibility towards israel meant it had to " take a stand against the iranian president 's talk time and again . "
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has faced international criticism for saying israel should be " wiped off the map " and questioning whether the nazi holocaust , in which 6 million jews were killed , actually took place .
" the immeasurable pain germans inflicted on germans and other europeans of jewish faith is part of our history , " steinmeier said .
" action for the future derives from responsibility for the past , " he said .
painful compromises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful solution in the middle east continues to pose numerous challanges steinmeier warned that the " two-state " solution required painful compromises from palestinians and israelis .
he said both sides needed resoluteness and far-sightedness .
germany and the european union could help with the background conditions .
the minister said he saw a little blue in the " middle east sky " with lebanon 's domestic political crisis over , adding that perhaps the conditions were now in place for reconstruction in lebanon .

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .

and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .
yougov questioned 6,256 people over the internet between may 23 and 29 , including 2,241 in britain , 1,005 in france , 1,001 in russia , 1,004 in italy and 1,005 in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .

a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .
iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said we " kept our commitments " and in remarks during the conference and at the concluding news conference repeated the need for other governments to " forgive debts " and lift sanctions that were imposed after wars waged by the regime of saddam hussein .
he welcomed a statement that neighboring saudi arabia was willing to write off some of its claims , adding that " more information " was needed .
iraqi debt debt relief was also mentioned by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who said the us " would encourage other countries " to write off their debts like bulgaria , serbia , bosnia , slovenia and russia had since the ici process was launched a year ago .
the international monetary fund has estimated that iraq in 2007-2008 settled $ 23 billion dollars of its $ 75 billion -lrb- 48 million-euro -rrb- external debt burden .
" stability in iraq is stability for the region , and any instability in iraq will affect the region as a whole , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters on the sidelines , adding that iran was cooperating with iraq on energy and other areas .
on opening the conference , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt underlined the importance that neighboring countries have had in hosting the flow of refugees from iraq and cited the need to let " the un take the lead in our engagement with iraq .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .

eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "

" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .

europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .
the remaining $ 1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank 's board of member countries . plans to step up food production world bank president robert zoellick said developing nations - especially in africa - are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production , such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season . " these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .

haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages . another 10 countries have made requests for grants .

" these initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices , " zoellick said in a statement . total world bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $ 6 billion in 2009 from $ 4 billion in 2008 , the development bank said . zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a un meeting in rome from june 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .

" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .
unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has climbed to record highs recently but whether weak against the dollar , as in 2000 , or strong today , the single currency has failed to win over millions of those who use it daily .
a recent poll found one third of germans would like to go back to deutschmarks .
more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .
temptation has been strong to blame the ecb , which has sole responsibility for the euro , a measure designed to thwart meddling from more than a dozen governments with varied economic and monetary agendas . afp / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .

it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .
iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said we " kept our commitments " and in remarks during the conference and at the concluding news conference repeated the need for other governments to " forgive debts " and lift sanctions that were imposed after wars waged by the regime of saddam hussein .
he welcomed a statement that neighboring saudi arabia was willing to write off some of its claims , adding that " more information " was needed .
iraqi debt debt relief was also mentioned by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who said the us " would encourage other countries " to write off their debts like bulgaria , serbia , bosnia , slovenia and russia had since the ici process was launched a year ago .
the international monetary fund has estimated that iraq in 2007-2008 settled $ 23 billion dollars of its $ 75 billion -lrb- 48 million-euro -rrb- external debt burden .
" stability in iraq is stability for the region , and any instability in iraq will affect the region as a whole , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters on the sidelines , adding that iran was cooperating with iraq on energy and other areas .
on opening the conference , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt underlined the importance that neighboring countries have had in hosting the flow of refugees from iraq and cited the need to let " the un take the lead in our engagement with iraq .

another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .
yougov questioned 6,256 people over the internet between may 23 and 29 , including 2,241 in britain , 1,005 in france , 1,001 in russia , 1,004 in italy and 1,005 in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.05.2008 putin feted as head of state on visit to france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's trip suggested he 's the one calling the foreign policy shots russian pm putin discussed eu-russia relations during a two-day visit to france , his first trip abroad since stepping down as head of state .
his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .

eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.05.2008 putin feted as head of state on visit to france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's trip suggested he 's the one calling the foreign policy shots russian pm putin discussed eu-russia relations during a two-day visit to france , his first trip abroad since stepping down as head of state .
his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.05.2008 putin feted as head of state on visit to france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's trip suggested he 's the one calling the foreign policy shots russian pm putin discussed eu-russia relations during a two-day visit to france , his first trip abroad since stepping down as head of state .
his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .
" today 's decision secures the future of the company and its 237,000 employees , " he said in a statement .
" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .

" now we must make the partial privatization a success together in the coming months and strengthen germany 's position as a place to do business . "
compromise between parties the privatization of deutsche bahn has been on the cards since 1994 , when the rail operators of the former west and east germany merged .
but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans were delayed by the company 's disastrous financial situation following the unification of the country .
the left-right government was sharply divided between christian democrats backing the privatization and social democrats raising concerns about potential job cuts at deutsche bahn .
they struck a compromise to avoid handing a foreign investor a blocking minority , which german law has set as a 25-percent stake in a company .
deutsche bahn and trade unions have also agreed on a plan that would prevent any layoffs at the company until 2023 .
analysts say the planned partial privatization should generate about six billion euros -lrb- $ 9.3 billion -rrb- with proponents of the sell-off saying it would help to mobilize capital for the railway .
experts criticize plan but the 24.9 percent share sell off , which was proposed by social democratic chief kurt beck as a compromise , falls short of the 49.9 percent that merkel 's supporters have argued for .
indeed , senior members of merkel 's christian democratic union have indicated that they see the 24.9 percent as representing possibly the sale of the first tranche of shares in the railway company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's partial privatization follows years of wrangling between germany 's politicians moreover , analysts have criticized the privatization model as resulting in only a small parcel of shares being sold off .
this could result in the stock ending up principally in the hands of big institutional investors , some analysts say .
under the plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight operations .
the partial privatization , however , means that berlin would retain a 100-percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers of track network and energy supplier operations . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag vote saw 355 deputies approve the measure with 153 against and three abstaining .
nearly 100 mps did not cast a ballot .
the move by the bundestag to sign off on the privatization plan came despite the three opposition parties voting against the sell-off and stiff resistance from the influential leftwing faction of the social democrats , the junior member of merkel 's conservative-led coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn promises the sell-off will benefit passengers " it is a good day for -lrb- rail -rrb- travelers , taxpayers and employees , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said .

" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .

" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .

his reception marked a break with the usual protocol for prime ministers . less than a month after his successor dmitry medvedev took over in the kremlin , vladimir putin held talks with his french counterpart francois fillon before sharing a working dinner with president nicolas sarkozy at the elysee palace .
sarkozy 's decision to meet putin breaks with the past practice of group of eight leaders of dealing with russia at the presidential level .
the special treatment accorded to putin , who was president for eight years , underscored the view in paris that he remains a predominant player in russian affairs .
in turn , russia is looking to france to help it improve its strained relations with the 27-nation european union .
putin won assurances from fillon that paris was ready to pull its weight : " during the french presidency we would like to move forward and why not even conclude the strategic partnership agreement between russia and the european union , " fillon told reporters .
france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
" we hope this will enable us to advance negotiations on a strategic partnership , " said putin .
strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin upstaging dmitry medvedev ?
eu member states on monday approved the launch of negotiations with moscow on the new partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which covers energy , trade and political ties .
after two years of acrimony over the issue caused by disagreements between russia and eastern eu members , talks are now expected to start in june .
" we have agreed that we will together work for the earliest beginning of talks on a new strategic partnership , " said putin .
" we paid a lot of attention to it during talks . "
putin also invited europeans to invest in russia , including its energy sector , citing the signature of the french oil giant total last february of an accord to participate in a major oil project in the barents sea .
he said he regretted the amount of emphasis placed on primary materials in eu-russian trade and urged development of high technology projects in the space , aeronautical and automotive industries .
the oil issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , right , with french prime minister francois fillon france was " open to russian projects , " said fillon , who nonetheless stressed the need for a legal framework to develop such cooperation .
" energy security in europe depends on calm relations with russia , " he added , referring to concern in western europe that russia might try to exploit its gas and oil supplies to western europe for political purposes .
putin meanwhile deflected questions on whether russia would be prepared to help france and other energy consumer nations cope with soaring oil prices .
" russia is not the one setting the price of oil , but the market , " putin said .
" if russia were setting the price , then i think we could agree , but that is not the case - not yet . "
france earlier this week urged its partners in the g7 group of leading industrialized nations to press oil-producing nations to increase their output and lower oil prices that have hit record highs of more than $ 130 a barrel .
russia is the world 's second largest producer of oil and the number one supplier of natural gas .
nato enlargement the thorny question of enlarging nato to include former soviet republics ukraine and georgia - opposed by moscow - was raised at the meeting later the same day with sarkozy , said fillon .
following their working dinner , sarkozy 's office said in a statement that " the visit of mr putin to paris only several weeks after the forming of a new russian government is an indication of the desire of our two countries to maintain a regular dialogue at the highest level . "
human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power in moscow has shifted putin evaded questions about human right violations - another thorny issue in russia-eu relations - saying it was now the responsibility of president medvedev .
" these kinds of questions are in the competence of the president of the russian federation , " putin said , adding that media reports about human rights violations in russia were grossly exaggerated and used as a tool for political pressure .
sarkozy has been accused in france of excessive warmth towards russia and for failing to keep his pre-election pledges to press the kremlin over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .
yougov questioned 6,256 people over the internet between may 23 and 29 , including 2,241 in britain , 1,005 in france , 1,001 in russia , 1,004 in italy and 1,005 in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

although seen as one of the most powerful financial organizations in the world , it is unloved by europeans and frequented criticized by politicians . the ecb was created on june 1 1998 , tasked with launching the single european currency six months later in an unprecedented enterprise that marked a giant step in european integration .
the relatively smooth operation took years of preparation and changed the lives of 320 million people .
on the plus side the single currency has made it easier to do business and compare prices , while allowing tourists to go from country to country without changing money .
" between euro area countries , there is now more trade in goods and services , greater financial integration ... and increasing foreign direct investment and cross-border portfolio holdings , as well as sustained job creation , " the ecb said in a special monthly bulletin devoted to its first decade in existence .
since the single european currency was launched in 1999 , the eurozone has generated 15 million new jobs and unemployment is at its lowest level since the early 1980s , in part owing to reforms needed to join the bloc .
the euro has now attained the rank of the world 's second reserve currency after the dollar .
one sign of trust in the euro is that companies and countries emit growing numbers of bonds in the single currency , and there are now more euros circulating worldwide than dollars .
challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude trichet even so , the ecb continues to weather cynicism from critics , complaints that the euro stoked inflation and political crossfire over its independence and policies .
ecb president jean-claude trichet stressed thursday the need to fight persistent inflation .
the bank 's target rate , of just below 2.0 percent , has never been met .
in march eurozone inflation hit a record 3.6 percent , with economists forecasting similar if not higher levels in the months to come owing to soaring oil and food prices , over which the ecb has no control .
critics say the central bank is concerned only with fighting inflation and does not consider the consequences on economic growth and employment .
trichet counters by stressing that ensuring price stability is the best , if not the only , way to lay a foundation for long-term growth ..
goals the ecb was born with a high-risk mission of launching the euro and managing the monetary affairs of the new eurozone , one of the biggest economies in the world .
today , the ecb and euro are widely seen as the primary symbols of the 15-nation eurozone , formed to overcome chronic and costly currency instability ; to give monetary expression to the european union 's nascent political stature ; to incite members towards greater fiscal discipline ; to spur competition within a single market ; and to help europeans identify with efforts towards greater integration .
but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .
but " the improvement in communications has more to do with a mutual learning process between the ecb and markets than with the transition from duisenberg to trichet , " bank of america senior economist holger schmieding told afp .
unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has climbed to record highs recently but whether weak against the dollar , as in 2000 , or strong today , the single currency has failed to win over millions of those who use it daily .
a recent poll found one third of germans would like to go back to deutschmarks .
more than half associated the single currency with sharply higher food and fuel prices , a sentiment found throughout the eurozone .
counter arguments that the euro has helped buffer the eurozone from global financial turmoil , or that meeting membership criteria led to interest rates for mortgages way below what they were previously , are less well understood .
it has proved hard to provide the single currency with a cohesive identity while european political union remained more theoretical than real .
temptation has been strong to blame the ecb , which has sole responsibility for the euro , a measure designed to thwart meddling from more than a dozen governments with varied economic and monetary agendas . afp / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .

the numbers were , however , different from country to country .
the likely democratic candidate held a 61-point lead in germany , but was practically on par with his republican counterpart in russia , where obama was leading by only 7 points .
70 percent of italian respondents said they would vote for the democrat .
some 42 percent also said obama was better equipped to lead the global economy out of its current set of problems , compared to 22 percent who backed mccain .
a question of reputation overall , just 27 percent of those questioned said they thought the united states was a " force for good " in the world , with 43 percent opting to describe it as a " force for evil " - only in italy did more respondents choose the former than the latter .
anti-american feelings were particularly evident in russia , where only 16 percent said the united states was a " force for good " , with 56 percent branding it as a " force for evil " .
40 percent of german respondents saw the us in the extremely negative light , with 25 percent valuing its positive contribution in the world , and 36 percent saying they did not have a particular opinion on the question .
yougov questioned 6,256 people over the internet between may 23 and 29 , including 2,241 in britain , 1,005 in france , 1,001 in russia , 1,004 in italy and 1,005 in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .

" he said schaefer , equipped with his own staff to question personnel and recommend new privacy guidelines , will begin work next tuesday . snooping scandal sparks outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can gerhard schaefer help to salvage telekom 's tattered image ?
europe 's largest phone company is under fire over reports it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs . telekom this week acknowledged illegal monitoring of phone records .
prosecutors have opened investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel . the affair has sparked an outcry in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives , reviving debate about whether phone companies should even keep records of calls . new german legislation requires the records to be kept in case they need to be seized by court order for crime inquiries . personal data protection and privacy are sensitive issues in germany ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes . the scandal threatened to widen when a german newspaper alleged that telekom had also spied on the bank records of board members and journalists as well as details of their phone calls .
another business newspaper has said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom . government calls for self-regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security carries a particular resonance in germany on friday , the german government weighed in , demanding that telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the privacy breaches at telekom . politicians in germany have long debated the need for self-regulation among companies , most recently amid outrage over soaring salaries of top corporate managers . but dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said in an interview he remained skeptical about companies voluntarily coming up with a moral code of conduct in such matters . " you apparently ca n't leave it to business to protect business data , " he told daily kölner stadtanzeiger , saying there was " a lack of the least bit of decency and respect for laws " in certain business quarters .
the politician compared telekom 's handling of its own customer data to a food company that mixed poison with its food . he called for a complete overhaul of the company , saying " telekom 's dirty business has to be cleaned out . " a spokesman for the interior ministry , however , told news agency dpa that government representatives are to meet in berlin on monday with telekom 's bosses to discuss how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 30.05.2008 putting a fresh face on germany 's cigarette industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz -lrb- center -rrb- will be confronted with posters like this one in the future as the world marks no tobacco day on may 31 , dw-world.de takes a look at germany 's cigarette industry , whose new head lobbyist wants to make her work transparent .
a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .

she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .

" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .

" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .

they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .

it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .

but despite its sometimes heroic efforts , the ecb still stands out as a target for politicians and eurozone residents .
following a sometimes bumpy start under the guidance of wim duisenberg , ecb communications have been fine-tuned since jean-claude trichet took over in october 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has faced international criticism for saying israel should be " wiped off the map " and questioning whether the nazi holocaust , in which 6 million jews were killed , actually took place .
" the immeasurable pain germans inflicted on germans and other europeans of jewish faith is part of our history , " steinmeier said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .

the spot price had risen from 28 cents to more than 40 cents . " we ca n't import enough milk to cover the shortfall , " he said at his company 's office in kleve near the dutch border . schaber 's group , which hopes a successful boycott will make that price rise permanent , claimed the boycott had reduced the supply of milk to german pasteurizing plants and cheese factories by 70 percent .
he estimated that 70,000 of germany 's 100,000 dairy farms had joined the boycott . however germany 's national farmers ' union dismissed the claim .
a spokeswoman there said only 10 to 20 percent of farmers had joined the bdm 's campaign , with most continuing to supply milk .
she said she knew of no substantial support abroad for the bdm . the farmers blamed powerful dairy companies for depressing the farm-gate price of milk , and are also angry at eu plans to increase output quotas .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . before the boycott , the dairy factories of germany were paying 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . first joint swiss-eu milk strike in switzerland , action that started in the german-speaking north and east of the country tuesday spread to the french-speaking southwest with producers withholding deliveries and buyers reporting the first sign of a squeeze on supplies . up to 400 members of the union uniterre joined a two-day strike starting thursday and followed the lead taken by several hundred members of its counterpart big-m in zurich , zug and basel . milk fetches around 75 centimes a liter currently with farmers insisting that no longer covers production costs .
they say they are being choked by increased costs , namely the rise in the price of fuel . big-m is asking for an increase of 10 centimes per liter from july 1 and both unions wish to see milk sold at one franc a liter eventually . " this is a first that swiss and european milk producers have mounted a joint campaign to stage a strike , " said jacques barras of uniterre , speaking on swiss television . he admitted milk would have to be wasted .
" i can not lie and say all the milk will be used .
as much as possible will be distributed to the population or taken to farms where it can be used , " said barras . " there will be milk that will have to be thrown away though .

" -lrb- iraq -rrb- is stepping back from the abyss that we feared most , " he said , while stressing that the situation remains fragile .
full support the summit was co-chaired by iraq and the united nations , and hosted by sweden as the first follow-up to the international compact for iraq -lrb- ici -rrb- launched a year ago at a summit in egypt .
the five-year ici process aimed at increasing international support for iraq 's commitment to improve security , human rights and economic development .
nearly 100 delegations and up to 600 political leaders and diplomats from the arab world , europe , the us and iran took part .
ban ki-moon said the turn-out " tells you that iraq enjoys the full support of the international community . "
investments and more trade with iraq were highlighted in the document that also mentioned the need to reduce iraq 's debts and urged baghdad to continue to safeguard " the rights of women , minorities and other vulnerable groups . "
iraq invited delegates to take part in a follow-up meeting next year in baghdad , signalling confidence that gains in security would be sustained .
ban ki-moon said he was " quite confident " that iraq would be able to convene that meeting .
signs of hope earlier , ban ki-moon said " notable progress " had been made in security , political and economic areas , but cautioned that the " iraqi people continue to suffer from acts of terrorism , sectarian violence and criminality . "
however , he stressed that there were positive signs .
" there is new hope that the people and the government of iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country , " he said .
iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said we " kept our commitments " and in remarks during the conference and at the concluding news conference repeated the need for other governments to " forgive debts " and lift sanctions that were imposed after wars waged by the regime of saddam hussein .
he welcomed a statement that neighboring saudi arabia was willing to write off some of its claims , adding that " more information " was needed .
iraqi debt debt relief was also mentioned by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who said the us " would encourage other countries " to write off their debts like bulgaria , serbia , bosnia , slovenia and russia had since the ici process was launched a year ago .
the international monetary fund has estimated that iraq in 2007-2008 settled $ 23 billion dollars of its $ 75 billion -lrb- 48 million-euro -rrb- external debt burden .
" stability in iraq is stability for the region , and any instability in iraq will affect the region as a whole , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters on the sidelines , adding that iran was cooperating with iraq on energy and other areas .
on opening the conference , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt underlined the importance that neighboring countries have had in hosting the flow of refugees from iraq and cited the need to let " the un take the lead in our engagement with iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 30.05.2008 germany looks to boost biking as europe pedals past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for cyclists , " critical mass " is important germany wants to double its bicycle traffic by 2012 .
while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .
and there are so many cyclists in denmark that they have introduced bicycle " fast lanes " for two-wheeled speed demons .
other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .
belgium offers a small tax break for those who bike to work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what this sign means is anyone 's guess there 's even a glimmer of hope coming from spain , which at 0.7 percent has the lowest percentage of trips by bicycle in western europe - roughly on par with the united states .
a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .
the meeting brings bicycling authorities together from across europe to network and discuss the latest city planning ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has gotten kudos for improving its bike routes some cities , such as kielce in central poland , have set up bike programs which look to denmark as a role model .
warsaw , budapest and prague have hosted so-called critical mass events , where tens of thousands of bicycle enthusiasts have taken over the streets .
“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .
" all cities have to work more together and to be more proactive , ” he said .
according to calvelli , biking has become an essential form of commuting that needs to be taken into account any time a new road is built , subdivision planned or bus line reconfigured .
making that happen will keep cycling advocates pedaling hard for the near future . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .

other european cities are beginning to follow the dutch-danish lead .
paris has impressed bicycle enthusiasts by offering bike sharing and making other improvements .
london poured money into improving biking infrastructure and has seen a sharp increase in bike ridership .

a recent program in the southern city of seville has linked all parts of the city to the center and to train stations .
yet for every success story , there are plenty of examples of business owners fighting to keep a street open to traffic or residents opposed to bike lanes that will take away street parking .
and the amount of money european governments invest in biking is very small .
while no europe-wide figures exist , bike investments are “ peanuts ” compared to what is invested in roads , ecf 's kuester said .
east looks west in recent years , bicycle advocates have turned their gaze eastward to the newer european union countries .
countries such as hungary , poland and the czech republic are at a crossroads , said raphael calvelli , an italian-based bike activist who helps coordinate meetbike through the technical university of dresden .

“ it 's good to feel that across europe we can compare and we can see that we are facing the same problems , " calvelli said .

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .

while breaking germany 's car addiction has proved a major challenge , other european cities have shown it 's possible to make the switch . in most german city centers , biking beats out driving as the fastest way to get around .
during the morning rush hour , it 's not uncommon to see cars creeping forward while cyclists zip past .
the incentives for germans to bike have never been better , with a medium-sized car sucking away at least 70 euros -lrb- $ 109 -rrb- per tank of gasoline .
but as germany 's daily traffic jams show , biking has yet to reach the critical mass that it has in amsterdam or copenhagen where one out of every four trips -lrb- which includes not only cars , but also foot traffic and public transportation -rrb- is made by bike .
when compared with other european countries “ germany is really not that far along ” in promoting cycling said bettina cibulski of the german cycling federation -lrb- adfc -rrb- .
rubber meets the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour in german cities requires patience germany 's love affair with the automobile is usually blamed for its dearth of biking commuters .
yet there is a growing realization that germany will need to promote biking , walking and public transportation if it hopes to meet its environmental goals of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
a german transport ministry plan calls for bicycles to make up 20 percent of overall traffic by 2012 , double the current rate .
while cycling advocates were skeptical that this goal will be met , the federal ministry of transport is “ quite confident that it will happen , ” said spokeswoman vera moosmayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg ranks near the top for german biking cities the bike to work campaign , which starts on friday , may 30 , is seen as crucial to reaching this goal .
last year , 20,000 companies took part , said cibulski .
the three-year-old national campaign gives employees extra incentives to bike to work during germany 's nicest weather months , hoping to start a habit that will continue even when the rain hits , cibulski said .
say you want a revolution ?
it 's not only the climate change debate and rising gas prices that make europe poised for a cycling revolution .
most european city dwellers already have lifestyles conducive to cycling , said fabian kuester of the brussels-based european cyclists ' federation -lrb- ecf -rrb- , an advocacy group which promotes cycling across the continent .
half of all trips europeans make on a daily basis are under 5 kilometers -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- .
“ that is the perfect cycling distance , ” kuester said .
yet getting cities to change to accommodate bikes is often painfully slow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking for pleasure is n't the same as biking to work “ it 's difficult because you have to make choices , ” kuester said .
“ you have to reallocate space .
you have to take space away from a car and give it to cyclists or pedestrians . ”
and making a city bike-friendly goes far beyond adding bike lanes , said ralph herbertz , a biking enthusiast who pedals around the industrial german city of cologne .
bicyclists do n't like to be constantly stopped by long red lights .
they do n't like to be shut out of one-way residential streets .
they want parking that is both plentiful and secure .
they need to be able to easily take a bike on a bus or a train .
despite all these challenges , herbertz - a long-time adfc member who works as a bike consultant for the city of cologne - said he 's noticed many positive changes in recent years .
the city , which is regarded as one of germany 's least bicycle-friendly , is riding a “ new wave ” of interest .
“ that 's what 's really exciting , ” herbertz said .
european cities show off their bike sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a parking spot can be a challenge in europe , dutch and danish cities are the gold standard for cycling .
the first sight greeting visitors who step out of the main train station in amsterdam is a multi-level parking garage exclusively for bicycles .

a major tobacco player and critics are n't convinced . " are the demonstrators there yet ? "
marianne tritz asks and almost seems eager to meet up with the other side .
the executive director of the newly founded german cigarette association -lrb- dzv -rrb- has already had several run-ins with anti-tobacco activists , who were planning an early world no tobacco day demonstration in front of her office . tritz says that she 's tried to engage protesters in conversations - to no avail .
she says that one activist usually dresses up as a cigarette and that she 's unsuccessfully asked him to show her his face out of fairness and courtesy . fairness and courtesy are two key values that tritz also wants to bring to her new job as spokeswoman for cigarette producers with a german market share of more than 60 percent . with far-reaching smoking bans in place in germany 's federal states and the industry struggling with a negative image , tritz wants to avoid the tobacco lobby 's mistakes of the past - submitting draft bills on anti-smoking legislation or funding scientific research on the effects of smoking . " it 's completely irrelevant whether passive smoking is more or less harmful , " tritz says .
" there 's a societal consensus that people should not be exposed to passive smoke and i have to accept that . " watered-down approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tritz says she quit smoking without any help a heavy smoker herself until a few years ago , tritz , who 's now 44 , says she quit because she no longer had the time to enjoy it .
she calls herself a " tolerant non-smoker " and says that she 's not bothered when people smoke next to her in restaurants . while dzv employees are allowed to smoke in their offices - and some clearly do - tritz rarely lets people light up in hers .
the only addictive substances she offers to most visitors are coffee and donuts .
even less would do , as far as she 's concerned . " i 'd much rather sit down with parliamentarians over a bottle of water than put on a show , " she says .
" we want to talk with politicians and represent our interests .
it 's our role to deliver arguments .
it 's the role of politicians to make decisions . " switching sides tritz should know what she 's talking about .
as a 21-year-old , she became the executive director of an anti-nuclear citizens group and joined the greens .
in 2002 , she was elected to the german parliament and kept working for her party as a foreign policy expert after losing her mandate in 2005 . her switch from germany 's anti-smoking party to the tobacco lobby in march raised some eyebrows and made even more headlines .
tritz says that the challenge to build up a lobbying organization of a major industry from scratch was too good to reject . to do so , she 's hired an agency to help her develop a strategy . " it 'll be low key , " she says .
" we wo n't have ad campaigns .
there will be events in a pleasant environment , but everything has to have substance . " smuggled cigarettes , for example , are a concern that tritz wants to focus on , since this is a major problem for the industry . cowboy tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip morris could live with a complete ban on cigarette adversiting that 's something that people at philip morris can agree with , but that 's as far as they will go .
germany 's leading cigarette producer is not part of the dzv and the company 's withdrawal led to the disbanding of the industry 's previous association last year . " we have differing opinions on important questions regarding the cigarette industry - especially as far as the future is concerned , " says philip morris spokeswoman elfriede buben .
" we want clear and unambiguous regulations for the tobacco industry . " the company has no objections to tobacco advertising bans on billboards and in movie theaters , for example .
it 's also pushing for larger cigarette packs , saying that this would also contribute to preventing teenagers from smoking as the packs would cost more . that 's easy to say for the market leader , who is bound to benefit from an advertising ban while smaller firms will suffer , tritz says . " philip morris is lobbying aggressively , " she says .
" they 're acting like cowboys .
no one 's going to believe them that they 're promoting an advertising ban to protect teens . " real role models dzv members are already doing what they can to keep children and teenagers from smoking , tritz added .
they 're not using role models such as athletes for commercials and have stopped passing out free promotional cigarette packs , for example .
but they 're against a complete ban on advertising - after all , cigarettes are still a legal product . " i do n't think you can keep teens from smoking by banning the product from sight , " says tritz , who has two children .
she adds that adults as responsible role models are much more effective . " i 'm really intolerant and get aggressive when i see people who smoke in their cars while kids are sitting in the back or who smoke while they 're carrying their children in their arms , " she says . wolf in sheep 's clothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-smoking activist spatz -lrb- right -rrb- does n't think the revamp will change anything that 's probably a feeling shared by the anti-tobacco activists of forum smoke-free that have now gathered in front of the dzv 's building .
they 've brought along a green sandbox filled with cigarette butts collected on playgrounds . but johannes spatz , who heads the group , says he 's not hopeful for the new organization . " this new sobriety , this reputed objectivity is a deception , " he says .
" it 's still the tobacco industry .
it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing . " when tritz shows up minutes later , spatz refuses to let her speak to the crowd and helps to dump the cigarette butts in front of tritz 's feet .
she tells the group that she thinks it 's great that they 've picked up the butts from playgrounds .
she also says that she thinks it 's irresponsible for them to drop their smelly load on the street .
and then she realizes that talking with the other side might not be an option . " i do n't think that 's possible , " she says after spatz and his co-demonstrators have left again .
" they do n't want to talk at all . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and a waxworks museum would n't be the same without elvis , so even though his only association with germany was his brief spell here as an american gi , the king is there in all his glory too . tennis stars , religious leaders and rock stars are unlikely to raise anybody 's eyebrows .
but standing opposite former british prime minister winston churchill in berlin 's new madame tussauds is none other than adolf hitler .
the figure of the nazi dictator is not placed in a chamber of horrors , as it is in london , but on the history and politics floor along with the dalai lama and berlin mayor klaus wowereit . according to the museum 's spokeswoman , natalie ruoss , the curators were at pains not to give the impression that hitler was in any way a figure to be revered , and have depicted the nazi leader " as a broken man " in a mock-up of the bunker where he spent the final days of world war ii . he 's also positioned behind a barricade , preventing visitors from having their picture taken next to him . place in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists visiting germany are interested in the history of the nazi period " we did surveys while we were planning the exhibition on the street with berliners and with tourists , and the result was quite clear that hitler is one of the figures that they want to see , " ruoss said . " seeing as we are portraying the history of germany , we could hardly have left him out ... we want to show the reality , " she said . stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said some holocaust survivors might find the exhibition offensive but that he was not opposed as long as it was done properly . " hitler should not become a tourist attraction , but if this exhibition helps to some extent to normalize the way of dealing with hitler , as a kind of demystification , let 's try it , " kramer told afp . " erasing him from history is not going to bring the perished ones back , it 's not going to heal the damage that he did , the crimes that he did .
that would be counter-productive , " he said . complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wax figure of german chancellor angela merkel is already on display in london a spokesman for berlin city council meanwhile said that the city 's mayor klaus wowereit had expressed reservations , sending a letter to madame tussauds in london on thursday , may 29 . " he touched on the particular sensitivities on the german side in the question of a presentation of a figure of adolf hitler , " a spokesman said .
" he asked to be shown how madame tussauds intends to present it , and that his concerns be taken into consideration . " meanwhile , politicians across the spectrum have condemned the decision . christian democrat politician michael braun called it " an extraordinary breach of taste " and was echoed by his green party colleague alice ströver , who described it as " tasteless , disgusting and vulgar .

pascal lamy , the director-general of the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , told the bbc that " a little more prudential regulation " could have helped prevent the banking crisis that has engulfed the us and europe .
mr lamy said that the fundamental problem was that here was no international consensus on how to regulate the rapidly changing world financial markets or who should be the regulator .
the wto boss also said that workers hurt by globalisation should receive more help from their governments .
mr lamy 's remarks put him at odds with the so-called " washington consensus " that liberalisation , privatisation , and open markets are the only way to bring about economic growth .
trade talks the wto chief said he was hopeful that the long-stalled doha round of world trade talks could be revived soon , with a meeting of trade ministers in july .
the trade talks , which have been going on for seven years , have stalled over disagreements between rich and poor countries , and growing public opposition to globalisation .
the wto chief said he well understood the concerns of those workers who feared that globalisation would cost them their jobs , but argued that the wto was " not an advocate of unfettered globalisation . '
and he criticised governments - including the us - for not providing enough domestic support , including retraining and job programmes , to help workers displaced by changing global trading patterns .
trade was often just " an excuse " for not making the necessary adjustments in domestic policy to support workers hit by globalisation , he said .
and he added that he was not surprised that protests were strongest in the us , because it has the weakest system of social protection .
protectionist pressures mr lamy said that he understood the growing protectionist pressures around the world , especially in the us , and accepted that the fears about the too-rapid pace of economic change were genuine .
but he said that there were clear economic gains to be made by freeing up world trade , providing that the inevitable losers were compensated by " appropriate domestic policies " .
the problem which protectionism poses for world trade talks is most acute in the us , he said .
the two democratic candidates vying for the presidency , hillary clinton and barak obama , have been increasingly critical of trade deals during their fierce battle in the primaries .
however he insisted that the wto was still hopeful that that the us would take an active part in the current round of trade talks , and that whoever won the presidential election in november , would see the importance of the us continuing to negotiate .
food fight the doha round of talks were launched in 2001 and aimed at freeing up trade in agriculture in order to benefit developing countries .
the talks broke down in july 2006 over disagreements between the us and the eu over the size of the cuts in agricultural subsidies that each of them would have to make to open up their markets to poor countries .
now mr lamy believes that the two sides are much closer together , with the us pledging to cut 70 % to 80 % of its domestic subsidies - something that is not yet reflected in the farm bill that is being considered by the us congress .
and he says that the recent rises in world food prices have actually made the task of the trade negotiations easier , as farmers in the rich countries no longer need subsidies to make a profit .
but he warned that action is urgent , because high food prices are here to stay .
the growing global food crisis has worried many poor countries , who feel a stronger need for policies to protect their own farmers and to ensure that they can become more self-sufficient in agriculture .
but mr lamy said that the proposed trade deal would ensure that poor countries would be able to act in emergencies and special circumstances to protect key products .
he said the best way to end the food crisis was to encourage economic growth and eliminate poverty so that the poor would be able to afford a decent diet .
economic slowdown mr lamy said there was no doubt that the effects of the global financial crisis were extremely serious , especially for the us and europe .
world economic growth and world trade are both slowing sharply .
but mr lamy argued that the growing economic power of emerging market countries such as brazil , china , and india was a crucial counter-weight to the slowdown in the rich countries , adding that this would not have been possible without the expansion of free trade .
mr lamy has had a difficult role since he became the head of the wto just three years ago .
now he is hoping that his last-ditch attempt to achieve a trade breakthrough will succeed .

food fight the doha round of talks were launched in 2001 and aimed at freeing up trade in agriculture in order to benefit developing countries .
the talks broke down in july 2006 over disagreements between the us and the eu over the size of the cuts in agricultural subsidies that each of them would have to make to open up their markets to poor countries .
now mr lamy believes that the two sides are much closer together , with the us pledging to cut 70 % to 80 % of its domestic subsidies - something that is not yet reflected in the farm bill that is being considered by the us congress .

the growing global food crisis has worried many poor countries , who feel a stronger need for policies to protect their own farmers and to ensure that they can become more self-sufficient in agriculture .

he said the best way to end the food crisis was to encourage economic growth and eliminate poverty so that the poor would be able to afford a decent diet .

world economic growth and world trade are both slowing sharply .

wto chief , pascal lamy , on globalisation pascal lamy , the director-general of the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , told the bbc that " a little more prudential regulation " could have helped prevent the banking crisis that has engulfed the us and europe .
mr lamy said that the fundamental problem was that here was no international consensus on how to regulate the rapidly changing world financial markets or who should be the regulator .
the wto boss also said that workers hurt by globalisation should receive more help from their governments .
mr lamy 's remarks put him at odds with the so-called " washington consensus " that liberalisation , privatisation , and open markets are the only way to bring about economic growth .
trade talks the wto chief said he was hopeful that the long-stalled doha round of world trade talks could be revived soon , with a meeting of trade ministers in july .
the trade talks , which have been going on for seven years , have stalled over disagreements between rich and poor countries , and growing public opposition to globalisation .
the wto chief said he well understood the concerns of those workers who feared that globalisation would cost them their jobs , but argued that the wto was " not an advocate of unfettered globalisation . '
and he criticised governments - including the us - for not providing enough domestic support , including retraining and job programmes , to help workers displaced by changing global trading patterns .
there is strong opposition in the us to subsidy cuts for farmers trade was often just " an excuse " for not making the necessary adjustments in domestic policy to support workers hit by globalisation , he said .
and he added that he was not surprised that protests were strongest in the us , because it has the weakest system of social protection .
protectionist pressures mr lamy said that he understood the growing protectionist pressures around the world , especially in the us , and accepted that the fears about the too-rapid pace of economic change were genuine .
but he said that there were clear economic gains to be made by freeing up world trade , providing that the inevitable losers were compensated by " appropriate domestic policies " .
the problem which protectionism poses for world trade talks is most acute in the us , he said .

northern rock is to more than double the number of people who work in its debt management department over the next year , the bbc has learned .
the move to redeploy staff suggests the bank is expecting to see a huge increase in the number customers who are struggling to pay their mortgages .
the details were in a document outlining how the firm proposes to trim about 2,000 jobs by 2011 .
northern rock said the details could change after consultation with unions .
the bank 's proposals would see the workforce of about 5,485 people reduced to 3,440 over the next three years , according to a document obtained by bbc radio newcastle .
northern rock is having to restructure and scale down following its nationalisation in february after the credit crisis forced it to seek emergency funds .
tempting savers many mortgage lenders are expecting to see a rise in the number of customers who are struggling to meet their mortgage payments as a result of a slowing economy and the prospect of higher unemployment and higher food and fuel prices .
there were the equivalent of 176 full-time workers in northern rock 's debt management arm at the end of april , the memo said .
but it is proposed that this will increase to 444 by the end of march next year , before being trimmed to 282 by december 2011 .
the bank - which is still trying to tempt savers with high interest rates - has no plans to make cuts among staff dealing with savings .

the study , commissioned by post office telecoms , asked people to rate 50 voices then analysed the results .
it found the best female voice to be a mixture of mariella frostrup , dame judi dench and honor blackman .
alan rickman and jeremy irons did best for the men .
the research was conducted by linguist andrew linn , of sheffield university , and sound engineer shannon harris .
the pair worked out their formula based on the combination of tone , speed , frequency , words per minute and intonation .
they concluded the ideal voice should utter no more than 164 words per minute and pause for 0.48 seconds between sentences .
sentences themselves should fall rather than rise in intonation .
vocal traits associated with positive characteristics , such as confidence and trust , scored highly with listeners . "
this formula gives us an exciting glimpse into the way voices work and what makes them appealing or repelling " professor andrew linn professor linn said : " as humans we instinctively know which voices send shivers down our spine and which make us shudder with disgust .
" the emotional responses panellists had to the voices were surprising and go some way to explaining how voiceover artists or radio djs are selected , or why particular celebrity voices appeal . "
he said most men found presenter mariella frostrup 's voice " mesmerising " because it was deep , slow and confident .
actor jeremy irons came very close to the ideal voice model , speaking at 200 words per minute and pausing for 1.2 seconds between sentences .
professor linn said this explained why his " deep gravelly tones " inspired trust in listeners .
he said : " this formula gives us an exciting glimpse into the way voices work and what makes them appealing or repelling . "
the formula showed the bbc 's jonathan ross , on the other hand , spoke too quickly , with very short pauses between sentences .
the researchers said the presenter 's varied range of voice , with frequent highs and lows was associated with expressiveness and intelligence .
but his rising intonation was usually linked with someone weak or unsure .

the claim is made amongst others by zambian artist maiko zulu , also known as st michael , who says many musicians have their music blacklisted because they refuse to pay bribes .
st michael is best known in zambia for a controversial song entitled mad president .
it prompted several fm stations to ban it when it was released earlier this year , describing the song as " too radical " for the air waves .
insulting the president is a criminal offence in zambia , and carries a prison sentence of up to two years .
' incentives ' in mad president , st michael sings : " i am the police the judge and jury , i hire and fire at my own desire . "
" certain djs have had drinks with me on my deal and the following morning they are playing my music like nobody 's business " musician maiko zulu aka st michael " i make my own rules and i do n't need anyone to give me advice .
i know everything .
i am reason for your fear , " he sings .
but st michael says it is not just radical messages in music that has led to their absence from the airwaves .
djs give massive air play to some songs after the singer offers what they commonly refer to as an " incentive " , but which in reality is a bribe , he says .
" this has now affected the royalties we earn from the air play because mediocre artists whose songs play more because of corrupt djs are the ones earning the royalties , " he told the bbc .
his proof , he says , is that after a night out buying drinks for djs , his songs enjoy greater exposure .
" certain djs have had drinks with me on my deal and the following morning they are playing my music like nobody 's business . "
several radio djs do acknowledge that corruption has become common in the business .
' quality control ' but those interviewed by the bbc said would never solicit a bribe to play a tune themselves . "
i do n't accept any bribes " dj chaza chazaso ndhlovu , better known as dj chaza to his fans on hone fm , is one of many djs working at nine fm stations in the capital , lusaka .
he says that as a professional music teacher , his main priority is assessing the quality of the music before playing it .
" i do n't accept any bribes , " he says .
but he admitted that some musicians had offered him money to play their songs or had offered to pay him after he plays their songs .
another dj , mbachi nkhata , who also doubles as programmes manager at q fm , defends the massive air play some songs enjoy on his radio station .
" we have a quality control system in place and djs can not just play anything just because it 's zambian , " he says he dismissed allegations of corruption .
if their music is not played , local artists need to face up to the fact that it may not be as good as they think , he says .
the zambia music copyright protection -lrb- zamcops -rrb- attributes the growing cases of corruption in the industry to the tendency by radio djs to collect the latest music cds directly from musicians .
" the procedure is that the musician is supposed to leave the cds with the radio stations ' libraries , " mutale kaemba , zamcops deputy general manager , says .
" but the problem is that the upcoming radio stations do not have well established libraries . "
she added that zamcops is unable to step in and stop songs being played , even if there is a case of suspected bribery .
but in the end , she said , it came down to quality and the consumer would ultimately reject music not worth paying for .

the claim is made amongst others by zambian artist maiko zulu , also known as st michael , who says many musicians have their music blacklisted because they refuse to pay bribes .
st michael is best known in zambia for a controversial song entitled mad president .
it prompted several fm stations to ban it when it was released earlier this year , describing the song as " too radical " for the air waves .
insulting the president is a criminal offence in zambia , and carries a prison sentence of up to two years .
' incentives ' in mad president , st michael sings : " i am the police the judge and jury , i hire and fire at my own desire . "
certain djs have had drinks with me on my deal and the following morning they are playing my music like nobody 's business musician maiko zulu aka st michael " i make my own rules and i do n't need anyone to give me advice .
i know everything .
i am reason for your fear , " he sings .
but st michael says it is not just radical messages in music that has led to their absence from the airwaves .
djs give massive air play to some songs after the singer offers what they commonly refer to as an " incentive " , but which in reality is a bribe , he says .
" this has now affected the royalties we earn from the air play because mediocre artists whose songs play more because of corrupt djs are the ones earning the royalties , " he told the bbc .
his proof , he says , is that after a night out buying drinks for djs , his songs enjoy greater exposure .
" certain djs have had drinks with me on my deal and the following morning they are playing my music like nobody 's business . "
several radio djs do acknowledge that corruption has become common in the business .
' quality control ' but those interviewed by the bbc said would never solicit a bribe to play a tune themselves .
i do n't accept any bribes dj chaza chazaso ndhlovu , better known as dj chaza to his fans on hone fm , is one of many djs working at nine fm stations in the capital , lusaka .
he says that as a professional music teacher , his main priority is assessing the quality of the music before playing it .
" i do n't accept any bribes , " he says .
but he admitted that some musicians had offered him money to play their songs or had offered to pay him after he plays their songs .
another dj , mbachi nkhata , who also doubles as programmes manager at q fm , defends the massive air play some songs enjoy on his radio station .
" we have a quality control system in place and djs can not just play anything just because it 's zambian , " he says he dismissed allegations of corruption .
if their music is not played , local artists need to face up to the fact that it may not be as good as they think , he says .
the zambia music copyright protection -lrb- zamcops -rrb- attributes the growing cases of corruption in the industry to the tendency by radio djs to collect the latest music cds directly from musicians .
" the procedure is that the musician is supposed to leave the cds with the radio stations ' libraries , " mutale kaemba , zamcops deputy general manager , says .
" but the problem is that the upcoming radio stations do not have well established libraries . "
she added that zamcops is unable to step in and stop songs being played , even if there is a case of suspected bribery .
but in the end , she said , it came down to quality and the consumer would ultimately reject music not worth paying for .

the three , who now face the public vote as they bid to play the feisty nancy , talk about nerves , unusual fan mail and their ideal bill sikes .
how nervous are you and why should you win ?
jessie : i 've actually become a professional nail-biter since the competition started and it 's got worse .
but it 's positive nerves and i want this so much i literally would do anything to win .
when something feels so right you just have to go in fighting for it .
jodie : my nerves are the same every week .
my knees knock when i get on the stage , so it is a scary thing .
i 've never done anything like singing on tv ever before and i really hope i do win because i 've wanted it for so , so long .
i 'm ready to put every bit of heart and soul i can muster up into it .
samantha : i 'm really , really nervous for the final .
it 's exciting to think we 've come this far and now it 's a chance for us to say " well this is me " .
i think i am a raw nancy , and i 've definitely come on a massive journey throughout this competition , which is why i think i should get the part .
what will you do if you lose ?
jessie : it 's not going to be the end of the world and i hope that there 's more opportunities out there for me .
this is a career i have a huge passion for and i want to continue what i love doing .
jodie : i 'd go away with the best experience of a lifetime because i 've never been properly trained , so i take away a wealth of knowledge .
samantha : you 've just got to weigh up all the options of what life throws at you , i suppose .
hopefully , i 'll do some work if i can or go and train .
i do n't know , i 'll just have to play it by ear , i think .
what would you be doing if you had n't entered the contest ?
jessie : i 'd probably be still working as a waitress back in my home town in a small cafe .
i was taking a gap year but hopefully i 'd have been accepted into drama school .
jodie : i set up a company and a group to help people motivate themselves and lose weight so that 's what i 'd still be doing .
i 'd be doing my agony aunt stuff , which i still enjoy .
samantha : i 'd still be at school .
i dropped out to pursue this competition - i was n't going to at first but , as i started getting through the weeks , i had to really .
what sort of support have you had from the public and have you had any unusual fan mail ?
jessie : the public have been fantastic .
the thing people might n't realise is that people back in ireland ca n't vote - it 's the british public who 've kept me in this competition and they 've just been absolutely amazing .
i 've had really , really lovely fan mail from all different ages .
jodie : i 've had the most adorable and humbling letters and , the pictures i 've had from kids , i 've got them all up on my wall .
it 's lovely .
there has n't been a single weird one at all .
samantha : i have n't had strangely unusual fan mail .
i have had some roses and some chocolates from some boys , which was sweet .
i have n't had anything too weird , like a sock or some mittens , which i thought i 'd get because i 'm scared of them .
but i have n't .
so that 's a relief .
what do you think of the judges and do you agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions ?
jessie : i really respect them , they 're all professionals , they 've been in the business for so long and they know what it takes to be a leading lady .
and andrew lloyd webber - i look up to him so much .
any decision that he makes , it 's the right decision at the end of the day .
jodie : i love john and denise , they 're like the perfect mr and mrs. and cameron was lovely when he came on and , well barry 's barry is n't he ?
and you have to agree to a certain extent with andrew because he 's got that wealth of knowledge .
it might not be the person who you want to see go but you have to respect his decision .
samantha : i respect the judges a lot .
so when they give me criticism , i take that on board .
sometimes you do n't agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions .
i would hate to be in his position and everyone who goes is kind of the wrong decision in ways , because you ca n't see any of these girls going .
is graham norton funny when the cameras are n't rolling ?
jessie : he 's a laugh-and-a-half but , on and off camera , he 's exactly the same person , he 's got a personality that just shines out and he 's a lovely guy to be around .
jodie : he 's got a heart of gold and a lot of people do n't see that because , i suppose , you just see him presenting .
he 's so caring and he 's got two of the most adorable dogs you have ever seen .
but he 's a lovely , really grounded fella .
samantha : when the cameras are n't on , i was really surprised because he 's so down to earth and chatty , he does actually care about us all individually .
he is really hilarious which i was pleasantly surprised at because most comedians off camera might be a bit dull , but he 's not at all , he 's brilliant .
how hard is it preparing the routines each week ?
jessie : it 's pretty intense - we do work really hard and there 's never a moment where you 'll see us slacking off , because when we 're not training we 're in the toilets practising our songs .
it 's not a chore for us , we love doing it .
jodie : as the weeks have gone on , it 's got a little bit easier because you know what 's coming .
and we have fun - i like a bit of dancing .
samantha : it 's very hectic to prepare the routines because we 've got so many , and especially this week , but it 's all going to be worth it hopefully .
who is your ideal bill sikes ?
jessie : it would be a close competition between johnny depp and james mcavoy because i have an awful soft spot for james mcavoy , he 's like my ideal guy , so if james mcavoy 's out there i 'd just like to say i 'm single at the moment … i 'm only messing .
jodie : ooh , it would have to be gerard butler from -lsb- romantic comedy -rsb- ps i love you .
do n't worry , i 've got a fella , i 'm taken .
samantha : i think johnny depp would be an incredible bill sikes .
obviously , it 's not going to happen but it would be brilliant because he 's good at getting into character roles and i just think he 'd be a really interesting and different bill sikes .
are you nervous at the prospect of possibly sharing the stage with rowan atkinson ?
jessie : what a privilege and opportunity -lsb- it would be -rsb- to play opposite the mr bean because he 's somebody that you watch in cartoons when you 're growing up .
he 's going to be fantastic .
jodie : i do n't want to imagine him as mr bean because i know that 's so far away , but i just think it would be phenomenal .
i 've grown up with him and blackadder and all the films and series he 's done , and it would be an absolute honour to be on stage with him because he 's just fantastic .
samantha : it would be petrifying but so exciting , he 's just such a massive acting figure , he really gets into his characters and he 's really going to be an incredible fagin so that would be a definite challenge to play alongside him .
what have been your best and worst moments on the show ?
jessie : my best was getting into the final 12 when we were in andrew lloyd webber 's house because it was just that feeling of relief , knowing that people like that believe in you .
probably the worst was waiting to hear if i was in the final 12 because i think that day was definitely the most intense that we 've gone through .
jodie : best was the first show because all the girls had worked so hard and it was the highest energy show - i started crying .
i think i 'm so soppy .
and the worst was stepping into the first audition .
i was so scared , i 'd not really sung in two years and i was just going to give it up .
to step into the audition thinking i might not get it .
i used to be 22 stone and that always used to be the fault for that .
but i was just me now and i had nothing to hide behind , so that was really , really tough for me .
samantha : my best was getting to meet idina menzel -lsb- from the musical wicked -rsb- and getting to sing defying gravity , in a way that she 'd helped me with .
and the worst was finding out you 're in the sing-off , that was a hard moment but then the excitement that i was in the final balanced it out so i was fine in the end .
the contestants were interviewed by bbc news entertainment reporter helen bushby .
the final of i 'd do anything is on bbc one on saturday at 1800 bst with the results at 2045 bst .

what sort of support have you had from the public and have you had any unusual fan mail ?
jessie : the public have been fantastic .
the thing people might n't realise is that people back in ireland ca n't vote - it 's the british public who 've kept me in this competition and they 've just been absolutely amazing .
i 've had really , really lovely fan mail from all different ages .
jodie : i 've had the most adorable and humbling letters and , the pictures i 've had from kids , i 've got them all up on my wall .
it 's lovely .
there has n't been a single weird one at all .

i have n't had anything too weird , like a sock or some mittens , which i thought i 'd get because i 'm scared of them .
but i have n't .
so that 's a relief .
what do you think of the judges and do you agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions ?
jessie : i really respect them , they 're all professionals , they 've been in the business for so long and they know what it takes to be a leading lady .
and andrew lloyd webber - i look up to him so much .
any decision that he makes , it 's the right decision at the end of the day .
jodie : i love john and denise , they 're like the perfect mr and mrs. and cameron was lovely when he came on and , well barry 's barry is n't he ?
and you have to agree to a certain extent with andrew because he 's got that wealth of knowledge .
it might not be the person who you want to see go but you have to respect his decision .
samantha : i respect the judges a lot .
so when they give me criticism , i take that on board .
sometimes you do n't agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions .
i would hate to be in his position and everyone who goes is kind of the wrong decision in ways , because you ca n't see any of these girls going .
is graham norton funny when the cameras are n't rolling ?
jessie : he 's a laugh-and-a-half but , on and off camera , he 's exactly the same person , he 's got a personality that just shines out and he 's a lovely guy to be around .
jodie : he 's got a heart of gold and a lot of people do n't see that because , i suppose , you just see him presenting .
he 's so caring and he 's got two of the most adorable dogs you have ever seen .
but he 's a lovely , really grounded fella .
samantha : when the cameras are n't on , i was really surprised because he 's so down to earth and chatty , he does actually care about us all individually .
he is really hilarious which i was pleasantly surprised at because most comedians off camera might be a bit dull , but he 's not at all , he 's brilliant .
how hard is it preparing the routines each week ?
jessie : it 's pretty intense - we do work really hard and there 's never a moment where you 'll see us slacking off , because when we 're not training we 're in the toilets practising our songs .
it 's not a chore for us , we love doing it .
jodie : as the weeks have gone on , it 's got a little bit easier because you know what 's coming .
and we have fun - i like a bit of dancing .
samantha : it 's very hectic to prepare the routines because we 've got so many , and especially this week , but it 's all going to be worth it hopefully .
who is your ideal bill sikes ?
jessie : it would be a close competition between johnny depp and james mcavoy because i have an awful soft spot for james mcavoy , he 's like my ideal guy , so if james mcavoy 's out there i 'd just like to say i 'm single at the moment … i 'm only messing .
jodie : ooh , it would have to be gerard butler from -lsb- romantic comedy -rsb- ps i love you .
do n't worry , i 've got a fella , i 'm taken .
samantha : i think johnny depp would be an incredible bill sikes .
obviously , it 's not going to happen but it would be brilliant because he 's good at getting into character roles and i just think he 'd be a really interesting and different bill sikes .
are you nervous at the prospect of possibly sharing the stage with rowan atkinson ?
jessie : what a privilege and opportunity -lsb- it would be -rsb- to play opposite the mr bean because he 's somebody that you watch in cartoons when you 're growing up .
he 's going to be fantastic .
jodie : i do n't want to imagine him as mr bean because i know that 's so far away , but i just think it would be phenomenal .
i 've grown up with him and blackadder and all the films and series he 's done , and it would be an absolute honour to be on stage with him because he 's just fantastic .
samantha : it would be petrifying but so exciting , he 's just such a massive acting figure , he really gets into his characters and he 's really going to be an incredible fagin so that would be a definite challenge to play alongside him .
what have been your best and worst moments on the show ?
jessie : my best was getting into the final 12 when we were in andrew lloyd webber 's house because it was just that feeling of relief , knowing that people like that believe in you .
probably the worst was waiting to hear if i was in the final 12 because i think that day was definitely the most intense that we 've gone through .
jodie : best was the first show because all the girls had worked so hard and it was the highest energy show - i started crying .
i think i 'm so soppy .
and the worst was stepping into the first audition .
i was so scared , i 'd not really sung in two years and i was just going to give it up .
to step into the audition thinking i might not get it .
i used to be 22 stone and that always used to be the fault for that .
but i was just me now and i had nothing to hide behind , so that was really , really tough for me .
samantha : my best was getting to meet idina menzel -lsb- from the musical wicked -rsb- and getting to sing defying gravity , in a way that she 'd helped me with .
and the worst was finding out you 're in the sing-off , that was a hard moment but then the excitement that i was in the final balanced it out so i was fine in the end .
the contestants were interviewed by bbc news entertainment reporter helen bushby .
the final of i 'd do anything is on bbc one on saturday at 1800 bst with the results at 2045 bst .

jessie : it would be a close competition between johnny depp and james mcavoy because i have an awful soft spot for james mcavoy , he 's like my ideal guy , so if james mcavoy 's out there i 'd just like to say i 'm single at the moment … i 'm only messing .
jodie : ooh , it would have to be gerard butler from -lsb- romantic comedy -rsb- ps i love you .
do n't worry , i 've got a fella , i 'm taken .
samantha : i think johnny depp would be an incredible bill sikes .
obviously , it 's not going to happen but it would be brilliant because he 's good at getting into character roles and i just think he 'd be a really interesting and different bill sikes .
are you nervous at the prospect of possibly sharing the stage with rowan atkinson ?
jessie : what a privilege and opportunity -lsb- it would be -rsb- to play opposite the mr bean because he 's somebody that you watch in cartoons when you 're growing up .

jodie : i do n't want to imagine him as mr bean because i know that 's so far away , but i just think it would be phenomenal .
i 've grown up with him and blackadder and all the films and series he 's done , and it would be an absolute honour to be on stage with him because he 's just fantastic .
samantha : it would be petrifying but so exciting , he 's just such a massive acting figure , he really gets into his characters and he 's really going to be an incredible fagin so that would be a definite challenge to play alongside him .
what have been your best and worst moments on the show ?
jessie : my best was getting into the final 12 when we were in andrew lloyd webber 's house because it was just that feeling of relief , knowing that people like that believe in you .
probably the worst was waiting to hear if i was in the final 12 because i think that day was definitely the most intense that we 've gone through .
jodie : best was the first show because all the girls had worked so hard and it was the highest energy show - i started crying .
i think i 'm so soppy .
and the worst was stepping into the first audition .
i was so scared , i 'd not really sung in two years and i was just going to give it up .
to step into the audition thinking i might not get it .
i used to be 22 stone and that always used to be the fault for that .
but i was just me now and i had nothing to hide behind , so that was really , really tough for me .
samantha : my best was getting to meet idina menzel -lsb- from the musical wicked -rsb- and getting to sing defying gravity , in a way that she 'd helped me with .
and the worst was finding out you 're in the sing-off , that was a hard moment but then the excitement that i was in the final balanced it out so i was fine in the end .

the three , who now face the public vote as they bid to play the feisty nancy , talk about nerves , unusual fan mail and their ideal bill sikes .
how nervous are you and why should you win ?
jessie : i 've actually become a professional nail-biter since the competition started and it 's got worse .
but it 's positive nerves and i want this so much i literally would do anything to win .
when something feels so right you just have to go in fighting for it .
jodie : my nerves are the same every week .
my knees knock when i get on the stage , so it is a scary thing .
i 've never done anything like singing on tv ever before and i really hope i do win because i 've wanted it for so , so long .
i 'm ready to put every bit of heart and soul i can muster up into it .
samantha : i 'm really , really nervous for the final .
it 's exciting to think we 've come this far and now it 's a chance for us to say " well this is me " .
i think i am a raw nancy , and i 've definitely come on a massive journey throughout this competition , which is why i think i should get the part .
what will you do if you lose ?
jessie : it 's not going to be the end of the world and i hope that there 's more opportunities out there for me .
this is a career i have a huge passion for and i want to continue what i love doing .
jodie : i 'd go away with the best experience of a lifetime because i 've never been properly trained , so i take away a wealth of knowledge .
samantha : you 've just got to weigh up all the options of what life throws at you , i suppose .
hopefully , i 'll do some work if i can or go and train .
i do n't know , i 'll just have to play it by ear , i think .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement who will be nancy ?
what would you be doing if you had n't entered the contest ?
jessie : i 'd probably be still working as a waitress back in my home town in a small cafe .
i was taking a gap year but hopefully i 'd have been accepted into drama school .
jodie : i set up a company and a group to help people motivate themselves and lose weight so that 's what i 'd still be doing .
i 'd be doing my agony aunt stuff , which i still enjoy .
samantha : i 'd still be at school .
i dropped out to pursue this competition - i was n't going to at first but , as i started getting through the weeks , i had to really .
what sort of support have you had from the public and have you had any unusual fan mail ?
jessie : the public have been fantastic .
the thing people might n't realise is that people back in ireland ca n't vote - it 's the british public who 've kept me in this competition and they 've just been absolutely amazing .
i 've had really , really lovely fan mail from all different ages .
jodie : i 've had the most adorable and humbling letters and , the pictures i 've had from kids , i 've got them all up on my wall .
it 's lovely .
there has n't been a single weird one at all .
samantha : i have n't had strangely unusual fan mail .
i have had some roses and some chocolates from some boys , which was sweet .
i have n't had anything too weird , like a sock or some mittens , which i thought i 'd get because i 'm scared of them .
but i have n't .
so that 's a relief .
what do you think of the judges and do you agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions ?
jessie : i really respect them , they 're all professionals , they 've been in the business for so long and they know what it takes to be a leading lady .
and andrew lloyd webber - i look up to him so much .
any decision that he makes , it 's the right decision at the end of the day .
jodie : i love john and denise , they 're like the perfect mr and mrs. and cameron was lovely when he came on and , well barry 's barry is n't he ?
and you have to agree to a certain extent with andrew because he 's got that wealth of knowledge .
it might not be the person who you want to see go but you have to respect his decision .
samantha : i respect the judges a lot .
so when they give me criticism , i take that on board .
sometimes you do n't agree with andrew lloyd webber 's decisions .
i would hate to be in his position and everyone who goes is kind of the wrong decision in ways , because you ca n't see any of these girls going .
is graham norton funny when the cameras are n't rolling ?
jessie : he 's a laugh-and-a-half but , on and off camera , he 's exactly the same person , he 's got a personality that just shines out and he 's a lovely guy to be around .
jodie : he 's got a heart of gold and a lot of people do n't see that because , i suppose , you just see him presenting .
he 's so caring and he 's got two of the most adorable dogs you have ever seen .
but he 's a lovely , really grounded fella .
samantha : when the cameras are n't on , i was really surprised because he 's so down to earth and chatty , he does actually care about us all individually .
he is really hilarious which i was pleasantly surprised at because most comedians off camera might be a bit dull , but he 's not at all , he 's brilliant .
how hard is it preparing the routines each week ?
jessie : it 's pretty intense - we do work really hard and there 's never a moment where you 'll see us slacking off , because when we 're not training we 're in the toilets practising our songs .
it 's not a chore for us , we love doing it .
jodie : as the weeks have gone on , it 's got a little bit easier because you know what 's coming .
and we have fun - i like a bit of dancing .

the unemployment rate rose to 4 % in april , the highest rate since september and up from 3.8 % the previous month .
other figures showed household spending in april was down 2.7 % on the year before , which was much worse than a predicted fall of 0.9 % .
the annual rate of inflation slowed to 0.9 % in april , but the decline was due to temporary suspension of a fuel tax .
analysts said inflation was set to rebound to about 1.4 % in may .
tough times last month , japan 's central bank cut its growth forecast for the current financial year to 1.5 % from 2.1 % , amid continuing worries about the impact of the us slowdown on global markets .
the increase in the unemployment rate was triggered by job losses among construction firms .
" amid a slump in the economy , conditions of employment are not improving , " said keiji kanda , an economist at think tank daiwa institute of research .
" the number of employees in the manufacturing sector is declining as companies are reluctant to hire people . "
analysts said consumer spending had fallen as people began to tighten purse strings because of rising food and energy prices .
with inflation expected to rebound in may , there is speculation that japanese interest rates may rise from their current level of 0.5 % in the months ahead .
" prices are rising , but we need to note that they are hurting consumer sentiment at the same time , " said takeshi minami , chief economist at norinchukin research institute .
" markets are worried about inflation and talk about a rate hike , but any premature rate rise could bring down the economy , so that should be tackled with a balanced approach . "

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news with hundreds of festivals promising music and mayhem across the uk this summer , the scene appears to be booming .
but has the festival frenzy passed its peak ?
festival fever : every summer is packed with live music events between now and september , each weekend is crammed with dozens of events ranging from mega-gigs to boutique gatherings .
the biggest names - like glastonbury , reading and the v festivals - are well established .
others , like rock ness -lrb- on the banks of loch ness -rrb- , wakestock -lrb- music ' n ' wakeboarding -rrb- and bestival -lrb- nautical fancy dress optional -rrb- are trying to build up to that status .

retrofest is for you .
feel like singing along to your favourite anthems but without the crowds ?
glastonbudget is the place for tribute bands .
it is a far cry from 20 years ago , when there were just two festivals - glastonbury and reading - according to festival republic managing director melvin benn , who now runs both events .
" unquestionably there 's been a boom in festivals , " he says .
" certainly in the last 20 years it 's been very considerable . "
the scene began to grow in the 1990s , he says , and really took off at the turn of the millennium when glastonbury tv coverage took festivals into the front room .
zoo8 fans can watch mark ronson then meet a monkey nicknamed after him more than a million people now go to festivals every year , fuelled by a recent boom in smaller , esoteric and personally-curated festivals , he believes .
" it was a response to what was n't in the market , and what was n't in the market was niche family-friendly festivals and festivals that were medium in size . "
one of the new festivals on this year 's calendar is zoo8 , which will be held in port lympne wild animal park in kent - although the lions and tigers will be well away from the stages .
it is the first festival for organiser matt dice , who wanted to branch out from promoting club nights .
" i 've always wanted to do a big summer outdoor event , " he says .
" there 's a lot of competition out there .
everyone 's fighting for that market but we feel we 've got a unique selling point .
there 's not many festivals you find at a zoo . "

" the hop farm is going to be without sponsorship , without branding , no guest areas .
everybody gets the same treatment and everybody 's looked after the same way .
it 's a sense of inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness . "
there are more than 400 festivals this year , he says - and they are becoming more important for the bands .

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news with hundreds of festivals promising music and mayhem across the uk this summer , the scene appears to be booming .
but has the festival frenzy passed its peak ?
festival fever : every summer is packed with live music events between now and september , each weekend is crammed with dozens of events ranging from mega-gigs to boutique gatherings .
the biggest names - like glastonbury , reading and the v festivals - are well established .
others , like rock ness -lrb- on the banks of loch ness -rrb- , wakestock -lrb- music ' n ' wakeboarding -rrb- and bestival -lrb- nautical fancy dress optional -rrb- are trying to build up to that status .
and many small events have sprung up in recent years , finding new niches to fill - some more personal or sophisticated , others selling themselves on certain themes .
unquestionably there 's been a boom in festivals - in the last 20 years it 's been very considerable melvin benn festival republic fancy a festival in a safari park ?
try zoo8 .
want a weekend of 1980s pop ?
retrofest is for you .
feel like singing along to your favourite anthems but without the crowds ?
glastonbudget is the place for tribute bands .
it is a far cry from 20 years ago , when there were just two festivals - glastonbury and reading - according to festival republic managing director melvin benn , who now runs both events .
" unquestionably there 's been a boom in festivals , " he says .
" certainly in the last 20 years it 's been very considerable . "
the scene began to grow in the 1990s , he says , and really took off at the turn of the millennium when glastonbury tv coverage took festivals into the front room .
zoo8 fans can watch mark ronson then meet a monkey nicknamed after him more than a million people now go to festivals every year , fuelled by a recent boom in smaller , esoteric and personally-curated festivals , he believes .
" it was a response to what was n't in the market , and what was n't in the market was niche family-friendly festivals and festivals that were medium in size . "
one of the new festivals on this year 's calendar is zoo8 , which will be held in port lympne wild animal park in kent - although the lions and tigers will be well away from the stages .
it is the first festival for organiser matt dice , who wanted to branch out from promoting club nights .
" i 've always wanted to do a big summer outdoor event , " he says .
" there 's a lot of competition out there .
everyone 's fighting for that market but we feel we 've got a unique selling point .
there 's not many festivals you find at a zoo . "
another new event is a day at the hop farm , run by former reading boss vince power and headlined by neil young .
because of the way the music business is changing , the festival circuit is the main source of income now for a lot of bands vince power festival promoter " i 've been looking at uk festivals and there seems to be a resentment towards the branding and sponsorship that goes with every festival now , which as far as i 'm concerned does n't have any benefit for the customer , " mr power says .
" the hop farm is going to be without sponsorship , without branding , no guest areas .
everybody gets the same treatment and everybody 's looked after the same way .
it 's a sense of inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness . "
there are more than 400 festivals this year , he says - and they are becoming more important for the bands .
" because of the way the music business is changing , the festival circuit is the main source of income now for a lot of bands . "
glastonbury tickets still have not sold out , eight weeks after going on sale he believes there has been " a huge growth " in festivals over the past few years - but neil greenway , founder of the efestivals.co.uk website , does not agree .
" the peak of the boom was three years ago , " he says .
" it held its own the following year .
last year things fell but it was hidden by the rain , and this year they 've fallen even further .
" people go to festivals for a few years and then they tend to stop doing them .
those ones have moved on and there have n't been the numbers coming through to replace them . "
some events have suffered slower ticket sales this year - notably glastonbury , which still has not sold out eight weeks after going on sale .
the number of festivals being cancelled has also risen , mr greenway says .
" there have been 16 cancelled and we have n't even started yet . "
it 's the generic ones that will have problems - they 're all sharing the same acts neil greenway efestivals.co.uk two of the main casualties - forgotten valley in cumbria and wax : on live in leeds - have both blamed the credit crunch for causing investors to pull out .

" the ones that have a good reputation , are good at what they do and perhaps have a unique selling point will continue to go fairly strong , " mr greenway says .
" it 's the generic ones that will have problems .
they 're all sort of sharing the same acts so in one way a lot of them have got the same line-up .
why should you choose one above the other ? "
mr benn agrees that the market is " saturated " - but he is still planning a new , small-scale event next year .
mr power , meanwhile , is looking to europe for the next phase of growth .
" i was in lithuania looking at a festival , to start one there , " he says .
" they do n't have a festival there .
so maybe we should all go to lithuania . "

it 's a sense of inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness . "
there are more than 400 festivals this year , he says - and they are becoming more important for the bands .
" because of the way the music business is changing , the festival circuit is the main source of income now for a lot of bands . "
he believes there has been " a huge growth " in festivals over the past few years - but neil greenway , founder of the efestivals.co.uk website , does not agree .
" the peak of the boom was three years ago , " he says .
" it held its own the following year .
last year things fell but it was hidden by the rain , and this year they 've fallen even further .
" people go to festivals for a few years and then they tend to stop doing them .
those ones have moved on and there have n't been the numbers coming through to replace them . "
some events have suffered slower ticket sales this year - notably glastonbury , which still has not sold out eight weeks after going on sale .
the number of festivals being cancelled has also risen , mr greenway says .
" there have been 16 cancelled and we have n't even started yet . "
" it 's the generic ones that will have problems - they 're all sharing the same acts " neil greenway efestivals.co.uk two of the main casualties - forgotten valley in cumbria and wax : on live in leeds - have both blamed the credit crunch for causing investors to pull out .
so which events will survive ?
" the ones that have a good reputation , are good at what they do and perhaps have a unique selling point will continue to go fairly strong , " mr greenway says .
" it 's the generic ones that will have problems .
they 're all sort of sharing the same acts so in one way a lot of them have got the same line-up .
why should you choose one above the other ? "
mr benn agrees that the market is " saturated " - but he is still planning a new , small-scale event next year .
mr power , meanwhile , is looking to europe for the next phase of growth .
" i was in lithuania looking at a festival , to start one there , " he says .
" they do n't have a festival there .
so maybe we should all go to lithuania . "
