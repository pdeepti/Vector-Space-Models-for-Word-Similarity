" we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .

hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month .

" it will not assist our bilateral relations .

" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .

jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no signs thus far that contracts and approved deliveries will not be adhered to , " wilhelm said . the telegraph reported friday that fears were mounting that russia could restrict oil deliveries to western europe as soon as monday after reports to this effect had begun circulating in moscow . " it is believed that executives from lead-producer lukoil have been put on weekend alert , " the british daily said . it added that it had been informed by a " high-level business source " the executives had been " told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday . " eu must be clear with russia regarding an emergency meeting on monday of european union heads on the crisis , wilhelm said chancellor angela merkel 's aim was that the summit sent " a clear political signal of determination .

couples also stay together longer before severing the knot . marriage in germany is becoming somewhat more stabile .
last year the number of divorces dropped two percent from 2006 , according to the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
in 2007 , 187,100 couples ended their marriages .
and even when couples did divorce , their marriages lasted longer than previously .
the average marriage lasted nearly 14 years in 2007 , longer than in 1990 when couples stayed together for just over 11 years , signaling a longer term trend . the earlier trend of rising divorce rates seems to have halted .
from 1992 to 2003 the number of break-ups a year had climbed steadily from 135,000 to 214,000 .
after germany was reunified in 1990 , the former east germans experienced a very low number of divorces , but caught up with those in the west by 1997 . only in 2004 did the trend begin to reverse itself and the number of divorces declined .
as in many other countries , it is usually the wife who initiates divorce proceedings .
last year , 55 percent or 103,100 women filed for divorce , whereas only 36 percent of their husbands took the initiative .
in the remaining cases , both partners filed for divorce together . but even before the marriage formally ends , nearly 85 percent of all couples have already been living separately for at least one year .
only in two percent of all cases were couples still living together when they formally divorced .
nearly half of all divorces involved minor children under the age of 18 still living at home .
the number of children affected by divorce has also gone down by 2.5 percent from 148,600 in 2006 to 145,000 last year . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

couples also stay together longer before severing the knot . marriage in germany is becoming somewhat more stabile .
last year the number of divorces dropped two percent from 2006 , according to the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
in 2007 , 187,100 couples ended their marriages .
and even when couples did divorce , their marriages lasted longer than previously .
the average marriage lasted nearly 14 years in 2007 , longer than in 1990 when couples stayed together for just over 11 years , signaling a longer term trend . the earlier trend of rising divorce rates seems to have halted .
from 1992 to 2003 the number of break-ups a year had climbed steadily from 135,000 to 214,000 .
after germany was reunified in 1990 , the former east germans experienced a very low number of divorces , but caught up with those in the west by 1997 . only in 2004 did the trend begin to reverse itself and the number of divorces declined .
as in many other countries , it is usually the wife who initiates divorce proceedings .
last year , 55 percent or 103,100 women filed for divorce , whereas only 36 percent of their husbands took the initiative .
in the remaining cases , both partners filed for divorce together . but even before the marriage formally ends , nearly 85 percent of all couples have already been living separately for at least one year .
only in two percent of all cases were couples still living together when they formally divorced .
nearly half of all divorces involved minor children under the age of 18 still living at home .
the number of children affected by divorce has also gone down by 2.5 percent from 148,600 in 2006 to 145,000 last year . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court entered pleas of not guilty for him . the former bosnian serb leader was told by the judge that pleas of not guilty would be entered by the court on his behalf , in accordance with court rules on friday , aug .
29 .
the tribunal 's next session was set for sept .
17 . " i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court , " karadzic answered to the first charge of genocide , referring to his challenge to the court 's legitimacy .
" this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me . " karadzic stands accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , relating among other things to involvement in an attempt to destroy in whole or in part the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat ethnic groups . karadzic is alleged to have known about crimes including the killing of thousands of civilians in srebrenica in 1995 by bosnian serb forces , and the shelling of sarajevo , killing and terrorizing the city 's civilians . friday 's session of the court in the hague came a month after karadzic first appeared and requested a 30-day postponement to study the indictment . last week , the icty transferred the trial to another chamber , citing " trial management and case distribution needs . " the decision came just days after karadzic asked the court to take dutch judge alphons orie off the case , claiming he would not be neutral . karadzic challenges legality of proceedings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the worst massacre in europe since the end of world war ii karadzic has already said he will defend himself and has called for former us balkans mediator richard holbrooke and ex-secretary of states madeleine albright to appear at the tribunal . the former serb leader had no legal representation for friday 's appearance , but told the judge he would have put together " a team of associates " to assist him by the time the prosecution has amended the indictment - expected to happen next month . he has also questioned the legality of the case being brought against him and says he was offered immunity by holbrooke . now aged 63 , he had been on the run for some 12 years before his arrest on in belgrade on july 21 .
serbian authorities extradited him to the hague on july 30 . he stands accused of ordering the mass killing of men from the eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica .
the massacre resulted in the death of more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys in july 1995 . his top military commander radtko mladic , also implicated in the massacre , is still at large .
however , serbia ’ s top war crimes prosecutor , vladimir vukcevic , said in belgrade on thursday he expected mladic would be arrested soon , but declined to be more precise . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 29.08.2008 analysis : eu 's future as peace broker at stake in caucasus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much hinges on the eu 's emergency meeting on georgia and russia an emergency eu meeting monday in brussels on how to respond to russia 's recognition of the georgian breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia could be instrumental in confirming the eu as a force for peace . with the united states taking a diplomatic back seat on the crisis and the swift reaction by french president nicolas sarkozy , acting as eu president , monday 's summit has become the union 's first opportunity to broker a solution to a major international conflict on its own . but the opportunity is mined with potential pitfalls and risks , not least of which is the traditional eu dilemma of getting a group of 27 nations to agree on a common policy .
and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .
but french officials say that what is at stake today " is more important -lrb- than iraq -rrb- : it is our neighborhood . " its aims will be to show support for georgia , in the form of humanitarian and financial aid , and to force russia to implement , " completely and without fail , " the six-point agreement brokered by sarkozy earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's full withdrawal is a condition of the eu 's plan this includes the immediate removal of russian checkpoints on georgian territory and the retreat of russian forces to pre-conflict positions and allowing the deployment of perhaps hundreds of international observers , under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . in addition , france insists that russia agree to point six of the accord , international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of south ossetia and abkhazia . if moscow does not fully implement the accord , one french official told the dpa news agency , european relations with russia will be " under observation . " external and internal relations on a knife edge all this must be accomplished without doing permanent damage to the relationship between the eu and russia and without letting bloc-internal rifts on the issue sabotage a common position . this delicate balancing act is being complicated by the possibility that several eu members may demand that the union impose sanctions against moscow - a step other eu nations are not ready to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of russia 's neighbors have energy concerns a source in paris said friday that " the time for sanctions has not come , " and noted that the countries that may demand radical action on monday , such as poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , are those most dependent on russian gas supplies . " we are telling these countries , ' think of the russian reply to sanctions , " ' a reference to moscow 's penchant for squeezing gas supplies to underline its political agenda during the winter . divided leaders could lead to divided opinions another complication is the fact that a number of countries will be represented at monday 's summit by two leaders each of whom will represent different policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk , right , and kaczynski do n't see eye to eye polish prime minister donald tusk can be relied on to toe the eu line , while polish president lech kaczynski has said that the polish and baltic stance at the summit " wo n't be completely radical , but radical enough . " in addition , czech president vaclav klaus will be accompanying prime minister mirek topolanek to brussels , and both men have widely diverging opinions on the issue .
it remains to be seen which of these leaders will speak for his country . the summit also takes place under the looming threat of other crises in the region . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has warned that , after georgia , " there will be other aims that one could conceive of being the objectives of russia , particularly crimea , ukraine and moldavia . " the next chapter in what looks to be a long diplomatic story will take place on nov .
14 , when russian leaders meet with their eu counterparts in nice .
that is also , a french official said , a kind of unofficial deadline for moscow to put the six-point plan into effect . in paris , this is viewed as being " of absolutely crucial importance .

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .
but french officials say that what is at stake today " is more important -lrb- than iraq -rrb- : it is our neighborhood .

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .

couples also stay together longer before severing the knot . marriage in germany is becoming somewhat more stabile .
last year the number of divorces dropped two percent from 2006 , according to the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
in 2007 , 187,100 couples ended their marriages .
and even when couples did divorce , their marriages lasted longer than previously .
the average marriage lasted nearly 14 years in 2007 , longer than in 1990 when couples stayed together for just over 11 years , signaling a longer term trend . the earlier trend of rising divorce rates seems to have halted .
from 1992 to 2003 the number of break-ups a year had climbed steadily from 135,000 to 214,000 .
after germany was reunified in 1990 , the former east germans experienced a very low number of divorces , but caught up with those in the west by 1997 . only in 2004 did the trend begin to reverse itself and the number of divorces declined .
as in many other countries , it is usually the wife who initiates divorce proceedings .
last year , 55 percent or 103,100 women filed for divorce , whereas only 36 percent of their husbands took the initiative .
in the remaining cases , both partners filed for divorce together . but even before the marriage formally ends , nearly 85 percent of all couples have already been living separately for at least one year .
only in two percent of all cases were couples still living together when they formally divorced .
nearly half of all divorces involved minor children under the age of 18 still living at home .
the number of children affected by divorce has also gone down by 2.5 percent from 148,600 in 2006 to 145,000 last year . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .

the inflation data published on friday , aug .

analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .

" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "
us refutes allegation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the us using russia 's war with georgia to give one candidate the edge ?
putin went on to speculate about the reason behind what he considers the us ' role in sparking russia 's conflict with georgia , pointing to the presidential election between democrat barack obama and republican john mccain on nov .

" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .

heightening tensions with russia are likely to make us vice president dick cheney 's visit to georgia next week even more sensitive .
cheney is scheduled to visit several countries in the region .
" the overriding priority , especially in baku , tbilisi and kiev , will be the same : a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well-being and security in this part of the world , " john hannah , national security adviser to cheney , told reporters on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me . " karadzic stands accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , relating among other things to involvement in an attempt to destroy in whole or in part the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat ethnic groups . karadzic is alleged to have known about crimes including the killing of thousands of civilians in srebrenica in 1995 by bosnian serb forces , and the shelling of sarajevo , killing and terrorizing the city 's civilians . friday 's session of the court in the hague came a month after karadzic first appeared and requested a 30-day postponement to study the indictment . last week , the icty transferred the trial to another chamber , citing " trial management and case distribution needs . " the decision came just days after karadzic asked the court to take dutch judge alphons orie off the case , claiming he would not be neutral . karadzic challenges legality of proceedings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the worst massacre in europe since the end of world war ii karadzic has already said he will defend himself and has called for former us balkans mediator richard holbrooke and ex-secretary of states madeleine albright to appear at the tribunal . the former serb leader had no legal representation for friday 's appearance , but told the judge he would have put together " a team of associates " to assist him by the time the prosecution has amended the indictment - expected to happen next month . he has also questioned the legality of the case being brought against him and says he was offered immunity by holbrooke . now aged 63 , he had been on the run for some 12 years before his arrest on in belgrade on july 21 .
serbian authorities extradited him to the hague on july 30 . he stands accused of ordering the mass killing of men from the eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica .
the massacre resulted in the death of more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys in july 1995 . his top military commander radtko mladic , also implicated in the massacre , is still at large .
however , serbia ’ s top war crimes prosecutor , vladimir vukcevic , said in belgrade on thursday he expected mladic would be arrested soon , but declined to be more precise . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " .

the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .

" he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks .

" we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .

obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 29.08.2008 wolfgang wagner prepares to relinquish bayreuth control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang will pass the legacy to a new generation of wagners - but which ones ?
it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .
enter stage left ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .

" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .

" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "

" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .

" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 29.08.2008 obama resurrects the spirit of jfk and a new era of camelot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no coincidence that berlin was the only european capital where obama spoke publicly barack obama has been riding the tide of jfk 's popularity both in the us and germany , where the the former us president was once idolized .
endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 .
the tribunal 's next session was set for sept .
17 . " i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court , " karadzic answered to the first charge of genocide , referring to his challenge to the court 's legitimacy .
" this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me . " karadzic stands accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , relating among other things to involvement in an attempt to destroy in whole or in part the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat ethnic groups . karadzic is alleged to have known about crimes including the killing of thousands of civilians in srebrenica in 1995 by bosnian serb forces , and the shelling of sarajevo , killing and terrorizing the city 's civilians . friday 's session of the court in the hague came a month after karadzic first appeared and requested a 30-day postponement to study the indictment . last week , the icty transferred the trial to another chamber , citing " trial management and case distribution needs . " the decision came just days after karadzic asked the court to take dutch judge alphons orie off the case , claiming he would not be neutral . karadzic challenges legality of proceedings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the worst massacre in europe since the end of world war ii karadzic has already said he will defend himself and has called for former us balkans mediator richard holbrooke and ex-secretary of states madeleine albright to appear at the tribunal . the former serb leader had no legal representation for friday 's appearance , but told the judge he would have put together " a team of associates " to assist him by the time the prosecution has amended the indictment - expected to happen next month . he has also questioned the legality of the case being brought against him and says he was offered immunity by holbrooke . now aged 63 , he had been on the run for some 12 years before his arrest on in belgrade on july 21 .
serbian authorities extradited him to the hague on july 30 . he stands accused of ordering the mass killing of men from the eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica .
the massacre resulted in the death of more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys in july 1995 . his top military commander radtko mladic , also implicated in the massacre , is still at large .
however , serbia ’ s top war crimes prosecutor , vladimir vukcevic , said in belgrade on thursday he expected mladic would be arrested soon , but declined to be more precise . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .

they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .
there are now reportedly 2,000 of such structures in germany , as well as 165 traditional mosques . right-wing leaders and extremists from all over europe are planning on meeting sept .

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing .

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "

" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .

they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 29.08.2008 wolfgang wagner prepares to relinquish bayreuth control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang will pass the legacy to a new generation of wagners - but which ones ?
it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .
enter stage left ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing .

german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 29.08.2008 obama resurrects the spirit of jfk and a new era of camelot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no coincidence that berlin was the only european capital where obama spoke publicly barack obama has been riding the tide of jfk 's popularity both in the us and germany , where the the former us president was once idolized .
endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german press review : obama 's presidency not in the bag the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .

katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me . " karadzic stands accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , relating among other things to involvement in an attempt to destroy in whole or in part the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat ethnic groups . karadzic is alleged to have known about crimes including the killing of thousands of civilians in srebrenica in 1995 by bosnian serb forces , and the shelling of sarajevo , killing and terrorizing the city 's civilians . friday 's session of the court in the hague came a month after karadzic first appeared and requested a 30-day postponement to study the indictment . last week , the icty transferred the trial to another chamber , citing " trial management and case distribution needs .

serbian authorities extradited him to the hague on july 30 . he stands accused of ordering the mass killing of men from the eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica .
the massacre resulted in the death of more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys in july 1995 . his top military commander radtko mladic , also implicated in the massacre , is still at large .
however , serbia ’ s top war crimes prosecutor , vladimir vukcevic , said in belgrade on thursday he expected mladic would be arrested soon , but declined to be more precise . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 29.08.2008 wolfgang wagner prepares to relinquish bayreuth control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang will pass the legacy to a new generation of wagners - but which ones ?
it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 29.08.2008 wolfgang wagner prepares to relinquish bayreuth control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang will pass the legacy to a new generation of wagners - but which ones ?
it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "

" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .

analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "
us refutes allegation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the us using russia 's war with georgia to give one candidate the edge ?
putin went on to speculate about the reason behind what he considers the us ' role in sparking russia 's conflict with georgia , pointing to the presidential election between democrat barack obama and republican john mccain on nov .
4 .
" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .
washington swiftly denounced the allegations , calling them " patently false " and " ludicrous . "
russia " needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbor , " said robert wood , state department deputy spokesperson .
cheney 's georgia visit timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is considering scrapping its nuclear cooperation with russia putin 's scathing words came just as the us is considering scrapping a nuclear deal with russia in protest of the nation 's actions in georgia . white house spokesperson dana perino said that halting work on a civilian nuclear cooperation with russia is " under discussion " by the bush administration following moscow 's role in the bloody conflict as well as its recognition of georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as separate states on tuesday , reported afp .
heightening tensions with russia are likely to make us vice president dick cheney 's visit to georgia next week even more sensitive .
cheney is scheduled to visit several countries in the region .
" the overriding priority , especially in baku , tbilisi and kiev , will be the same : a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well-being and security in this part of the world , " john hannah , national security adviser to cheney , told reporters on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .

obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "

for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 29.08.2008 analysis : eu 's future as peace broker at stake in caucasus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much hinges on the eu 's emergency meeting on georgia and russia an emergency eu meeting monday in brussels on how to respond to russia 's recognition of the georgian breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia could be instrumental in confirming the eu as a force for peace . with the united states taking a diplomatic back seat on the crisis and the swift reaction by french president nicolas sarkozy , acting as eu president , monday 's summit has become the union 's first opportunity to broker a solution to a major international conflict on its own . but the opportunity is mined with potential pitfalls and risks , not least of which is the traditional eu dilemma of getting a group of 27 nations to agree on a common policy .
and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .
but french officials say that what is at stake today " is more important -lrb- than iraq -rrb- : it is our neighborhood . " its aims will be to show support for georgia , in the form of humanitarian and financial aid , and to force russia to implement , " completely and without fail , " the six-point agreement brokered by sarkozy earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's full withdrawal is a condition of the eu 's plan this includes the immediate removal of russian checkpoints on georgian territory and the retreat of russian forces to pre-conflict positions and allowing the deployment of perhaps hundreds of international observers , under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . in addition , france insists that russia agree to point six of the accord , international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of south ossetia and abkhazia . if moscow does not fully implement the accord , one french official told the dpa news agency , european relations with russia will be " under observation . " external and internal relations on a knife edge all this must be accomplished without doing permanent damage to the relationship between the eu and russia and without letting bloc-internal rifts on the issue sabotage a common position . this delicate balancing act is being complicated by the possibility that several eu members may demand that the union impose sanctions against moscow - a step other eu nations are not ready to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of russia 's neighbors have energy concerns a source in paris said friday that " the time for sanctions has not come , " and noted that the countries that may demand radical action on monday , such as poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , are those most dependent on russian gas supplies . " we are telling these countries , ' think of the russian reply to sanctions , " ' a reference to moscow 's penchant for squeezing gas supplies to underline its political agenda during the winter . divided leaders could lead to divided opinions another complication is the fact that a number of countries will be represented at monday 's summit by two leaders each of whom will represent different policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk , right , and kaczynski do n't see eye to eye polish prime minister donald tusk can be relied on to toe the eu line , while polish president lech kaczynski has said that the polish and baltic stance at the summit " wo n't be completely radical , but radical enough . " in addition , czech president vaclav klaus will be accompanying prime minister mirek topolanek to brussels , and both men have widely diverging opinions on the issue .
it remains to be seen which of these leaders will speak for his country . the summit also takes place under the looming threat of other crises in the region . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has warned that , after georgia , " there will be other aims that one could conceive of being the objectives of russia , particularly crimea , ukraine and moldavia . " the next chapter in what looks to be a long diplomatic story will take place on nov .
14 , when russian leaders meet with their eu counterparts in nice .
that is also , a french official said , a kind of unofficial deadline for moscow to put the six-point plan into effect . in paris , this is viewed as being " of absolutely crucial importance .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "
us refutes allegation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the us using russia 's war with georgia to give one candidate the edge ?
putin went on to speculate about the reason behind what he considers the us ' role in sparking russia 's conflict with georgia , pointing to the presidential election between democrat barack obama and republican john mccain on nov .
4 .
" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .
washington swiftly denounced the allegations , calling them " patently false " and " ludicrous . "
russia " needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbor , " said robert wood , state department deputy spokesperson .
cheney 's georgia visit timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is considering scrapping its nuclear cooperation with russia putin 's scathing words came just as the us is considering scrapping a nuclear deal with russia in protest of the nation 's actions in georgia . white house spokesperson dana perino said that halting work on a civilian nuclear cooperation with russia is " under discussion " by the bush administration following moscow 's role in the bloody conflict as well as its recognition of georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as separate states on tuesday , reported afp .
heightening tensions with russia are likely to make us vice president dick cheney 's visit to georgia next week even more sensitive .
cheney is scheduled to visit several countries in the region .
" the overriding priority , especially in baku , tbilisi and kiev , will be the same : a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well-being and security in this part of the world , " john hannah , national security adviser to cheney , told reporters on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month .

" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- .

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .

last year the number of divorces dropped two percent from 2006 , according to the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
in 2007 , 187,100 couples ended their marriages .
and even when couples did divorce , their marriages lasted longer than previously .
the average marriage lasted nearly 14 years in 2007 , longer than in 1990 when couples stayed together for just over 11 years , signaling a longer term trend . the earlier trend of rising divorce rates seems to have halted .

as in many other countries , it is usually the wife who initiates divorce proceedings .
last year , 55 percent or 103,100 women filed for divorce , whereas only 36 percent of their husbands took the initiative .
in the remaining cases , both partners filed for divorce together . but even before the marriage formally ends , nearly 85 percent of all couples have already been living separately for at least one year .
only in two percent of all cases were couples still living together when they formally divorced .
nearly half of all divorces involved minor children under the age of 18 still living at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 29.08.2008 obama resurrects the spirit of jfk and a new era of camelot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no coincidence that berlin was the only european capital where obama spoke publicly barack obama has been riding the tide of jfk 's popularity both in the us and germany , where the the former us president was once idolized .
endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german press review : obama 's presidency not in the bag the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .

in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.08.2008 russia rejects western criticism but commits to g8 , wto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hosted the g8 conference just two years ago russia rejected the criticism of fellow g8 members as biased , saying it was orchestrated to justify georgian " aggression . "
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .

" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 29.08.2008 analysis : eu 's future as peace broker at stake in caucasus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much hinges on the eu 's emergency meeting on georgia and russia an emergency eu meeting monday in brussels on how to respond to russia 's recognition of the georgian breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia could be instrumental in confirming the eu as a force for peace . with the united states taking a diplomatic back seat on the crisis and the swift reaction by french president nicolas sarkozy , acting as eu president , monday 's summit has become the union 's first opportunity to broker a solution to a major international conflict on its own . but the opportunity is mined with potential pitfalls and risks , not least of which is the traditional eu dilemma of getting a group of 27 nations to agree on a common policy .
and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .
but french officials say that what is at stake today " is more important -lrb- than iraq -rrb- : it is our neighborhood . " its aims will be to show support for georgia , in the form of humanitarian and financial aid , and to force russia to implement , " completely and without fail , " the six-point agreement brokered by sarkozy earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's full withdrawal is a condition of the eu 's plan this includes the immediate removal of russian checkpoints on georgian territory and the retreat of russian forces to pre-conflict positions and allowing the deployment of perhaps hundreds of international observers , under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . in addition , france insists that russia agree to point six of the accord , international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of south ossetia and abkhazia . if moscow does not fully implement the accord , one french official told the dpa news agency , european relations with russia will be " under observation . " external and internal relations on a knife edge all this must be accomplished without doing permanent damage to the relationship between the eu and russia and without letting bloc-internal rifts on the issue sabotage a common position . this delicate balancing act is being complicated by the possibility that several eu members may demand that the union impose sanctions against moscow - a step other eu nations are not ready to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of russia 's neighbors have energy concerns a source in paris said friday that " the time for sanctions has not come , " and noted that the countries that may demand radical action on monday , such as poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , are those most dependent on russian gas supplies . " we are telling these countries , ' think of the russian reply to sanctions , " ' a reference to moscow 's penchant for squeezing gas supplies to underline its political agenda during the winter . divided leaders could lead to divided opinions another complication is the fact that a number of countries will be represented at monday 's summit by two leaders each of whom will represent different policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk , right , and kaczynski do n't see eye to eye polish prime minister donald tusk can be relied on to toe the eu line , while polish president lech kaczynski has said that the polish and baltic stance at the summit " wo n't be completely radical , but radical enough . " in addition , czech president vaclav klaus will be accompanying prime minister mirek topolanek to brussels , and both men have widely diverging opinions on the issue .
it remains to be seen which of these leaders will speak for his country . the summit also takes place under the looming threat of other crises in the region . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has warned that , after georgia , " there will be other aims that one could conceive of being the objectives of russia , particularly crimea , ukraine and moldavia . " the next chapter in what looks to be a long diplomatic story will take place on nov .
14 , when russian leaders meet with their eu counterparts in nice .
that is also , a french official said , a kind of unofficial deadline for moscow to put the six-point plan into effect . in paris , this is viewed as being " of absolutely crucial importance .

and because the policy involves russia , the potential for disagreement is enormous . according to a french government source , success will depend on sarkozy 's ability to negotiate and , especially , on the ability of the union to speak with one voice . the emergency summit is the first such meeting called since the 2003 iraq war .
but french officials say that what is at stake today " is more important -lrb- than iraq -rrb- : it is our neighborhood . " its aims will be to show support for georgia , in the form of humanitarian and financial aid , and to force russia to implement , " completely and without fail , " the six-point agreement brokered by sarkozy earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's full withdrawal is a condition of the eu 's plan this includes the immediate removal of russian checkpoints on georgian territory and the retreat of russian forces to pre-conflict positions and allowing the deployment of perhaps hundreds of international observers , under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . in addition , france insists that russia agree to point six of the accord , international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of south ossetia and abkhazia . if moscow does not fully implement the accord , one french official told the dpa news agency , european relations with russia will be " under observation . " external and internal relations on a knife edge all this must be accomplished without doing permanent damage to the relationship between the eu and russia and without letting bloc-internal rifts on the issue sabotage a common position . this delicate balancing act is being complicated by the possibility that several eu members may demand that the union impose sanctions against moscow - a step other eu nations are not ready to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of russia 's neighbors have energy concerns a source in paris said friday that " the time for sanctions has not come , " and noted that the countries that may demand radical action on monday , such as poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , are those most dependent on russian gas supplies . " we are telling these countries , ' think of the russian reply to sanctions , " ' a reference to moscow 's penchant for squeezing gas supplies to underline its political agenda during the winter . divided leaders could lead to divided opinions another complication is the fact that a number of countries will be represented at monday 's summit by two leaders each of whom will represent different policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk , right , and kaczynski do n't see eye to eye polish prime minister donald tusk can be relied on to toe the eu line , while polish president lech kaczynski has said that the polish and baltic stance at the summit " wo n't be completely radical , but radical enough . " in addition , czech president vaclav klaus will be accompanying prime minister mirek topolanek to brussels , and both men have widely diverging opinions on the issue .
it remains to be seen which of these leaders will speak for his country . the summit also takes place under the looming threat of other crises in the region . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has warned that , after georgia , " there will be other aims that one could conceive of being the objectives of russia , particularly crimea , ukraine and moldavia . " the next chapter in what looks to be a long diplomatic story will take place on nov .
14 , when russian leaders meet with their eu counterparts in nice .

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks .

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said .

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "
us refutes allegation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the us using russia 's war with georgia to give one candidate the edge ?
putin went on to speculate about the reason behind what he considers the us ' role in sparking russia 's conflict with georgia , pointing to the presidential election between democrat barack obama and republican john mccain on nov .
4 .
" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .
washington swiftly denounced the allegations , calling them " patently false " and " ludicrous . "
russia " needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbor , " said robert wood , state department deputy spokesperson .
cheney 's georgia visit timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is considering scrapping its nuclear cooperation with russia putin 's scathing words came just as the us is considering scrapping a nuclear deal with russia in protest of the nation 's actions in georgia . white house spokesperson dana perino said that halting work on a civilian nuclear cooperation with russia is " under discussion " by the bush administration following moscow 's role in the bloody conflict as well as its recognition of georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as separate states on tuesday , reported afp .
heightening tensions with russia are likely to make us vice president dick cheney 's visit to georgia next week even more sensitive .
cheney is scheduled to visit several countries in the region .
" the overriding priority , especially in baku , tbilisi and kiev , will be the same : a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well-being and security in this part of the world , " john hannah , national security adviser to cheney , told reporters on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .
29 , claimed that " someone in the us specially created this conflict , " reported afp news agency .
the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .
in an interview with cnn , putin pointed to the fact that us citizens were in the conflict area when the hostilities in georgia erupted .
" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "
us refutes allegation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the us using russia 's war with georgia to give one candidate the edge ?
putin went on to speculate about the reason behind what he considers the us ' role in sparking russia 's conflict with georgia , pointing to the presidential election between democrat barack obama and republican john mccain on nov .
4 .
" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .
washington swiftly denounced the allegations , calling them " patently false " and " ludicrous . "
russia " needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbor , " said robert wood , state department deputy spokesperson .
cheney 's georgia visit timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is considering scrapping its nuclear cooperation with russia putin 's scathing words came just as the us is considering scrapping a nuclear deal with russia in protest of the nation 's actions in georgia . white house spokesperson dana perino said that halting work on a civilian nuclear cooperation with russia is " under discussion " by the bush administration following moscow 's role in the bloody conflict as well as its recognition of georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as separate states on tuesday , reported afp .
heightening tensions with russia are likely to make us vice president dick cheney 's visit to georgia next week even more sensitive .
cheney is scheduled to visit several countries in the region .
" the overriding priority , especially in baku , tbilisi and kiev , will be the same : a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well-being and security in this part of the world , " john hannah , national security adviser to cheney , told reporters on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .

" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .

he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .

for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .

kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.08.2008 euro zone inflation drops after fall in oil price großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fall in inflation challenges remain for the ecb new data showed that , after a fall in the price of oil , inflation in the 15 euro zone countries dropped to 3.8 percent in august from 4 percent in july . the fall in oil prices raised the prospects that consumer prices might have peaked , which would help ease pressure on the european central bank .
" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .

the court entered pleas of not guilty for him . the former bosnian serb leader was told by the judge that pleas of not guilty would be entered by the court on his behalf , in accordance with court rules on friday , aug .
29 .
the tribunal 's next session was set for sept .
17 . " i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court , " karadzic answered to the first charge of genocide , referring to his challenge to the court 's legitimacy .
" this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me . " karadzic stands accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , relating among other things to involvement in an attempt to destroy in whole or in part the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat ethnic groups . karadzic is alleged to have known about crimes including the killing of thousands of civilians in srebrenica in 1995 by bosnian serb forces , and the shelling of sarajevo , killing and terrorizing the city 's civilians . friday 's session of the court in the hague came a month after karadzic first appeared and requested a 30-day postponement to study the indictment . last week , the icty transferred the trial to another chamber , citing " trial management and case distribution needs . " the decision came just days after karadzic asked the court to take dutch judge alphons orie off the case , claiming he would not be neutral . karadzic challenges legality of proceedings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the worst massacre in europe since the end of world war ii karadzic has already said he will defend himself and has called for former us balkans mediator richard holbrooke and ex-secretary of states madeleine albright to appear at the tribunal . the former serb leader had no legal representation for friday 's appearance , but told the judge he would have put together " a team of associates " to assist him by the time the prosecution has amended the indictment - expected to happen next month . he has also questioned the legality of the case being brought against him and says he was offered immunity by holbrooke . now aged 63 , he had been on the run for some 12 years before his arrest on in belgrade on july 21 .
serbian authorities extradited him to the hague on july 30 . he stands accused of ordering the mass killing of men from the eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica .
the massacre resulted in the death of more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys in july 1995 . his top military commander radtko mladic , also implicated in the massacre , is still at large .
however , serbia ’ s top war crimes prosecutor , vladimir vukcevic , said in belgrade on thursday he expected mladic would be arrested soon , but declined to be more precise . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it faces strong competition from the us and italy . a tragic story of love , money and death that is set in the poor , north-eastern part of germany , " jerichow " shines with brilliant acting , especially by nina hoss , who has worked with petzold before . how will the venice jury , led by german filmmaker wim wenders , receive this intimate study of calculation , passion and longing ? the film opens as thomas -lrb- benno fuermann -rrb- , an angular , laconic ex-soldier who has been dishonorably discharged , arrives in the depressed prignitz region . hopeless love affair he strikes up a friendship with ali -lrb- hilmi soezer -rrb- , a turkish immigrant who has achieved prosperity as the owner of 45 snack bars . thomas falls in love with ali 's wife , laura -lrb- nina hoss -rrb- .
petzold captures the ensuing entanglements in both quiet takes and loud scenes as the protagonists perform their impossible tightrope walk amid a land of hopelessness . " you ca n't love each other when you 've got no money , " says laura disconsolately of her dead-end affair with thomas . she is financially dependent on mistrustful , terminally ill ali , who remarks : " i live in a country that does n't want me , with a woman that i bought . " as in his earlier films " yella " and " the state i am in " -lrb- " die innere sicherheit " -rrb- petzold , 47 , explores the frontier between life and death . looming larger in " jerichow , " however , is unfulfilled - and unfulfillable - longing .
in petzold 's view , when men like ali build themselves a " home , " it often becomes a " maximum security unit " for women . home advantage for italian films while none of the four italian films in competition have been shown yet , sandro bondi , italy 's culture minister , countered criticism of the high number by the hamburg-based news magazine der spiegel . " home field advantage , " bondi quipped . he defended the festival 's artistic director , marco mueller , saying that mueller had been " absolutely independent " in choosing this year 's line-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer 's life has been made into a documentary for years , bondi noted , the major film nation italy had taken flak for being conspicuous by its absence at the lido .
after the country 's successes at the latest festival in cannes , he said , it was only natural that italy be well represented in venice . " the world loves italy and its cinema , " he declared . and its fashion .
" valentino : the last emperor , " a documentary by vanity fair editor matt tyrnauer on the italian designer , created a stir thursday .
it puts a spotlight on the glamour and skill of the haute couture czar . an exclusive fashion party dedicated to valentino was planned in the evening at venice 's peggy guggenheim foundation - with eagerly awaited film stars gwyneth paltrow and uma thurman . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .
there are now reportedly 2,000 of such structures in germany , as well as 165 traditional mosques . right-wing leaders and extremists from all over europe are planning on meeting sept .

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but moscow also said it aimed to keep its spot among the world 's top industrialized nations . g7 foreign ministers this week condemned the recognition of georgia 's separatist regions as a violation of the former soviet state 's sovereignty .
" the claim alleging that russia 's decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination , " the russian foreign ministry said friday , aug .
29 , in a statement posted on its web site .
the statement reiterated moscow 's grievance that its position in the conflict has been ignored by the international community and western media .
russia has thrown more punches at the west since being ostracized by the international community over its military foray into georgia .
as tempers flared , russia 's powerful ex-president vladimir putin accused the united states of plotting the conflict to sweeten political campaign battles at home .
he said russia 's continued cooperation on trade and security issues were in jeopardy .
but the foreign ministry statement friday also struck a compromising note , saying it was " ready for open and sincere exchanges . "
" russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group , " the ministry 's statement said .
the group of eight , besides russia , includes the g7 group of the world 's leading industrial nations : the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada .
warning from the us last week , the united states warned that russia 's involvement in the g8 and its bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- was at risk because of its military operations in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gutierrez said the ball was now in russia 's court us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez told germany 's spiegel magazine that russia was " maneuvering itself into an extremely difficult situation . "
" the president has made it clear several times : until now , america was russia 's advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community , " gutierrez told the magazine .
" we included russia in the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialised nations .
we welcomed and pushed forward russia 's desire to join the world trade organisation .
that is all at risk now , " gutierrez said .
us president george w. bush said earlier this month the fighting in south ossetia was hurting russia 's efforts to join modern global economic and security institutions .
gutierrez had previously said russia still had work to do before it was ready to join the wto , but played down any connection between its military action in georgia and its 15-year-old membership bid .
georgia was already blocking formal talks on russian accession to the world trade body because of moscow 's support for the country 's separatist regions .
under wto rules a candidate country must reach agreement with all 153 members , represented by a working party which any existing member can join , as well as agree to separate bilateral deals with any member that seeks them .
russia , the world 's 10th largest economy , is by far the biggest country still outside the wto .
when asked whether russia should be excluded from the g8 and barred from the wto , gutierrez said : " in this crisis situation we ca n't start taking options off the table ...
the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are . "
putin : russia does n't need the wto earlier this week , prime minister vladimir putin said russia saw no advantages to wto membership and should freeze some commitments made during entry talks in a sign moscow was pulling further away from the west after its war in georgia .
putin , quoted by russian news agencies during a government meeting , said russia 's economy would incur a heavy burden in meeting world trade organisation membership requirements and that some of these demands were against the country 's interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said russia saw no advantage of having wto membership " we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession , but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation , " putin said .
" we do n't feel or see any advantages from membership , if they exist at all .
but we are carrying the burden , " he said .
agriculture was particularly affected , putin added .
analysts say excluding russia from the wto and g8 would have little impact on moscow 's current course .
" a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 .
they are past that now , " janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies think-tank told reuters news agency .
saakashvili : russia has destroyed european order meanwhile , georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili told german public radio on friday that russia 's actions in georgia had destroyed the order in europe established after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says the post-wwii order is in tatters saakashvili warned that russia would be emboldened by its military success .
" they are not going to stop here , " he said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" what russia has done undermines and destroys the whole post-cold war , post-second world war european order . "
it was the first time since then that a european power had sought to annex territory in a neighboring country .
russia had seen georgia as vulnerable , as it was not under the shield of nato , saakashvili said , in a clear appeal for his country to be allowed to join the western military alliance .
georgia would not willingly have taken on a nuclear power with a population of 146 million , he said .
saakashvili also called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to georgia and appealed to the european union to assist with reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press stressed that , although he may have made history , the contest for president remains open after barack obama 's speech at the democratic convention in denver , citing a variety of obstacles . the local daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote on friday , aug .
29 , that obama has not yet secured passage to the white house : " the democrats have written a piece of history .
with barack obama , a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house … as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech , and sows aggression in his political rivals , the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness .
whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year-old senator remains open until nov .
4 . "
obama 's " personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him , " reported liberal daily the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" for a while barack obama has been , nationally and globally , the bearer of hope for everything and everyone .
he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises , with bullet points and footnotes , that run above party lines .
he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world .
no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity .
back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there .
since everyone is staring at obama , george w. bush is creeping to the sidelines . "
neue osnabruecker zeitung drew attention to what it saw as other risks of obama 's historic speech in denver : " look here , we have done it - now black people all over the country can cheer .
for obama this triumph is highly risky .
after all , he eventually hopes to become president of all americans , regardless of their skin color .
the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached : workers , owners of small businesses , middle-class families .
above all they are concerned about their jobs .
in these areas of society a candidate can not give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices . "
" it should really have dampened moods in the democratic headquarters that mccain hardly lost ground during the denver spectacle , " wrote dusseldorf 's westdeutsche zeitung .
" mccain is showing that he is not entirely for " more of the same " and moreover he is selling the people the illusion that as " world policeman " he is in even more of a position to throw his weight around than bush , although the democrats controlled the headlines and tv broadcasts .
the competition for the white house is therefore much more open than obama 's hard earned head-start in the early days would suggest .
nov .
4 will show us whether it is indeed still too early for the first black us president . " dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de in denver , german social democrats listen to obama and learn currently in denver to get some strategy lessons from the democratic national convention , a top official for germany 's social democrats told dw that he 's also there to see what an obama victory would mean for germany .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .

it was a fitting final curtain for wolfgang wagner 's career as the man in charge of the bayreuth opera festival as richard wagner 's last opera " parsifal " signaled the end of his 57-year reign . thursday 's closing performance of the 2008 bayreuth festival , the world 's oldest and most prestigious summer music event , brought the 88-year-old wagner to the brink of tears as he took in the dying strains of " parsifal " in the surroundings in which he has spent over half a century battling to preserve his family 's legacy .
wolfgang has ruled bayreuth with an iron hand ever since his brother and organizing partner wieland died in 1966 leaving him in sole charge .
wagner 's tenure officially comes to an end on saturday , one day ahead of his 89th birthday , and a board of directors will then convene two days later to begin the much talked about process of who will succeed him .
just as " parsifal " is about the quest of the knights of the holy grail for a savior , so too is bayreuth in need of a new leader with fresh vision and new ideas to steer it out of long years of artistic and creative stagnation .
even his fiercest critics acknowledge that wolfgang helped make bayreuth what it is today , but many observers agree that his ruthless determination to hold on to power has contributed to the festival 's artistic ossification .
the need and desire for reinvention has spawned an internecine feud more worthy of soap opera than classical opera .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wagner cheered the performance with his daughter eva , one of the contenders in what has become a saga fitting of the family 's association with dramatic spectacle , the succession to the bayreuth throne has pitted ambitious family members against each other in often bitter competition .
when the festival 's ruling body , the so-called stiftungsrat , meets on sept .
1 to decide who will take over from wolfgang , they will assess an application from katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier - both wolfgang 's daughters by different marriages - and a rival bid from wolfgang 's niece nike wagner in tandem with the belgian opera impresario and paris opera chief , gerard mortier .
katharina and eva 's joint leadership bid looked to have succeeded until recently , in spite of the estranged half-sisters ' often fraught relationship .
but with a last-minute application by nike and mortier , the succession process has once more been thrown into turmoil .
according to the statutes of the festival , founded by richard wagner in 1876 , control must remain in the hands of the composer 's descendants , unless there are no suitable candidates .
with the iron grip of wolfgang now torn from the festival 's reins , it will once again be every wagner for herself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

endorsements from the kennedys give obama 's candidacy even greater legitimacy . in june 1963 , former us president john f. kennedy stood before a crowd of 120,000 ecstatic berliners and gave his legendary " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
the berlin wall had gone up two years before , dividing the city along cold war lines , and kennedy was expressing his solidarity with the people of free west berlin . the kennedy aura resonates more deeply in germany than in the united states , according to dieter dettke , a georgetown university professor of us-european relations , who was for many years the washington-based head of germany 's social democrat think tank , the friedrich ebert foundation .
during a tour of european capitals last july , it is no coincidence that the only public speech that barack obama gave was also in the german capital , said dettke . " there are several components to the kennedy myth , " he said .
" his youthful appeal , the break with the past .
old america then was looking for a breath of fresh air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. kennedy throws his full support behind obama back then , an america in which whites and blacks had been segregated in some states was struggling to overcome division across racial lines .
today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today the schism is more a socio-economic divide , but in both cases , the country was looking for a way to face the challenges it was confronted with . kennedy clan endorsement even the kennedy clan has said it sees parallels between jfk and obama , who has been dubbed the " black kennedy " by the german media . it was caroline kennedy , the 50-year-old daughter of the slain president , who first endorsed obama in a new york times commentary in january .
kennedy , who has previously shunned the political spotlight , then made a public appearance at a huge campaign rally at the american university in washington . she said that for the first time in her life she had seen a man like her father . " barack obama is already inspiring all americans , young and old to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals , ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace , and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things , " said kennedy in a speech at the rally . the dream lives on caroline kennedy was not alone , but accompanied by her uncle senator edward m. kennedy , who also endorsed the obama candidacy in a rousing speech back then . on monday at the democratic convention floor in denver , the same scenario was repeated . the 76-year-old senator from massachusetts , one of the most influential and long-serving american politicians of all time , who recently underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour , used his authority to throw his full support behind barack obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline kennedy -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- openly endorses obama obama represents a new generation of leadership in america , said the senator .
" the work begins anew , the hope rises again and the dream lives on , " he said before a cheering crowd . and so the era of camelot , the legendary tale of king arthur that defined jfk 's 1,000 days in office , has been transported chicago , the constituency base of barack obama , the junior senator from illinois . but how much does the white irish catholic kennedy clan have in common with the black messiah obama ?
jfk had also been the first catholic us president ever , just as obama now is the first black man to emerge as the democratic candidate for the presidency . when kennedy took the oath of office , he was just 43 , even a few years younger than 47-year-old obama .
kennedy , however , had been a highly decorated war veteran and had already served for 14 years in congress , where his travels had taken him to europe , asia and the middle east . jfk as a role model even then , kennedy was a blank page for the american public , according to jackson janes , the executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university . " kennedy was more about style than substance back then in 1960 , " said janes .
is obama pursuing the right strategy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk before him , obama drew enthusiastic crowds in berlin " yes , but i think he should n't go too far with it , since lots of people also regard the -lrb- kennedy -rrb- era as a unique time in history , " he said . obama , like bill clinton before him , has repeatedly talked about john f. kennedy being his great role model . as president of the united states of america , he would seek to emulate jfk 's leadership style , said obama .
now as the official democratic party candidate , barack obama is one step closer to his goal . suppressing the dark side of camelot what remains unaccounted for is the " kennedy curse " - all the tragedies that have made one of america 's first families larger than life .
john f. kennedy and his younger brother robert were both gunned down by assassins and three of their sons also succumbed to unnatural deaths at an early age . then there were the kennedy brothers ' dalliances with women other than their wives , jfk 's health problems and the scandals that have tarnished the clan - the dark side of camelot that the democrats would rather not think about at the moment . christina bergmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .
there are now reportedly 2,000 of such structures in germany , as well as 165 traditional mosques . right-wing leaders and extremists from all over europe are planning on meeting sept .

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .

they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .

the white house dismissed the allegation as " patently false . " russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday , aug .

the accusation came as tensions between russia and the us continue to mount .

" it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders , " he said .
" the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army . "

" if my guess is right , then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states , " he said .

" that is a big decline , " said klaus baader , merrill lynch 's london based chief european economist .
" it is astonishing how rapidly the fall in oil prices has fed through to inflation . "
the inflation data published on friday , aug .
29 , follows the release of data earlier this week showing inflation in key economies starting to ease with a slide from 3.3 percent in july to 3.1 percent in august in germany .
analysts had expected the european union 's statistics office 's preliminary inflation data to show consumer prices in the euro zone coming in at 3.9 percent this month .
this came after a decrease in oil prices in recent weeks from record highs of around $ 150 a barrel -lrb- 102 euros -rrb- to below $ 120 -lrb- 81 euros -rrb- .
challenges ahead for euro zone however , the data also revealed further signs of the low consumer confidence currently prevailing in the euro zone , with the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment survey for the currency bloc falling more than expected to 88.8 points in august .
" the low level of the indicator suggests that industrial activity remains subdued , " the commission said .
yet it is the first time in a year that the commision 's consumer indicator has risen , which suggests that the drop in oil prices and the release of national euro zone data showing inflation edging down in several euro zone states appears to have helped improve the mood .
the ecb is expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting next week as it attempts to size up the economic fallout from shrinking growth and high inflation .
but inflation still remains at almost double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent , " with recent warnings from key members of the frankfurt-based central bank of the threat posed by resurgent inflation .
in particular , some of the ecb 's 21 member rate-setting council have expressed concerns about the risks of high inflation fuelling so-called second-round effects of rising prices , triggering demands for higher wages .
evidence of inflationary pressures emerging in the euro zone prompted the ecb to raise rates for the first time in more than a year in july , with the bank raising its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent .
the ecb still faces the problem of the credit crunch and slowing global growth having helped to push several economies such as spain , ireland and italy to the brink of recession . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came as human rights bodies called attention to a potential humanitarian disaster and evidence of ethnic violence during the war . in the latest sign of deteriorating relations in the caucasus , georgia will withdraw its diplomats from moscow , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday , aug .
29 . " within the coming days , georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow , " the head of the foreign ministry 's press department , khatuna iosava told reporters .
" consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained .
it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations , not a complete cut . " georgia had already pulled all but two of its diplomats from its embassy in moscow earlier in the week .
hundreds of thousands of georgians live in russia and cutting diplomatic ties would have left them without consular services , a scenario they now face . the move prompted the russians to claim they had no other choice but to follow suit and close their consulate in tbilisi , the state news agency ria novosti reported .
officials in moscow were quoted as saying that the georgian move was unhelpful and would not ease the crisis between the two countries caused by the war earlier this month . " we regret this step from the georgian side , " russian foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said , quoted by interfax news agency .
" it will not assist our bilateral relations . " georgia 's parliament on thursday unanimously approved a resolution that " orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation " because of russia 's " occupation of georgian territory . " it also declared all russian troops , including those deemed peacekeepers by moscow , to be part of occupying armed forces . moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from georgia last week under a french-brokered cease-fire agreement , but thousands of russian troops remain deployed in the two rebel regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and in a " buffer zone " around them . eu observers to report on broken cease-fire agreement bildunterschrift : some russian troops have pulled out of georgia but those which remain have dug in however , eu fact finders are expected to report back to the european union that russia is still in violation of the cease-fire deal . anne-marie lizin , a belgian senator and part of a group responsible for presenting a report to kouchner ahead of monday 's eu summit , told journalists that russian " peacekeepers " had expanded the buffer zone around the disputed south ossetia region by at least 15 kilometers -lrb- nine miles -rrb- . " we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places , " she said .
" they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before monday 's summit . " another member of the delegation , parliament deputy jean-louis crucke , said the russian presence seemed incompatible with peacekeeping . " it 's not a control , not a checkpoint - it 's a camp , " he said . lizin said russian president dmitry medvedev credibility was on the line after having signed a peace plan requiring russian and georgian forces to pull back to positions held before the fighting earlier this month . the parliamentarians said they would recommend the eu take measures to support georgia . " we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa-free travel is one of these , " said lizin , who is also vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly . humanitarian crisis on the brink of unfolding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have been displaced by the short war while feuding diplomats on both sides argued over the semantics of the fallout from the brief but bloody conflict , a european human rights envoy said on friday that the war had provided a cover for rampant looting and that a humanitarian disaster could be unfolding behind the rhetoric and disagreements . the fighting had displaced thousands of civilians , with ethnic ossetians fleeing to russia and ethnic georgians fleeing from south ossetia , said thomas hammarberg , the council of europe 's human rights commissioner . he added that russia 's recognition of georgia 's rebel regions as independent states this week was also " complicating humanitarian efforts and the -lrb- refugees ' -rrb- right to return " . " have political moves disturbed human rights efforts ?
the answer is ' yes , " ' hammarberg said at a news conference in moscow .
" i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations . " he added that authorities must calm conditions on the ground so people in hiding and those who fled their homes would feel safe returning . " there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands , " hammarberg said .
" my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict . " hammarberg said his other main concern was the lawlessness that had gripped some areas on the conflict zone since the cessation of hostilities . " there is what i call a policing vacuum , not least around tskhinvali and gori , which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes , " he said . images of targeted ethnic violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images are not needed to see the devastation in addition , human rights watch revealed that destruction in villages around tskhinvali was caused by intentional burning - not armed combat . satellite images obtained by the united nations and reports from researchers show that ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia were deliberately torched , human rights watch said . " human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area , " said rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division of human rights watch .
" these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks . " hammarberg , who helped broker the handover of 89 prisoners by south ossetian and georgian authorities earlier this week , said the fact that his intervention was required showed the complete lack of mutual trust that had to be addressed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians hope the structure 's glass design and bilingual program will help integrate the islamic community . cologne 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party all voted for the construction of the mosque , which will include two minarets that stretch 55 meters -lrb- 180 feet -rrb- into the sky , the associated press reported . mayor fritz schramma was the only christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member to approve the plans .
the rest of his party has criticized the mosque 's design as being " too imposing . " builders from the governing body of the turkish-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- will construct the structure with a 37-meter high dome in the city district of ehrenfeld . hot topic of debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration in germany is a controversial topic the mosque has been the subject of great controversy since its early design phase .
german author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano has called it " a power demonstration of islam , " while others view the modern construction as a step towards eventual harmony between muslims and germans . right-of-center german groups had campaigned against the mosque .
they charged that it would bring a " foreign " touch to a city skyline dominated by cologne 's 11th-century catholic cathedral . the ditib and the city have agreed upon the mosque 's pivotal role in achieving integration and believe that offering a german program including language lessons is a critical step . schramma added that sermons delivered within the mosque would be translated . " we want to know what is being done at the mosque , what is being said , preached and taught , " he says . replacing barriers with transparency mehmet günet , attorney for the ditib thinks the building 's glass designs will help break the barrier between the city 's muslims and non-muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne could be the scene of a rowdy demonstration in september " we want to have a transparent mosque , " he said .
" and not just from an architectural standpoint .
we want it to be transparent in that everyone can see what goes on in the mosque . " muslim migrant workers have been praying in makeshift mosques in germany for roughly 40 years .
there are now reportedly 2,000 of such structures in germany , as well as 165 traditional mosques . right-wing leaders and extremists from all over europe are planning on meeting sept .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention transcript of remarks as prepared for delivery to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ; with profound gratitude and great humility , i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states .
let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who travelled the farthest - a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - hillary rodham clinton .
to president clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to ted kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next vice-president of the united states , joe biden , i thank you .
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night .
to the love of my life , our next first lady , michelle obama , and to sasha and malia - i love you so much , and i 'm so proud of all of you .
' turmoil ' four years ago , i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who were n't well-off or well-known , but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
that 's why i stand here tonight .
because for 232 years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women - students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the american promise has been threatened once more .
tonight , more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
more of you have cars you ca n't afford to drive , credit card bills you ca n't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
these challenges are not all of government 's making .
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush .
america , we are better than these last eight years .
we are a better country than this .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery compassion this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes .
tonight , i say to the american people , to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough !
this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive .
because next week , in minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third .
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
on 4 november , we must stand up and say : " eight is enough . "
now let there be no doubt .
the republican nominee , john mccain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
and next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
but the record 's clear : john mccain has voted with george bush 90 % of the time .
senator mccain likes to talk about judgement , but really , what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 % of the time ?
i do n't know about you , but i 'm not ready to take a 10 % chance on change .
the truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent .
he said that our economy has made " great progress " under this president .
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
and when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession " , and that we 've become , and i quote , " a nation of whiners " .
' discredited philosophy ' a nation of whiners ?
tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
these are not whiners .
they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
these are the americans that i know .
now , i do n't believe that senator mccain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of americans .
i just think he does n't know .
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $ 5m a year ?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans ?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement ?
it 's not because john mccain does n't care .
it 's because john mccain does n't get it .
for over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
in washington , they call this the ownership society , but what it really means is - you 're on your own .
out of work ?
tough luck .
no health care ?
the market will fix it .
born into poverty ?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you do n't have boots .
you 're on your own .
well it 's time for them to own their failure .
it 's time for us to change america .
paying the mortgage you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under george bush .
i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work .
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight .
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan , i see my grandfather , who signed up after pearl harbor , marched in patton 's army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill .
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , i think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
' my heroes ' when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , i think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
she 's the one who taught me about hard work .
she 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life .
she poured everything she had into me .
and although she can no longer travel , i know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
i do n't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
these are my heroes .
theirs are the stories that shaped me .
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states .
what is that promise ?
it 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
it 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs , look out for american workers , and play by the rules of the road .
ours is a promise that says government can not solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we can not do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
our government should work for us , not against us .
it should help us , not hurt us .
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every american who 's willing to work .
that 's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper ; i am my sister 's keeper .
that 's the promise we need to keep .
that 's the change we need right now .
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president .
workers ' tax cuts change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it .
unlike john mccain , i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .
i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage , high-tech jobs of tomorrow .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them i will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class .
and for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , i will set a clear goal as president : in 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east .
washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years , and john mccain has been there for 26 of them .
in that time , he 's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
and today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .
now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure , not a long-term solution .
not even close .
as president , i will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
i 'll help our auto companies retool , so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america .
i 'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars .
and i 'll invest $ 150bn over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and ca n't ever be outsourced .
america , now is not the time for small plans .
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
and i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance .
i 'll invest in early childhood education .
i 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
and in exchange , i 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
paid sick days now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single american .
if you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
if you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves .
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses ; and the time to protect social security for future generations .
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why i 've laid out how i 'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help america grow .
but i will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we can not meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy .
and democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling america 's promise will require more than just money .
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength " .
yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
but we must also admit that programmes alone ca n't replace parents ; that government ca n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that 's the essence of america 's promise .
iraq and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep america 's promise abroad .
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next commander-in-chief , that 's a debate i 'm ready to have .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11 , i stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
when john mccain said we could just " muddle through " in afghanistan , i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
john mccain likes to say that he 'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
and today , as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration , even after we learned that iraq has a $ 79bn surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
that 's not the judgement we need .
that wo n't keep america safe .
we need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
you do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq .
you do n't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington .
you ca n't truly stand up for georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice - but it is not the change we need .
we are the party of roosevelt .
we are the party of kennedy .
so do n't tell me that democrats wo n't defend this country .
do n't tell me that democrats wo n't keep us safe .
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans - democrats and republicans - have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
as commander-in-chief , i will never hesitate to defend this nation , but i will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
i will end this war in iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
but i will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression .
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
and i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
patriotism these are the policies i will pursue .
and in the weeks ahead , i look forward to debating them with john mccain .
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes .
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people can not disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
the times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
so let us agree that patriotism has no party .
i love this country , and so do you , and so does john mccain .
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america .
so i 've got news for you , john mccain .
we all put our country first .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country america , our work will not be easy .
the challenges we face require tough choices , and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past .
for part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
and that 's what we have to restore .
we may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland , but do n't tell me we ca n't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals .
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
passions fly on immigration , but i do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers .
this too is part of america 's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
they claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
and that 's to be expected .
because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
if you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
you make a big election about small things .
and you know what - it 's worked before .
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
when washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
if your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
i get it .
i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
i do n't fit the typical pedigree , and i have n't spent my career in the halls of washington .
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring .
what the nay-sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
it 's been about you .
for 18 long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
you understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from washington .
change comes to washington .
change happens because the american people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
america , this is one of those moments .
i believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
because i 've seen it .
because i 've lived it .
i 've seen it in illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
i 've seen it in washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
and i 've seen it in this campaign .
in the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
in the republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a democratic ballot , but did .
i 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
martin luther king this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
we have the most powerful military on earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
' we can not walk alone , ' the preacher cried instead , it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
that promise is our greatest inheritance .
it 's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
and it is that promise that 45 years ago today , brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington , before lincoln 's memorial , and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream .
the men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
they could 've heard words of anger and discord .
they could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour , from every walk of life - is that in america , our destiny is inextricably linked .
that together , our dreams can be one .
" we can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" and as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
we can not turn back . "
america , we can not turn back .
not with so much work to be done .
not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
america , we can not turn back .
we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america .

xiao bing-bing qinghai " we must join with the rest of the world " eliza li henan " the olympics will improve china 's reputation " sophie cheng guangdong " we are not dragons , we are friendly " regina yang guizhou " i never thought we could beat the us on gold medals " yamoo wang hebei " the medals prove themselves .
true power ! "
hanny geng zhejiang " the world got to know the ordinary people of china " read what the panel had to say about the olympic games before it began .
xiao bing-bing , engineer , dachaidan , qinghai province i have seen a great olympics .
during the olympics a lot happened : the flying-man liu xiang had to leave the 110m hurdles due to injury .
this made me sad , as did the fact that we did not win in the men 's basketball .
all the chinese around me have been excited by this great event .
our company staff held a basketball match just before the opening ceremony .
we live on a high altitude here at 4000m .
it is difficult to play sport and yet we played .
on the night of the opening ceremony , everybody watched .
i just heard sounds of wonder .
we got information about the olympics on the internet and after work we stayed in and watched olympics .
we talked olympics all the time .
i do n't think it is important how many gold medals we won .
iraq , which only sent a few athletes , also deserves respect .
in china we all supported the flying-man liu xiang because he proved that even east asian men can run fast .
if i had to pick one memory from this olympics it must be michael phelps .
he must come from another planet and americans must feel lucky that they have such a genius .
the olympics is important for china 's place in the international community .
it is a sports pageant and although china was misinterpreted and slighted before the olympics , now the world is welcoming us .
we must take this opportunity and join up with the rest of the world .
return to top eliza li , 21 , student , anyang , henan province i have watched about 30 % of the games .
people talked about the olympics almost everywhere : at home , in public places like the buses and in shops .
china really did a good job in the olympics .
one of my favourite sports is table tennis .
i like zhang yining .
but i was most surprised by michael phelps and i watched most of his events .
liu xiang made a really good impression on me even though he quit the hurdle race .
i still think he is a hero .
i think the olympics will improve china 's reputation in the world .
return to top sophie cheng , student , 17 , zhuhai , guangdong province during the last two weeks my family watched the games all the time - from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. every day .
if we had to go out , we would listen to the radio .
almost everybody has been talking about the games and the athletes .
olympics songs were so popular that most people could sing them .
i was glad to see the great success of the chinese athletes , which was based on the hard work of our athletes .
it was all worth it .
i have seen so many great games and brilliant athletes from phelps to zhang ning , bolt , samuel wanjiru , yelena , cheng and on and on .
my most enduring memory is from the opening ceremony when smiling faces from all over the world were collected centre-stage .
i believe the games has helped the world know china more .
we are not dragons , we are friendly , kind , helpful and peace-loving .
i believe this will change many people 's views of china .
i am proud !
return to top regina yang , teacher , leishan , guizhou province i watched the most of the events involving chinese players .
the atmosphere was very exciting .
we had a free day on 8 august in order to watch the opening ceremony .
during the past two weeks , we experienced so many surprises and some disappointments .
however , it was a wonderful experience for me .
i watched the games at home or with friends in a bar .
people were so excited to talk about how many medals we had got and how things were going .
our medals success was a big surprise .
i never thought we could beat the us on gold medals .
i liked watching the diving , gymnastics , ping pong , basketball , volleyball and many others .
my favourite athletes are liu xiang , yao ming , guo jing-jing , phelps and so on .
the olympics is just a game but it is a great chance for the outside world to know more about the real china .
but i do n't think that the games will have had a big influence on china 's position in the world .
return to top yamoo wang , tianjin , hebei province i have n't watched much of the olympics .
but the atmosphere over the past two weeks has been really exciting .
security was tight .
everywhere we had to show our id card , for example , if you worked in a state-owned company .
even when taking the train , we had to taste all the liquids we travelled with because of security concerns .
this is because the games has been the most important focus for the country .
every single person talked about it all the time .
i am happy about our success on the medal table .
i think the medals prove themselves .
true power !
my one lasting memory is the opening ceremony - the fireworks which looked like footprints and the procession of teams from many different countries .
the olympic games have proven china 's position in the world .
we could be the leader of other countries !
at least , i hope so .
return to top hanny geng , hangzhou , zhejiang province i watched some of the olympics and the opening and closing ceremonies live on television and the internet .
people here cheered on the chinese gold medals and the stunning performances by athletes such as usain bolt and michael phelps .
we talked a lot of olympics during our breaks .
i am very happy about china 's success on the medal tally .
china is still not a super sports power but we are investing a lot of resources .
bolt 's final dash during the 100m sprint will be the strongest memory .
there were controversies - such as the miming by the young girl during the opening ceremony .
the people responsible should have thought of a back-up plan .
they should have let both girls appear on stage or chosen another girl .
but the chinese are a face-saving people and that is why this happened .
i do n't believe it was maliciously planned .
i just think it is ridiculous to defend miming as being in the national interest .
but the olympics was a great chance for the outside world to know the ordinary people of china .
return to top maggie , teacher , sichuan province most people watched the games every single day .
i heard the cheers of neighbours at home and on the streets people talked about the olympics .
in restaurants , bars and open-air squares i saw people watching the olympics .
as for china 's success on the medal table , on the one hand , i feel proud and happy for those athletes .
on the other hand , i think that we should be sensible and not over zealous .
there are too many good images and memories from this olympics , but if i can only pick one , i will pick the tableaux performance at the opening ceremony when people used their instruments to demonstrate a chinese character , pronounced as ' he ' , which means ' harmony and peace ' , that was just so amazing .
the olympics does show that china is an emerging power in the world .
it is also an opportunity to draw all chinese people 's hearts together , no matter where they are around the globe .
chinese people have expressed their enthusiasm and patriotism in this great event .
as a chinese , i am proud to see china 's improvement .
i also have to say that there are still many things we need to improve .
we can make efforts to further develop our country .

hanny geng zhejiang " the world got to know the ordinary people of china " read what the panel had to say about the olympic games before it began .
xiao bing-bing , engineer , dachaidan , qinghai province i have seen a great olympics .
during the olympics a lot happened : the flying-man liu xiang had to leave the 110m hurdles due to injury .
this made me sad , as did the fact that we did not win in the men 's basketball .
all the chinese around me have been excited by this great event .
our company staff held a basketball match just before the opening ceremony .
we live on a high altitude here at 4000m .
it is difficult to play sport and yet we played .
on the night of the opening ceremony , everybody watched .
i just heard sounds of wonder .
we got information about the olympics on the internet and after work we stayed in and watched olympics .
we talked olympics all the time .
i do n't think it is important how many gold medals we won .
iraq , which only sent a few athletes , also deserves respect .
in china we all supported the flying-man liu xiang because he proved that even east asian men can run fast .
if i had to pick one memory from this olympics it must be michael phelps .
he must come from another planet and americans must feel lucky that they have such a genius .
the olympics is important for china 's place in the international community .
it is a sports pageant and although china was misinterpreted and slighted before the olympics , now the world is welcoming us .
we must take this opportunity and join up with the rest of the world .
return to top eliza li , 21 , student , anyang , henan province i have watched about 30 % of the games .
people talked about the olympics almost everywhere : at home , in public places like the buses and in shops .
china really did a good job in the olympics .
one of my favourite sports is table tennis .
i like zhang yining .
but i was most surprised by michael phelps and i watched most of his events .
liu xiang made a really good impression on me even though he quit the hurdle race .
i still think he is a hero .
i think the olympics will improve china 's reputation in the world .
return to top sophie cheng , student , 17 , zhuhai , guangdong province during the last two weeks my family watched the games all the time - from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. every day .
if we had to go out , we would listen to the radio .
almost everybody has been talking about the games and the athletes .
olympics songs were so popular that most people could sing them .
i was glad to see the great success of the chinese athletes , which was based on the hard work of our athletes .
it was all worth it .
i have seen so many great games and brilliant athletes from phelps to zhang ning , bolt , samuel wanjiru , yelena , cheng and on and on .
my most enduring memory is from the opening ceremony when smiling faces from all over the world were collected centre-stage .
i believe the games has helped the world know china more .
we are not dragons , we are friendly , kind , helpful and peace-loving .
i believe this will change many people 's views of china .
i am proud !

i believe this will change many people 's views of china .
i am proud !
return to top regina yang , teacher , leishan , guizhou province i watched the most of the events involving chinese players .
the atmosphere was very exciting .
we had a free day on 8 august in order to watch the opening ceremony .
during the past two weeks , we experienced so many surprises and some disappointments .
however , it was a wonderful experience for me .
i watched the games at home or with friends in a bar .
people were so excited to talk about how many medals we had got and how things were going .
our medals success was a big surprise .
i never thought we could beat the us on gold medals .
i liked watching the diving , gymnastics , ping pong , basketball , volleyball and many others .
my favourite athletes are liu xiang , yao ming , guo jing-jing , phelps and so on .
the olympics is just a game but it is a great chance for the outside world to know more about the real china .
but i do n't think that the games will have had a big influence on china 's position in the world .
return to top yamoo wang , tianjin , hebei province i have n't watched much of the olympics .
but the atmosphere over the past two weeks has been really exciting .
security was tight .
everywhere we had to show our id card , for example , if you worked in a state-owned company .
even when taking the train , we had to taste all the liquids we travelled with because of security concerns .
this is because the games has been the most important focus for the country .
every single person talked about it all the time .
i am happy about our success on the medal table .
i think the medals prove themselves .
true power !
my one lasting memory is the opening ceremony - the fireworks which looked like footprints and the procession of teams from many different countries .
the olympic games have proven china 's position in the world .
we could be the leader of other countries !
at least , i hope so .
return to top hanny geng , hangzhou , zhejiang province i watched some of the olympics and the opening and closing ceremonies live on television and the internet .
people here cheered on the chinese gold medals and the stunning performances by athletes such as usain bolt and michael phelps .
we talked a lot of olympics during our breaks .
i am very happy about china 's success on the medal tally .
china is still not a super sports power but we are investing a lot of resources .
bolt 's final dash during the 100m sprint will be the strongest memory .
there were controversies - such as the miming by the young girl during the opening ceremony .
the people responsible should have thought of a back-up plan .
they should have let both girls appear on stage or chosen another girl .
but the chinese are a face-saving people and that is why this happened .
i do n't believe it was maliciously planned .
i just think it is ridiculous to defend miming as being in the national interest .
but the olympics was a great chance for the outside world to know the ordinary people of china .
return to top maggie , teacher , sichuan province most people watched the games every single day .
i heard the cheers of neighbours at home and on the streets people talked about the olympics .
in restaurants , bars and open-air squares i saw people watching the olympics .
as for china 's success on the medal table , on the one hand , i feel proud and happy for those athletes .
on the other hand , i think that we should be sensible and not over zealous .
there are too many good images and memories from this olympics , but if i can only pick one , i will pick the tableaux performance at the opening ceremony when people used their instruments to demonstrate a chinese character , pronounced as ' he ' , which means ' harmony and peace ' , that was just so amazing .
the olympics does show that china is an emerging power in the world .
it is also an opportunity to draw all chinese people 's hearts together , no matter where they are around the globe .
chinese people have expressed their enthusiasm and patriotism in this great event .
as a chinese , i am proud to see china 's improvement .
i also have to say that there are still many things we need to improve .
we can make efforts to further develop our country .

true power ! "
hanny geng zhejiang " the world got to know the ordinary people of china " read what the panel had to say about the olympic games before it began .
xiao bing-bing , engineer , dachaidan , qinghai province i have seen a great olympics .
during the olympics a lot happened : the flying-man liu xiang had to leave the 110m hurdles due to injury .
this made me sad , as did the fact that we did not win in the men 's basketball .
all the chinese around me have been excited by this great event .
our company staff held a basketball match just before the opening ceremony .
we live on a high altitude here at 4000m .
it is difficult to play sport and yet we played .
on the night of the opening ceremony , everybody watched .
i just heard sounds of wonder .
we got information about the olympics on the internet and after work we stayed in and watched olympics .
we talked olympics all the time .
i do n't think it is important how many gold medals we won .
iraq , which only sent a few athletes , also deserves respect .
in china we all supported the flying-man liu xiang because he proved that even east asian men can run fast .
if i had to pick one memory from this olympics it must be michael phelps .
he must come from another planet and americans must feel lucky that they have such a genius .
the olympics is important for china 's place in the international community .
it is a sports pageant and although china was misinterpreted and slighted before the olympics , now the world is welcoming us .
we must take this opportunity and join up with the rest of the world .
return to top eliza li , 21 , student , anyang , henan province i have watched about 30 % of the games .
people talked about the olympics almost everywhere : at home , in public places like the buses and in shops .
china really did a good job in the olympics .
one of my favourite sports is table tennis .
i like zhang yining .
but i was most surprised by michael phelps and i watched most of his events .
liu xiang made a really good impression on me even though he quit the hurdle race .
i still think he is a hero .
i think the olympics will improve china 's reputation in the world .

if we had to go out , we would listen to the radio .
almost everybody has been talking about the games and the athletes .
olympics songs were so popular that most people could sing them .
i was glad to see the great success of the chinese athletes , which was based on the hard work of our athletes .
it was all worth it .
i have seen so many great games and brilliant athletes from phelps to zhang ning , bolt , samuel wanjiru , yelena , cheng and on and on .
my most enduring memory is from the opening ceremony when smiling faces from all over the world were collected centre-stage .
i believe the games has helped the world know china more .

i have seen so many great games and brilliant athletes from phelps to zhang ning , bolt , samuel wanjiru , yelena , cheng and on and on .
my most enduring memory is from the opening ceremony when smiling faces from all over the world were collected centre-stage .
i believe the games has helped the world know china more .
we are not dragons , we are friendly , kind , helpful and peace-loving .
i believe this will change many people 's views of china .
i am proud !
return to top regina yang , teacher , leishan , guizhou province i watched the most of the events involving chinese players .
the atmosphere was very exciting .
we had a free day on 8 august in order to watch the opening ceremony .
during the past two weeks , we experienced so many surprises and some disappointments .
however , it was a wonderful experience for me .
i watched the games at home or with friends in a bar .
people were so excited to talk about how many medals we had got and how things were going .
our medals success was a big surprise .
i never thought we could beat the us on gold medals .
i liked watching the diving , gymnastics , ping pong , basketball , volleyball and many others .
my favourite athletes are liu xiang , yao ming , guo jing-jing , phelps and so on .
the olympics is just a game but it is a great chance for the outside world to know more about the real china .
but i do n't think that the games will have had a big influence on china 's position in the world .
return to top yamoo wang , tianjin , hebei province i have n't watched much of the olympics .
but the atmosphere over the past two weeks has been really exciting .
security was tight .
everywhere we had to show our id card , for example , if you worked in a state-owned company .
even when taking the train , we had to taste all the liquids we travelled with because of security concerns .
this is because the games has been the most important focus for the country .
every single person talked about it all the time .
i am happy about our success on the medal table .
i think the medals prove themselves .
true power !
my one lasting memory is the opening ceremony - the fireworks which looked like footprints and the procession of teams from many different countries .
the olympic games have proven china 's position in the world .
we could be the leader of other countries !
at least , i hope so .
return to top hanny geng , hangzhou , zhejiang province i watched some of the olympics and the opening and closing ceremonies live on television and the internet .
people here cheered on the chinese gold medals and the stunning performances by athletes such as usain bolt and michael phelps .
we talked a lot of olympics during our breaks .
i am very happy about china 's success on the medal tally .
china is still not a super sports power but we are investing a lot of resources .
bolt 's final dash during the 100m sprint will be the strongest memory .
there were controversies - such as the miming by the young girl during the opening ceremony .
the people responsible should have thought of a back-up plan .
they should have let both girls appear on stage or chosen another girl .
but the chinese are a face-saving people and that is why this happened .
i do n't believe it was maliciously planned .
i just think it is ridiculous to defend miming as being in the national interest .
but the olympics was a great chance for the outside world to know the ordinary people of china .
return to top maggie , teacher , sichuan province most people watched the games every single day .
i heard the cheers of neighbours at home and on the streets people talked about the olympics .
in restaurants , bars and open-air squares i saw people watching the olympics .
as for china 's success on the medal table , on the one hand , i feel proud and happy for those athletes .
on the other hand , i think that we should be sensible and not over zealous .
there are too many good images and memories from this olympics , but if i can only pick one , i will pick the tableaux performance at the opening ceremony when people used their instruments to demonstrate a chinese character , pronounced as ' he ' , which means ' harmony and peace ' , that was just so amazing .
the olympics does show that china is an emerging power in the world .
it is also an opportunity to draw all chinese people 's hearts together , no matter where they are around the globe .
chinese people have expressed their enthusiasm and patriotism in this great event .
as a chinese , i am proud to see china 's improvement .
i also have to say that there are still many things we need to improve .
we can make efforts to further develop our country .

true power ! "
hanny geng zhejiang " the world got to know the ordinary people of china " read what the panel had to say about the olympic games before it began .
xiao bing-bing , engineer , dachaidan , qinghai province " i have seen a great olympics .
during the olympics a lot happened : the flying-man liu xiang had to leave the 110m hurdles due to injury .
this made me sad , as did the fact that we did not win in the men 's basketball .
all the chinese around me have been excited by this great event .
our company staff held a basketball match just before the opening ceremony .
we live on a high altitude here at 4000m .
it is difficult to play sport and yet we played .
on the night of the opening ceremony , everybody watched .
i just heard sounds of wonder .
we got information about the olympics on the internet and after work we stayed in and watched olympics .
we talked olympics all the time .
i do n't think it is important how many gold medals we won .
iraq , which only sent a few athletes , also deserves respect .
in china we all supported the flying-man liu xiang because he proved that even east asian men can run fast .
if i had to pick one memory from this olympics it must be michael phelps .
he must come from another planet and americans must feel lucky that they have such a genius .
the olympics is important for china 's place in the international community .
it is a sports pageant and although china was misinterpreted and slighted before the olympics , now the world is welcoming us .
we must take this opportunity and join up with the rest of the world . "
return to top eliza li , 21 , student , anyang , henan province " i have watched about 30 % of the games .
people talked about the olympics almost everywhere : at home , in public places like the buses and in shops .
china really did a good job in the olympics .
one of my favourite sports is table tennis .
i like zhang yining .
but i was most surprised by michael phelps and i watched most of his events .
liu xiang made a really good impression on me even though he quit the hurdle race .
i still think he is a hero .
i think the olympics will improve china 's reputation in the world . "
return to top sophie cheng , student , 17 , zhuhai , guangdong province " during the last two weeks my family watched the games all the time - from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. every day .
if we had to go out , we would listen to the radio .
almost everybody has been talking about the games and the athletes .
olympics songs were so popular that most people could sing them .
i was glad to see the great success of the chinese athletes , which was based on the hard work of our athletes .
it was all worth it .

day one : monday 25 august day two : tuesday 26 august day three : wednesday 27 august max deveson : substance from the senator 28 august : 2200 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- it was n't his most rousing speech .
but his supporters already know he can deliver powerful rhetoric .
he was n't trying to win over the crowd - after all , he 'd already got them to fill a stadium .
no , this was a speech for the woman in a frank luntz focus group last week who said she was tired of rhetoric and wanted to hear some substance from the illinois senator .
so he gave us his tax policy and his healthcare policy and his energy policy .
with details .
like a 10-year target for energy independence and the promise to make available to all the health plan that congressmen currently enjoy .
none of it would have surprised those who have studied the policies on his website , but this was mr obama 's chance to explain his positions to a primetime audience and he grabbed it with both hands .
so - a substantive ending to a week of contrasts .
we 've had intrigue , feuds , reconciliation , showmanship and the odd policy thrown into the mix as well .
join us next week from the republican convention in st paul for another helping .
max deveson : obama 's big warm-up 28 august : 1930 local time -lrb- 0130 gmt -rrb- al gore got a big reception here at the invesco stadium - his narrow loss -lrb- depending on how you look at it -rrb- of the 2000 election and his subsequent re-emergence as an environmental cassandra have made him something of a party mascot .
his speech tonight was rather lacklustre , however , especially in light of the appearance from new mexico governor bill richardson that preceded it .
mr richardson 's speech was a non-stop series of jibes at john mccain , including the best zinger of the convention so far : " john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes , but we 'll all be paying for his flip-flops . "
and he was the first speaker i have heard in denver to explicitly accuse mr mccain of " changing his mind on torture " - a reference to his support for a bill which did not explicitly ban the cia from using controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding .
by contrast , mr gore showed little anger , although he did offer one joke .
accusing mr mccain of offering the same policies as president bush , he said : " hey , i believe in recycling , but that 's ridiculous . "
one dud speech will do little to dent mr gore 's popularity with democrats .
besides , the speech that everyone 's waiting for is coming at the end of the night ...
jennifer copestake : democrats get down 28 august : 1800 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- tonight , 75,000 people are going to pour out of invesco field and on to the streets of denver to take part in what many people have told me is the most important part of the convention - and what they really came here for .
it 's party time .
there have been hundreds of parties here in denver this week .
last night i went to the so-called " hottest ticket " of the night , unconventional .
i watched as democrats young and older bust a move .
please turn on javascript .

advertisement delegates let their hair down at a convention party max deveson : what obama needs to do 28 august : 1530 local time -lrb- 2130 gmt -rrb- i 'm sitting amid a forest of cameras and anxious producers on the field of the invesco stadium , as the 75,000 seats round me begin to fill up .
it 's hot and you 're only allowed a sunshade if you 're a camera .
as people begin to take their seats , and a local bluegrass band warms up the crowd -lrb- makes a pleasant change from the u2 and bruce springsteen songs on continuous loop being played the rest of the time -rrb- , i thought it would be a good idea to sketch out what barack obama needs to do this evening .
his own campaign manager , david plouffe , told reporters that mr obama will have succeeded if he explains " where he comes from , who he 's going to fight for , what his change means , and the contrast with john mccain " .
separately , mr obama 's chief strategist david axelrod has said that the speech will be about " the risks of continuing down the road we 're on , which is plainly what senator mccain is offering , and he 's going to talk about an alternative path " .
will this strategy please the democrats who have been grumbling throughout the convention that the party has been unwilling to attack mr mccain hard enough ?
" the obama campaign is n't fighting the primary any more , " writes ezra klein of the american prospect .
" they do n't need to be beautiful so much as they need to be effective . "
joe biden and bill clinton went some way towards taking the fight to mr mccain last night , as did the grassroots hit of the convention , montana governor brian schweitzer on tuesday night .
it will be tough for mr obama to rough up john mccain tonight without sacrificing his core message of change and hope .
but he may need to don boxing gloves rather than kid gloves tonight if he wants to wrest control of the political narrative away from the republicans , who have been successfully managing to define mr obama as an inexperienced dilettante in recent weeks .
connie borde : on to invesco 28 august : 1300 local time -lrb- 1900 gmt -rrb- last day : we 're getting our instructions about how to get into invesco , the sports stadium where barack obama will be delivering his acceptance speech later in the day .
the logistics are mind-boggling , the list of do 's and do n'ts perplexing .
imagine getting 75,000 security-cleared people into a stadium .
luckily the weather forecast is good because we 'll be sitting outdoors - waiting - for many hours .
our chairwoman , christine marques says : " bring a book . "
i look around the room at my delegation and my heart softens a bit .
we 've been in close quarters for the past five days .
it 's over soon .
democrats abroad .
our delegation is unique .
we are fluent in 12 languages and we made a 125,000-mile journey from every corner of the world to cast our half-votes .
we are united and working hard to elect a democrat to the white house this fall by getting out the vote from abroad .
it used to be complicated to register to vote and we 've made it easy .
when i watched the performance of our democratic party last night , i got chills .
and most important , i realised that this is what makes all this work that we all do on a volunteer basis worth the effort .
on to invesco , i 'll report back later .
readers ' questions answered what is the mood of the denver locals ?
are they excited and enthused by barack obama ?
if so , do you think colorado will go blue in november ?
tim mcsweeney , dunedun , new zealand jennifer : most of the denver locals i 've met support barack obama but i 'm not sure the feeling is the same in other parts of the state .
at the hotel where i 'm staying , just outside denver , i 've met some very passionate john mccain supporters and i 've been told support for him is strong in many parts of colorado .
i think the race will be very close here .
why do n't the delegates get a vote on the vice-presidential nominee ?
liza , seattle , us max : officially , they do get a vote .
joe biden 's nomination was put to the vote on the floor of the convention .
but because he was the only nominee he was unanimously approved : all of the delegates shouted " aye " when the question was put .
theoretically , however , they could have shouted " no " .
why have some hillary supporters announced they will not vote for obama ?
kwaku kurankye kwatei , hamburg , germany why are these clinton supporters getting so much coverage ?
colin , leeds , uk max : some hillary supporters were so passionate about their own favoured candidate - and less than enthusiastic about mr obama - that they decided to make a point of sticking with mrs clinton , even after she dropped out of the race .
they are getting a lot of coverage because divisions within political parties are always big news - divided parties tend to lose elections .
they are therefore a valid story for journalists to cover .
sometimes journalists can be accused of seeking out disunity where there is none - but not in this case .
mrs clinton won 18m votes in the democratic primaries , and polls suggest that as many as 27 % of her supporters are unwilling to back mr obama .
the delegates were almost evenly divided , after the primaries , between barack obama and hillary clinton .
what obligation is there -lrb- if any -rrb- to vote for barack obama ?
can they still vote for hillary clinton ?
what influences how a delegate votes ?
ed corbett , bridgend , uk connie : under the rules , pledged delegates -lrb- delegates elected in the primary -rrb- are obligated to vote for the candidate they are pledged to - on the first ballot .
if the candidate releases his / her delegates , those delegates are then free to vote for the other candidate - or not .
max : in fact , hillary clinton did release her delegates before the first ballot .
many of the delegates she had won in the primaries chose to switch their vote to obama .
then , in a theatrical moment , when the roll-call of states reached new york , hilary clinton dramatically moved to end the roll-call vote and called on the delegates to approve barack obama 's nomination by acclamation .
the motion was passed , and mr obama became the party 's official nominee .
our diarists connie borde is a super-delegate representing democrats abroad .
she has lived in france for some 40 years , and lectured for half of this period at the prestigious sciences po institute in paris .
she has authored or co-authored books on american cooking , american politics , and english grammar - and is currently translating simone de beauvoir 's the second sex .
" i always supported barack obama , " she says .
" but i waited to give my super-delegate vote until february 2008 when democrats abroad france -lrb- my constituency -rrb- voted in his favour by 71 % . "
she has a french husband , and six children .
max deveson , 30 , is the bbc news website 's washington reporter .
he joined the bbc in 2001 to work as a political analyst in westminster , later moving to the online world news team .
he has an obsessive interest in the us and its politics and was particularly excited to land an interview with ted kennedy on his first assignment in washington this year .
when not obsessing about us politics , max enjoys attempting to play iron and wine songs on the guitar .
jennifer copestake , 25 , is an online video producer for world news america .
she 's been with the programme since its first broadcast in october 2007 .
after the conventions she 'll be video-blogging from a bbc election bus on a 38-day road trip across the country .
jennifer was born in canada and has reported for the cbc , the hill times , the observer and more 4 news .
she 's been in washington since early summer , but will return one day to london , where she lives with her fiance and two cats .
the bbc news website will also publish a diary of the republican convention , featuring louisiana delegate mike bayham .

max deveson : obama 's big warm-up 28 august : 1930 local time -lrb- 0130 gmt -rrb- al gore got a big reception here at the invesco stadium - his narrow loss -lrb- depending on how you look at it -rrb- of the 2000 election and his subsequent re-emergence as an environmental cassandra have made him something of a party mascot .
his speech tonight was rather lacklustre , however , especially in light of the appearance from new mexico governor bill richardson that preceded it .
mr richardson 's speech was a non-stop series of jibes at john mccain , including the best zinger of the convention so far : " john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes , but we 'll all be paying for his flip-flops . "
and he was the first speaker i have heard in denver to explicitly accuse mr mccain of " changing his mind on torture " - a reference to his support for a bill which did not explicitly ban the cia from using controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding .
by contrast , mr gore showed little anger , although he did offer one joke .
accusing mr mccain of offering the same policies as president bush , he said : " hey , i believe in recycling , but that 's ridiculous . "
one dud speech will do little to dent mr gore 's popularity with democrats .
besides , the speech that everyone 's waiting for is coming at the end of the night ...

it 's party time .
there have been hundreds of parties here in denver this week .
last night i went to the so-called " hottest ticket " of the night , unconventional .
i watched as democrats young and older bust a move .

advertisement delegates let their hair down at a convention party max deveson : what obama needs to do 28 august : 1530 local time -lrb- 2130 gmt -rrb- i 'm sitting amid a forest of cameras and anxious producers on the field of the invesco stadium , as the 75,000 seats round me begin to fill up .
it 's hot and you 're only allowed a sunshade if you 're a camera .
as people begin to take their seats , and a local bluegrass band warms up the crowd -lrb- makes a pleasant change from the u2 and bruce springsteen songs on continuous loop being played the rest of the time -rrb- , i thought it would be a good idea to sketch out what barack obama needs to do this evening .
his own campaign manager , david plouffe , told reporters that mr obama will have succeeded if he explains " where he comes from , who he 's going to fight for , what his change means , and the contrast with john mccain " .
separately , mr obama 's chief strategist david axelrod has said that the speech will be about " the risks of continuing down the road we 're on , which is plainly what senator mccain is offering , and he 's going to talk about an alternative path " .
will this strategy please the democrats who have been grumbling throughout the convention that the party has been unwilling to attack mr mccain hard enough ?
" the obama campaign is n't fighting the primary any more , " writes ezra klein of the american prospect .
" they do n't need to be beautiful so much as they need to be effective . "
joe biden and bill clinton went some way towards taking the fight to mr mccain last night , as did the grassroots hit of the convention , montana governor brian schweitzer on tuesday night .
it will be tough for mr obama to rough up john mccain tonight without sacrificing his core message of change and hope .
but he may need to don boxing gloves rather than kid gloves tonight if he wants to wrest control of the political narrative away from the republicans , who have been successfully managing to define mr obama as an inexperienced dilettante in recent weeks .
connie borde : on to invesco 28 august : 1300 local time -lrb- 1900 gmt -rrb- last day : we 're getting our instructions about how to get into invesco , the sports stadium where barack obama will be delivering his acceptance speech later in the day .
the logistics are mind-boggling , the list of do 's and do n'ts perplexing .
imagine getting 75,000 security-cleared people into a stadium .
luckily the weather forecast is good because we 'll be sitting outdoors - waiting - for many hours .
our chairwoman , christine marques says : " bring a book . "
i look around the room at my delegation and my heart softens a bit .
we 've been in close quarters for the past five days .
it 's over soon .
democrats abroad .
our delegation is unique .
we are fluent in 12 languages and we made a 125,000-mile journey from every corner of the world to cast our half-votes .
we are united and working hard to elect a democrat to the white house this fall by getting out the vote from abroad .
it used to be complicated to register to vote and we 've made it easy .
when i watched the performance of our democratic party last night , i got chills .
and most important , i realised that this is what makes all this work that we all do on a volunteer basis worth the effort .
on to invesco , i 'll report back later .
readers ' questions answered what is the mood of the denver locals ?
are they excited and enthused by barack obama ?
if so , do you think colorado will go blue in november ?
tim mcsweeney , dunedun , new zealand jennifer : most of the denver locals i 've met support barack obama but i 'm not sure the feeling is the same in other parts of the state .
at the hotel where i 'm staying , just outside denver , i 've met some very passionate john mccain supporters and i 've been told support for him is strong in many parts of colorado .
i think the race will be very close here .
why do n't the delegates get a vote on the vice-presidential nominee ?
liza , seattle , us max : officially , they do get a vote .
joe biden 's nomination was put to the vote on the floor of the convention .
but because he was the only nominee he was unanimously approved : all of the delegates shouted " aye " when the question was put .
theoretically , however , they could have shouted " no " .
why have some hillary supporters announced they will not vote for obama ?
kwaku kurankye kwatei , hamburg , germany why are these clinton supporters getting so much coverage ?
colin , leeds , uk max : some hillary supporters were so passionate about their own favoured candidate - and less than enthusiastic about mr obama - that they decided to make a point of sticking with mrs clinton , even after she dropped out of the race .
they are getting a lot of coverage because divisions within political parties are always big news - divided parties tend to lose elections .
they are therefore a valid story for journalists to cover .
sometimes journalists can be accused of seeking out disunity where there is none - but not in this case .
mrs clinton won 18m votes in the democratic primaries , and polls suggest that as many as 27 % of her supporters are unwilling to back mr obama .
the delegates were almost evenly divided , after the primaries , between barack obama and hillary clinton .
what obligation is there -lrb- if any -rrb- to vote for barack obama ?
can they still vote for hillary clinton ?
what influences how a delegate votes ?
ed corbett , bridgend , uk connie : under the rules , pledged delegates -lrb- delegates elected in the primary -rrb- are obligated to vote for the candidate they are pledged to - on the first ballot .
if the candidate releases his / her delegates , those delegates are then free to vote for the other candidate - or not .
max : in fact , hillary clinton did release her delegates before the first ballot .
many of the delegates she had won in the primaries chose to switch their vote to obama .
then , in a theatrical moment , when the roll-call of states reached new york , hilary clinton dramatically moved to end the roll-call vote and called on the delegates to approve barack obama 's nomination by acclamation .
the motion was passed , and mr obama became the party 's official nominee .
our diarists connie borde is a super-delegate representing democrats abroad .
she has lived in france for some 40 years , and lectured for half of this period at the prestigious sciences po institute in paris .
she has authored or co-authored books on american cooking , american politics , and english grammar - and is currently translating simone de beauvoir 's the second sex .
" i always supported barack obama , " she says .
" but i waited to give my super-delegate vote until february 2008 when democrats abroad france -lrb- my constituency -rrb- voted in his favour by 71 % . "
she has a french husband , and six children .

his own campaign manager , david plouffe , told reporters that mr obama will have succeeded if he explains " where he comes from , who he 's going to fight for , what his change means , and the contrast with john mccain " .
separately , mr obama 's chief strategist david axelrod has said that the speech will be about " the risks of continuing down the road we 're on , which is plainly what senator mccain is offering , and he 's going to talk about an alternative path " .
will this strategy please the democrats who have been grumbling throughout the convention that the party has been unwilling to attack mr mccain hard enough ?
" the obama campaign is n't fighting the primary any more , " writes ezra klein of the american prospect .
" they do n't need to be beautiful so much as they need to be effective . "
joe biden and bill clinton went some way towards taking the fight to mr mccain last night , as did the grassroots hit of the convention , montana governor brian schweitzer on tuesday night .
it will be tough for mr obama to rough up john mccain tonight without sacrificing his core message of change and hope .
but he may need to don boxing gloves rather than kid gloves tonight if he wants to wrest control of the political narrative away from the republicans , who have been successfully managing to define mr obama as an inexperienced dilettante in recent weeks .
connie borde : on to invesco 28 august : 1300 local time -lrb- 1900 gmt -rrb- last day : we 're getting our instructions about how to get into invesco , the sports stadium where barack obama will be delivering his acceptance speech later in the day .
the logistics are mind-boggling , the list of do 's and do n'ts perplexing .
imagine getting 75,000 security-cleared people into a stadium .
luckily the weather forecast is good because we 'll be sitting outdoors - waiting - for many hours .
our chairwoman , christine marques says : " bring a book . "
i look around the room at my delegation and my heart softens a bit .
we 've been in close quarters for the past five days .
it 's over soon .
democrats abroad .
our delegation is unique .
we are fluent in 12 languages and we made a 125,000-mile journey from every corner of the world to cast our half-votes .
we are united and working hard to elect a democrat to the white house this fall by getting out the vote from abroad .
it used to be complicated to register to vote and we 've made it easy .
when i watched the performance of our democratic party last night , i got chills .
and most important , i realised that this is what makes all this work that we all do on a volunteer basis worth the effort .
on to invesco , i 'll report back later .
readers ' questions answered what is the mood of the denver locals ?
are they excited and enthused by barack obama ?
if so , do you think colorado will go blue in november ?
tim mcsweeney , dunedun , new zealand jennifer : most of the denver locals i 've met support barack obama but i 'm not sure the feeling is the same in other parts of the state .
at the hotel where i 'm staying , just outside denver , i 've met some very passionate john mccain supporters and i 've been told support for him is strong in many parts of colorado .
i think the race will be very close here .
why do n't the delegates get a vote on the vice-presidential nominee ?
liza , seattle , us max : officially , they do get a vote .
joe biden 's nomination was put to the vote on the floor of the convention .
but because he was the only nominee he was unanimously approved : all of the delegates shouted " aye " when the question was put .
theoretically , however , they could have shouted " no " .
why have some hillary supporters announced they will not vote for obama ?
kwaku kurankye kwatei , hamburg , germany why are these clinton supporters getting so much coverage ?
colin , leeds , uk max : some hillary supporters were so passionate about their own favoured candidate - and less than enthusiastic about mr obama - that they decided to make a point of sticking with mrs clinton , even after she dropped out of the race .
they are getting a lot of coverage because divisions within political parties are always big news - divided parties tend to lose elections .
they are therefore a valid story for journalists to cover .
sometimes journalists can be accused of seeking out disunity where there is none - but not in this case .
mrs clinton won 18m votes in the democratic primaries , and polls suggest that as many as 27 % of her supporters are unwilling to back mr obama .
the delegates were almost evenly divided , after the primaries , between barack obama and hillary clinton .
what obligation is there -lrb- if any -rrb- to vote for barack obama ?
can they still vote for hillary clinton ?
what influences how a delegate votes ?
ed corbett , bridgend , uk connie : under the rules , pledged delegates -lrb- delegates elected in the primary -rrb- are obligated to vote for the candidate they are pledged to - on the first ballot .
if the candidate releases his / her delegates , those delegates are then free to vote for the other candidate - or not .
max : in fact , hillary clinton did release her delegates before the first ballot .
many of the delegates she had won in the primaries chose to switch their vote to obama .
then , in a theatrical moment , when the roll-call of states reached new york , hilary clinton dramatically moved to end the roll-call vote and called on the delegates to approve barack obama 's nomination by acclamation .
the motion was passed , and mr obama became the party 's official nominee .
our diarists connie borde is a super-delegate representing democrats abroad .
she has lived in france for some 40 years , and lectured for half of this period at the prestigious sciences po institute in paris .
she has authored or co-authored books on american cooking , american politics , and english grammar - and is currently translating simone de beauvoir 's the second sex .
" i always supported barack obama , " she says .
" but i waited to give my super-delegate vote until february 2008 when democrats abroad france -lrb- my constituency -rrb- voted in his favour by 71 % . "
she has a french husband , and six children .

day one : monday 25 august day two : tuesday 26 august day three : wednesday 27 august max deveson : substance from the senator 28 august : 2200 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- it was n't his most rousing speech .
but his supporters already know he can deliver powerful rhetoric .
he was n't trying to win over the crowd - after all , he 'd already got them to fill a stadium .
no , this was a speech for the woman in a frank luntz focus group last week who said she was tired of rhetoric and wanted to hear some substance from the illinois senator .
so he gave us his tax policy and his healthcare policy and his energy policy .
with details .
like a 10-year target for energy independence and the promise to make available to all the health plan that congressmen currently enjoy .
none of it would have surprised those who have studied the policies on his website , but this was mr obama 's chance to explain his positions to a primetime audience and he grabbed it with both hands .
so - a substantive ending to a week of contrasts .
we 've had intrigue , feuds , reconciliation , showmanship and the odd policy thrown into the mix as well .
join us next week from the republican convention in st paul for another helping .
max deveson : obama 's big warm-up 28 august : 1930 local time -lrb- 0130 gmt -rrb- al gore got a big reception here at the invesco stadium - his narrow loss -lrb- depending on how you look at it -rrb- of the 2000 election and his subsequent re-emergence as an environmental cassandra have made him something of a party mascot .
his speech tonight was rather lacklustre , however , especially in light of the appearance from new mexico governor bill richardson that preceded it .
mr richardson 's speech was a non-stop series of jibes at john mccain , including the best zinger of the convention so far : " john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes , but we 'll all be paying for his flip-flops . "
and he was the first speaker i have heard in denver to explicitly accuse mr mccain of " changing his mind on torture " - a reference to his support for a bill which did not explicitly ban the cia from using controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding .
by contrast , mr gore showed little anger , although he did offer one joke .
accusing mr mccain of offering the same policies as president bush , he said : " hey , i believe in recycling , but that 's ridiculous . "
one dud speech will do little to dent mr gore 's popularity with democrats .
besides , the speech that everyone 's waiting for is coming at the end of the night ...
jennifer copestake : democrats get down 28 august : 1800 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- tonight , 75,000 people are going to pour out of invesco field and on to the streets of denver to take part in what many people have told me is the most important part of the convention - and what they really came here for .
it 's party time .
there have been hundreds of parties here in denver this week .
last night i went to the so-called " hottest ticket " of the night , unconventional .
i watched as democrats young and older bust a move .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement delegates let their hair down at a convention party max deveson : what obama needs to do 28 august : 1530 local time -lrb- 2130 gmt -rrb- i 'm sitting amid a forest of cameras and anxious producers on the field of the invesco stadium , as the 75,000 seats round me begin to fill up .
it 's hot and you 're only allowed a sunshade if you 're a camera .

readers ' questions answered what is the mood of the denver locals ?
are they excited and enthused by barack obama ?
if so , do you think colorado will go blue in november ?
tim mcsweeney , dunedun , new zealand jennifer : most of the denver locals i 've met support barack obama but i 'm not sure the feeling is the same in other parts of the state .
at the hotel where i 'm staying , just outside denver , i 've met some very passionate john mccain supporters and i 've been told support for him is strong in many parts of colorado .
i think the race will be very close here .
why do n't the delegates get a vote on the vice-presidential nominee ?
liza , seattle , us max : officially , they do get a vote .
joe biden 's nomination was put to the vote on the floor of the convention .
but because he was the only nominee he was unanimously approved : all of the delegates shouted " aye " when the question was put .
theoretically , however , they could have shouted " no " .
why have some hillary supporters announced they will not vote for obama ?
kwaku kurankye kwatei , hamburg , germany why are these clinton supporters getting so much coverage ?
colin , leeds , uk max : some hillary supporters were so passionate about their own favoured candidate - and less than enthusiastic about mr obama - that they decided to make a point of sticking with mrs clinton , even after she dropped out of the race .
they are getting a lot of coverage because divisions within political parties are always big news - divided parties tend to lose elections .
they are therefore a valid story for journalists to cover .
sometimes journalists can be accused of seeking out disunity where there is none - but not in this case .
mrs clinton won 18m votes in the democratic primaries , and polls suggest that as many as 27 % of her supporters are unwilling to back mr obama .
the delegates were almost evenly divided , after the primaries , between barack obama and hillary clinton .
what obligation is there -lrb- if any -rrb- to vote for barack obama ?
can they still vote for hillary clinton ?
what influences how a delegate votes ?
ed corbett , bridgend , uk connie : under the rules , pledged delegates -lrb- delegates elected in the primary -rrb- are obligated to vote for the candidate they are pledged to - on the first ballot .
if the candidate releases his / her delegates , those delegates are then free to vote for the other candidate - or not .
max : in fact , hillary clinton did release her delegates before the first ballot .
many of the delegates she had won in the primaries chose to switch their vote to obama .
then , in a theatrical moment , when the roll-call of states reached new york , hilary clinton dramatically moved to end the roll-call vote and called on the delegates to approve barack obama 's nomination by acclamation .
the motion was passed , and mr obama became the party 's official nominee .
our diarists connie borde is a super-delegate representing democrats abroad .
she has lived in france for some 40 years , and lectured for half of this period at the prestigious sciences po institute in paris .
she has authored or co-authored books on american cooking , american politics , and english grammar - and is currently translating simone de beauvoir 's the second sex .
" i always supported barack obama , " she says .
" but i waited to give my super-delegate vote until february 2008 when democrats abroad france -lrb- my constituency -rrb- voted in his favour by 71 % . "
she has a french husband , and six children .
max deveson , 30 , is the bbc news website 's washington reporter .
he joined the bbc in 2001 to work as a political analyst in westminster , later moving to the online world news team .
he has an obsessive interest in the us and its politics and was particularly excited to land an interview with ted kennedy on his first assignment in washington this year .
when not obsessing about us politics , max enjoys attempting to play iron and wine songs on the guitar .
jennifer copestake , 25 , is an online video producer for world news america .
she 's been with the programme since its first broadcast in october 2007 .
after the conventions she 'll be video-blogging from a bbc election bus on a 38-day road trip across the country .
jennifer was born in canada and has reported for the cbc , the hill times , the observer and more 4 news .
she 's been in washington since early summer , but will return one day to london , where she lives with her fiance and two cats .
the bbc news website will also publish a diary of the republican convention , featuring louisiana delegate mike bayham .

mccain spokesman tucker bounds dismisses mr obama 's speech number news some 75,000 people cram into a sports stadium to hear barack obama 's 44-minute-long acceptance speech .
a new gallup daily tracking poll meanwhile suggests mr obama may be getting the first signs of a boost from the convention .
according to the poll , he leads mr mccain 48 % to 42 % among registered voters , whereas before the convention began gallup had the race locked in a tie , with both candidates on 45 % .
however , a daily rasmussen reports national poll suggests the pair are still neck-and-neck at 47 % .
almost three-quarters of democratic voters believe the convention has helped unify the party , according to another rasmussen survey , with 84 % saying hillary clinton 's speech helped mr obama .
almost seven in 10 democratic voters believe mrs clinton genuinely wants mr obama to become president , the poll suggests , but only 45 % of all voters surveyed believe that to be the case .

he also thanked erstwhile rival hillary clinton .

the choice of the denver broncos stadium as the venue for barack obama 's acceptance speech ensured that the visuals would be impressive .
the huge crowd , the raised circular stage , the columns behind him .
the streamers and fireworks shooting through the air .
all of it was designed for the history books .
but the speech itself , though filled with some powerful moments , did not always soar to the rhetorical heights for which the senator is known .
instead , he chose to use it to lay out some specific policy pledges and to launch a focused attack on his republican opponent , john mccain . "
his kenyan father was barely mentioned .
instead , he spoke about his kansas grandparents " convention a success , for now he portrayed him as a man of the past , a washington insider who has had his time in power - plenty of it - but wasted it .
and , drawing on some of the mccain campaign 's recent statements about the current economic situation , he attacked him for being out of touch with the struggles being faced by ordinary americans .
" it 's not because john mccain does n't care - it 's because john mccain does n't get it , " he said .
picking up one of the themes of the convention , he linked mr mccain to president george w bush , pointing out that , despite his reputation for being a maverick who could appeal to those all-important independent voters , the arizona senator had actually supported the current president on most issues .
and , while he did not make any specific references to john mccain 's age - he could not do - there was a subtle thread going through the speech , a suggestion that his opponent was a man of the past , while he was a man of the future .
stump speech as for his policy pledges , one of the most eye-catching was a promise to cut taxes for 95 % of working families .
the crowd roared at that point .
this was the democratic candidate trying to reclaim the popular , tax-cutting mantle from the republican party .
he also called for ending us dependency on foreign oil within 10 years .
there were personal moments as well - although perhaps not as many as might have been expected from a candidate whose mixed-race background and unusual name still makes him seem exotic to many americans .
after his wife , michelle , spoke to the conference on monday , mr obama used parts of his speech to reinforce the message that his background is , in fact , a typical american one .
his kenyan father was barely mentioned .
instead , he spoke about his kansas grandparents : his grandfather who served in general patton 's army and his grandmother , who had struggled against sexual discrimination at the workplace .
those stories formed the basis for his retort to john mccain 's recent advert , portraying obama as an out-of-touch celebrity " i do n't know what sort of lives john mccain thinks celebrities lead - but this has been mine . "
apart from his relatives , there were several other references to ordinary americans he had met on the campaign trail , in what seemed at times more like a stump speech than a one-off moment for the history books .
but , then , perhaps that was the point .
as his ecstatic supporters in the crowd waved signs saying " change " , it seemed mr obama had decided to answer two lines of criticism : that there is little substance to his slogans and that he has not been effective in attacking john mccain .
he certainly was on thursday night , but perhaps at the expense of giving a speech that will be remembered as one of his finest .
if it helps him win the battle for the white house , though , he probably will not shed too many tears .

the choice of the denver broncos stadium as the venue for barack obama 's acceptance speech ensured that the visuals would be impressive .
the huge crowd , the raised circular stage , the columns behind him .
the streamers and fireworks shooting through the air .
all of it was designed for the history books .
but the speech itself , though filled with some powerful moments , did not always soar to the rhetorical heights for which the senator is known .
instead , he chose to use it to lay out some specific policy pledges and to launch a focused attack on his republican opponent , john mccain .
his kenyan father was barely mentioned .
instead , he spoke about his kansas grandparents convention a success , for now he portrayed him as a man of the past , a washington insider who has had his time in power - plenty of it - but wasted it .
and , drawing on some of the mccain campaign 's recent statements about the current economic situation , he attacked him for being out of touch with the struggles being faced by ordinary americans .
" it 's not because john mccain does n't care - it 's because john mccain does n't get it , " he said .
picking up one of the themes of the convention , he linked mr mccain to president george w bush , pointing out that , despite his reputation for being a maverick who could appeal to those all-important independent voters , the arizona senator had actually supported the current president on most issues .
and , while he did not make any specific references to john mccain 's age - he could not do - there was a subtle thread going through the speech , a suggestion that his opponent was a man of the past , while he was a man of the future .
stump speech as for his policy pledges , one of the most eye-catching was a promise to cut taxes for 95 % of working families .
the crowd roared at that point .
this was the democratic candidate trying to reclaim the popular , tax-cutting mantle from the republican party .
he also called for ending us dependency on foreign oil within 10 years .
there were personal moments as well - although perhaps not as many as might have been expected from a candidate whose mixed-race background and unusual name still makes him seem exotic to many americans .
after his wife , michelle , spoke to the conference on monday , mr obama used parts of his speech to reinforce the message that his background is , in fact , a typical american one .
his kenyan father was barely mentioned .
instead , he spoke about his kansas grandparents : his grandfather who served in general patton 's army and his grandmother , who had struggled against sexual discrimination at the workplace .
those stories formed the basis for his retort to john mccain 's recent advert , portraying obama as an out-of-touch celebrity " i do n't know what sort of lives john mccain thinks celebrities lead - but this has been mine . "
apart from his relatives , there were several other references to ordinary americans he had met on the campaign trail , in what seemed at times more like a stump speech than a one-off moment for the history books .
but , then , perhaps that was the point .
as his ecstatic supporters in the crowd waved signs saying " change " , it seemed mr obama had decided to answer two lines of criticism : that there is little substance to his slogans and that he has not been effective in attacking john mccain .
he certainly was on thursday night , but perhaps at the expense of giving a speech that will be remembered as one of his finest .
if it helps him win the battle for the white house , though , he probably will not shed too many tears .

advertisement barack obama addresses the democratic convention barack obama has accepted the democratic party 's historic nomination to run for president of the us in front of a crowd of some 75,000 people .
in an address at the party 's national convention in denver , he promised he would do his best to keep alive the american dream of opportunity for all .
" america , we are better than these last eight years , " he told cheering crowds .
" we are a better country than this . "
mr obama is the first african-american to be nominated by a major us party .
in his speech at denver 's invesco stadium , mr obama promised to reverse the economic downturn afflicting the us and restore the nation 's standing in the world .
i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom barack obama election at-a-glance : 28 aug speech rich in detail , not rhetoric democratic success - for now " we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight years , " he said .
he also attacked the record of the bush administration and his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain .
" this moment - this election - is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the american promise alive . "
mr obama criticised mr mccain as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary americans and said he had failed to help them on issues such as the economy , health care and education .
he also stressed that he would call for the withdrawal of troops from iraq , whereas mr mccain stood " alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war " , he said .
his supporters and those sympathetic to him are breathing a sigh of relief bbc north america editor justin webb , on the obama nomination read justin 's thoughts in full us media assesses obama speech " i will restore our moral standing , so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , who yearn for a better future , " he said he rejected criticism by the mccain campaign that he is a " celebrity " , pointing to his family 's past financial hardships , and said his rival should stop questioning his patriotism .
in a final rallying call , mr obama recalled the message of martin luther king , who - 45 years ago to the day - gave his " i have a dream " speech in his historic march on washington .
" america , we can not turn back , " he said .
" we can not walk alone .
at this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to walk into the future . "
joined on stage by his family and running-mate , joe biden , mr obama was given a standing ovation by the crowds .
' not ready ' earlier in the day , mr mccain ran a tv advert in which he congratulated mr obama on the historic nature - and date - of his nomination , saying it was " truly a good day for america " .
the political truce was short-lived , however , with a spokesman for the mccain campaign issuing a statement following mr obama 's address that dismissed his words as " misleading " .
if you like the bush-cheney approach , john mccain 's your man .
if you want change , then vote for barack obama and joe biden former vice-president al gore send us your comments diary : big warm-up democratic voters react " tonight , americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama , " spokesman tucker bounds said .
" the fact remains , barack obama is still not ready to be president . "
the bbc 's justin webb in denver says that this needed to be a serious speech by mr obama and it was .
one feature was that mr obama made frequent reference to the future , our correspondent says .
the obama camp knows that americans are worried about mr mccain 's age and ever so subtly they are making an allusion to it .
martin luther king 's eldest son , martin luther king iii , had earlier told the convention that his father 's dream lived on in mr obama 's candidacy .
" he is in the hopes and dreams , the competence and courage , the rightness and readiness of barack obama . "
former vice-president al gore also called on the democrats to " seize this opportunity for change " and elect mr obama .
linking mr mccain firmly to the policies of president george w bush , mr gore said it was vital that americans changed course if they wanted to tackle a " self-inflicted economic crisis " , protect the rights of every american and halt global warming .
mr gore added that the us was " facing a planetary emergency " and that the ties of mr mccain and the republicans to big oil firms meant they would not act to end the country 's reliance on fossil fuels .
' open convention ' mr gore 's address , warmly received by the crowd , followed performances from singers stevie wonder , sheryl crow and john legend .
the obama campaign took the unusual move of holding the closing night speeches in the sports stadium to allow ordinary voters , as well as party delegates , to attend . .
tens of thousands of people gathered to hear mr obama 's speech enlarge image mr obama 's much-anticipated appearance was the highlight of the party 's carefully choreographed four-day event .
questions remain as to whether mr obama can cement his standing within his own party , and reach out to those parts of the electorate that are yet to be convinced by him , the bbc 's matthew price in denver notes .
he was resoundingly endorsed by ex-president bill clinton on wednesday , which may help consolidate his standing .
earlier that same day , in a moment of high drama , his defeated rival hillary clinton cut short a roll-call vote to endorse mr obama 's candidacy by acclamation , in a powerful gesture of unity .
the presidential election on 4 november will pit mr obama against mr mccain , who will be nominated next week at his party 's convention in st paul , minnesota .
republican officials say mr mccain has chosen his running-mate , but the person 's identity has not yet been announced .
mr mccain is due to hold a 10,000-strong rally in the swing state of ohio on friday , at which it was expected he would present his vice-presidential candidate .
