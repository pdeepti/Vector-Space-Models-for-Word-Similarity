energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.11.2008 dr congo rebel leader agrees to un peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 250,000 people have been displaced by the fighting rebel leader laurent nkunda has told the united nations special peace envoy that he wants to hold ceasefire talks with president joseph kabila 's government . " today is a great day for us because we were losing many men and now we have a message of peace , " said nkunda after talks on sunday , nov .
16 , with olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , in rebel-held territory in the eastern democratic republic of congo .
" we should work with this mission . "
" we agreed to open humanitarian corridors to support the process , " added nkunda .
obasanjo , however , commented that maintaining a ceasefire is like dancing a tango : " one does not dance the tango alone . "
the meeting was the first time in weeks that nkunda had received a foreign envoy .
obasanjo was appointed by un secretary general ban ki-moon last week to serve as peace envoy to dr congo as the humanitarian situation there worsens .
nkunda accuses president joseph kabila of using a rwandan hutu rebel group , which includes perpetrators of the 1994 genocide , to fight with the congolese army .
he has threatened to topple kabila 's government if he is not granted negotiations with the president .
kabila , on the other hand , has accused rwanda of supporting nkunda 's rebellion and has so far rejected the rebel leader 's call for direct negotiations .

" we are determined to enhance our cooperation and work together to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world 's financial systems , " said the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leaders , which included the world 's advanced economies as well as the leading emerging economies .
the g20 represents 85 percent of the global economy . merkel says summit a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted to ensure markets are regulated and monitored german chancellor angela merkel dubbed the conference a " great success , " saying that " its main message is that nowhere in the world should there be markets , market participants or even products that do not have to submit to regulations and rules of transparency . " however , the group 's final paper did not specify measures to regulate hedge funds , something merkel has long championed , but which has not resonated with the us government . the group did commit to using " fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect , " while delegating regulation to " national regulators " instead of organizing a coordinated stimulus package , which british prime minister gordon brown had been a strong advocate of . treading diplomatically , french president nicolas sarkozy was careful in washington not to repeat his recent appeal for a " new capitalism . " us president george w. bush , who hosted the summit just weeks before the end of his presidency , said the event 's aim was to adapt " the financial structures to the realities of the 21st century . " held in washington 's ornate national building museum , the summit was the first time that g20 government chiefs have met together since the organization was established in 1999 . the meeting was held against the backdrop of signs of a further rapid decline in the global economy .
earlier this week , official statistics showed that the 15-member euro zone has slid into a recession , as have a number of its strongest economies . different approaches to regulation addressing the participants , bush underlined the differences that had emerged , especially between europe and the us in the run-up to the summit on the degree of financial market regulation and control . " i 'm a free market person , " bush said , adding that even though nations ' economies were " being hit very hard , there is a common understanding that all of us should protect pro-growth economic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's economic team face a tough start to the job russian president dmitry medvedev said working together with the us to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations , and added that a new us administration under president-elect barack obama offered a fresh chance to improve ties . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank after attending the g20 summit . apart from strengthening global financial transparency , accountability and disclosure measures , the meeting ended with the leaders also calling for immediate steps . plan for immediate action these include the creation of a new monitoring mechanism through a system of " supervisory colleges . "
under the plan , national regulators would come together to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions . finance ministers have been given a deadline of march 31 to hammer out the details of the proposals , prior to a second g20 meeting in april .
obama , who is inaugurated on jan .
20 , will be in office at that time . six areas in particular are to be focused on : regulating problematic parts of the financial markets , increasing transparency and reforming " fat cat " compensation practices for executives .
they will also examine global accounting norms and the financing needs of international financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf faces reform finally , the ministers are to look at " comprehensively " reforming top international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank to " reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges . " " emerging and developing economies , " the leaders said , " should have greater voice and representation in these institutions . " the g20 leaders also said they want to " strive to reach agreement this year on modalities " that would lead a successful conclusion to the troubled world trade organization doha round .

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.11.2008 opinion : landmark finance summit sets new world order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the emergency summit in washington , g20 leaders agreed to tighten regulations and increase transparency of the financial markets .
but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .

the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?

all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .

the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" held in washington 's ornate national building museum , the summit was the first time that g20 government chiefs have met together since the organization was established in 1999 . the meeting was held against the backdrop of signs of a further rapid decline in the global economy .
earlier this week , official statistics showed that the 15-member euro zone has slid into a recession , as have a number of its strongest economies . different approaches to regulation addressing the participants , bush underlined the differences that had emerged , especially between europe and the us in the run-up to the summit on the degree of financial market regulation and control . " i 'm a free market person , " bush said , adding that even though nations ' economies were " being hit very hard , there is a common understanding that all of us should protect pro-growth economic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's economic team face a tough start to the job russian president dmitry medvedev said working together with the us to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations , and added that a new us administration under president-elect barack obama offered a fresh chance to improve ties . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank after attending the g20 summit . apart from strengthening global financial transparency , accountability and disclosure measures , the meeting ended with the leaders also calling for immediate steps . plan for immediate action these include the creation of a new monitoring mechanism through a system of " supervisory colleges . "
under the plan , national regulators would come together to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions . finance ministers have been given a deadline of march 31 to hammer out the details of the proposals , prior to a second g20 meeting in april .
obama , who is inaugurated on jan .
20 , will be in office at that time . six areas in particular are to be focused on : regulating problematic parts of the financial markets , increasing transparency and reforming " fat cat " compensation practices for executives .
they will also examine global accounting norms and the financing needs of international financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf faces reform finally , the ministers are to look at " comprehensively " reforming top international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank to " reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges .

" today is a great day for us because we were losing many men and now we have a message of peace , " said nkunda after talks on sunday , nov .

" we should work with this mission . "
" we agreed to open humanitarian corridors to support the process , " added nkunda .
obasanjo , however , commented that maintaining a ceasefire is like dancing a tango : " one does not dance the tango alone . "
the meeting was the first time in weeks that nkunda had received a foreign envoy .
obasanjo was appointed by un secretary general ban ki-moon last week to serve as peace envoy to dr congo as the humanitarian situation there worsens .
nkunda accuses president joseph kabila of using a rwandan hutu rebel group , which includes perpetrators of the 1994 genocide , to fight with the congolese army .
he has threatened to topple kabila 's government if he is not granted negotiations with the president .
kabila , on the other hand , has accused rwanda of supporting nkunda 's rebellion and has so far rejected the rebel leader 's call for direct negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

" today is a great day for us because we were losing many men and now we have a message of peace , " said nkunda after talks on sunday , nov .
16 , with olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , in rebel-held territory in the eastern democratic republic of congo .
" we should work with this mission . "
" we agreed to open humanitarian corridors to support the process , " added nkunda .
obasanjo , however , commented that maintaining a ceasefire is like dancing a tango : " one does not dance the tango alone . "
the meeting was the first time in weeks that nkunda had received a foreign envoy .
obasanjo was appointed by un secretary general ban ki-moon last week to serve as peace envoy to dr congo as the humanitarian situation there worsens .
nkunda accuses president joseph kabila of using a rwandan hutu rebel group , which includes perpetrators of the 1994 genocide , to fight with the congolese army .
he has threatened to topple kabila 's government if he is not granted negotiations with the president .
kabila , on the other hand , has accused rwanda of supporting nkunda 's rebellion and has so far rejected the rebel leader 's call for direct negotiations .
aid access worsens as violence continues fighting continued throughout the day sunday between government troops and rebel forces , the un mission in dr congo -lrb- monuc -rrb- said .
aid workers have said the violence is keeping them from bringing assistance to displaced people .
" we 've got enough aid , but now the problem is access , " said christophe illemassene , spokesman for the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian aid in kinshasa -lrb- ocha -rrb- , reported afp news agency . the un has estimated that around 250,000 people have been displaced due to weeks of fighting . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .

g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.11.2008 opinion : landmark finance summit sets new world order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the emergency summit in washington , g20 leaders agreed to tighten regulations and increase transparency of the financial markets .
but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

now narcotics experts are warning that the country has turned into a " narco-state " as drug smugglers take advantage of weak governance and policing to effectively run the country .
the international community - including the european union , the un and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- - is funding the polls .
the donors are hoping that a stable government will emerge from the election , during which almost 600,000 voters will elect 100 members of parliament .

life expectancy at birth is only 46 years .
the country 's main export is cashew nuts , and until recently it had little or no foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- .
however , the un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- said in a recent report that it saw a spike in fdi to 42 million dollars in 2006 , pointing to a jump in profits from the cocaine industry .
the smugglers transport drugs across the atlantic by boat or light aircraft and then offload them in guinea-bissau .
the drugs are then smuggled into europe .
the drug-trafficking issue was one of the major campaigning points in the election , with parties accusing each other of being on the payroll of south american drug barons .
election observers in place over 150 foreign election observers , including a strong eu mission , are on the ground to monitor the polls , which four parties are expected to dominate .
president joao bernardo " nino " vieira hopes that the newly formed republican party for independence and development -lrb- prid -rrb- , led by one of his allies , will perform strongly .
vieira returned to power in 2005 , six years after he was ousted in the civil war .
vieira is a hero of the independence struggle against portugal and ruled the country for 19 years prior to the civil war .
but vieira has faced problems since he regained power and just after parliament dissolved in august he had his navy chief arrested on suspicion of planning a coup .
aligned against the prid is the traditionally strong paigc and the social renewal party -lrb- prs -rrb- , which has the support of the balante ethnic group .
the development , democracy and citizenship party -lrb- padec -rrb- is also viewed as having a shot a joining a ruling coalition . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .

let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?

all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .

" the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .

he has threatened to topple kabila 's government if he is not granted negotiations with the president .
kabila , on the other hand , has accused rwanda of supporting nkunda 's rebellion and has so far rejected the rebel leader 's call for direct negotiations .

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .

and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .

and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are determined to enhance our cooperation and work together to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world 's financial systems , " said the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leaders , which included the world 's advanced economies as well as the leading emerging economies .
the g20 represents 85 percent of the global economy . merkel says summit a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted to ensure markets are regulated and monitored german chancellor angela merkel dubbed the conference a " great success , " saying that " its main message is that nowhere in the world should there be markets , market participants or even products that do not have to submit to regulations and rules of transparency . " however , the group 's final paper did not specify measures to regulate hedge funds , something merkel has long championed , but which has not resonated with the us government . the group did commit to using " fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect , " while delegating regulation to " national regulators " instead of organizing a coordinated stimulus package , which british prime minister gordon brown had been a strong advocate of . treading diplomatically , french president nicolas sarkozy was careful in washington not to repeat his recent appeal for a " new capitalism . " us president george w. bush , who hosted the summit just weeks before the end of his presidency , said the event 's aim was to adapt " the financial structures to the realities of the 21st century .

energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .

" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

but that 's not the only reason the meeting was a success , says dw 's michael knigge . expectations ahead of the economic summit differed greatly .
some were hoping for the big bang , the rebirth of the global financial order .
others were hoping to get back to their daily business quickly after a nice sounding but meaningless appeal from the g20 states .
but the g20 summit in washington was a disappointment to both extreme positions - and that 's exactly why it was a success .
us president george w. bush was right when he said before the meeting that the crisis did n't start over night and could n't be resolved in just one day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge but the europeans , and particularly the germans , were also right to insist on revamping the global financial system as quickly and as concretely as possible .
concrete plan with a deadline the result of the comprehensive final report is clear : the joint paper not only pledges the establishment of new global regulatory bodies , better monitoring of the rating agencies and the regulation of high-risk hedge funds .
it also calls for more transparency and predictability in the global financial and economic order .
the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

now narcotics experts are warning that the country has turned into a " narco-state " as drug smugglers take advantage of weak governance and policing to effectively run the country .
the international community - including the european union , the un and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- - is funding the polls .
the donors are hoping that a stable government will emerge from the election , during which almost 600,000 voters will elect 100 members of parliament .

the smugglers transport drugs across the atlantic by boat or light aircraft and then offload them in guinea-bissau .
the drugs are then smuggled into europe .
the drug-trafficking issue was one of the major campaigning points in the election , with parties accusing each other of being on the payroll of south american drug barons .
election observers in place over 150 foreign election observers , including a strong eu mission , are on the ground to monitor the polls , which four parties are expected to dominate .
president joao bernardo " nino " vieira hopes that the newly formed republican party for independence and development -lrb- prid -rrb- , led by one of his allies , will perform strongly .
vieira returned to power in 2005 , six years after he was ousted in the civil war .
vieira is a hero of the independence struggle against portugal and ruled the country for 19 years prior to the civil war .
but vieira has faced problems since he regained power and just after parliament dissolved in august he had his navy chief arrested on suspicion of planning a coup .
aligned against the prid is the traditionally strong paigc and the social renewal party -lrb- prs -rrb- , which has the support of the balante ethnic group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2008 energy-saving bulbs to light up the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-saving bulbs are n't that bright , said one consumer test almost 20 percent of all the energy produced in the world is used to power lights .
energy-saving bulbs could help - though so far the ones on the market are n't quite up to par . the potential is enormous .
if all the traditional light bulbs in the world were replaced with energy-saving ones , lighting energy use could be cut by 40 percent .
by 2030 , 16 billion tons of co2 would have been prevented from escaping into the atmosphere .
that 's according to a new study released by the renowned worldwatch institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional bulbs only turn five percent of the electricity they use into light the use of energy saving bulbs is on the rise worldwide .
since the beginning of the century , use has tripled to over four billion , and some countries are calling for more .
australia has even gone so far as to say that after october 2009 the sale of traditional light bulbs will be outlawed .
manufacturers say energy-saving bulbs have an efficiency factor of 25 percent - five times that of a traditional light bulb .
energy saving bulbs also last longer , and experts predict that those who use them save up to 100 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- per lamp over a 10-year period .
not perfect yet but not everyone is singing the praises of the little bulbs that could .
the german ecological product review " oekotest " put 16 models through a rigorous set of tests and came to a sobering conclusion : most energy saving light bulbs are n't as bright as they should be .
according to the magazine , the light quality was poor , sometimes flickered and did n't last as long as manufacturers claimed .
the lamps were also found to contain poisonous mercury .
in the end , " oekotest " said energy-saving lamps were hardly recommendable . meanwhile , however , industry researchers are working on developing alternatives .
some of them are focusing on light-emitting diodes , or leds .
they are twice as efficient as energy saving bulbs , said shuji nakamura , a physicist at the university of santa barbara in california .
an led is a small electronic chip .
when electricity is sent through it , the electrons get excited and give off energy in the form of light .
leds have been around for a long time and they 're often found in the little red or green lights on stereo systems .
in the 1990s nakamura laid the ground work for a white led - and with it , the basis for a new type of lamp .
integrated light sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds are energy efficient , but not bright enough to use on a large scale white leds have already been around for several years in the form of flashlights and bike lights , but according to bremen physicist detlef hommel they are n't yet bright enough to be used for regular lighting or automobile headlights .
" in order to really be able to make car head lights with leds we 'll have to push the envelope .
and to do that there are a lot of physical challenges to that , " he said .
another downside is that currently led lamps are quite expensive , and until they 're somehow made more affordable , will never be successful on the mass market .
but just as leds are an alternative to energy saving bulbs , so too is there an alternative to the led : the oled , which are lights made from luminous plastic molecules .
uli lemmer , a physicist at the university of karlsruhe , said it would very easy to make lamps out of them .
he said he envisioned them being integrated as large-scale , random light sources into the architecture of buildings .
" in other words an entire wall or ceiling completely lit up , " he says .
hard to beat a classic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas edison invented the light bulb over a century ago but uli lemmer said that vision is still a long way off . " they 're competing with edison 's light bulb , which has been optimized over the course of more than a century and can be mass produced in a very cost efficient way , " he adds .
and that means that it 'll be at least another decade before lamps made from luminous plastic will be available on the market . frank grotelueschen -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are determined to enhance our cooperation and work together to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world 's financial systems , " said the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leaders , which included the world 's advanced economies as well as the leading emerging economies .
the g20 represents 85 percent of the global economy . merkel says summit a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted to ensure markets are regulated and monitored german chancellor angela merkel dubbed the conference a " great success , " saying that " its main message is that nowhere in the world should there be markets , market participants or even products that do not have to submit to regulations and rules of transparency . " however , the group 's final paper did not specify measures to regulate hedge funds , something merkel has long championed , but which has not resonated with the us government . the group did commit to using " fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect , " while delegating regulation to " national regulators " instead of organizing a coordinated stimulus package , which british prime minister gordon brown had been a strong advocate of . treading diplomatically , french president nicolas sarkozy was careful in washington not to repeat his recent appeal for a " new capitalism . " us president george w. bush , who hosted the summit just weeks before the end of his presidency , said the event 's aim was to adapt " the financial structures to the realities of the 21st century . " held in washington 's ornate national building museum , the summit was the first time that g20 government chiefs have met together since the organization was established in 1999 . the meeting was held against the backdrop of signs of a further rapid decline in the global economy .
earlier this week , official statistics showed that the 15-member euro zone has slid into a recession , as have a number of its strongest economies . different approaches to regulation addressing the participants , bush underlined the differences that had emerged , especially between europe and the us in the run-up to the summit on the degree of financial market regulation and control . " i 'm a free market person , " bush said , adding that even though nations ' economies were " being hit very hard , there is a common understanding that all of us should protect pro-growth economic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's economic team face a tough start to the job russian president dmitry medvedev said working together with the us to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations , and added that a new us administration under president-elect barack obama offered a fresh chance to improve ties . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank after attending the g20 summit . apart from strengthening global financial transparency , accountability and disclosure measures , the meeting ended with the leaders also calling for immediate steps . plan for immediate action these include the creation of a new monitoring mechanism through a system of " supervisory colleges . "
under the plan , national regulators would come together to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions . finance ministers have been given a deadline of march 31 to hammer out the details of the proposals , prior to a second g20 meeting in april .
obama , who is inaugurated on jan .
20 , will be in office at that time . six areas in particular are to be focused on : regulating problematic parts of the financial markets , increasing transparency and reforming " fat cat " compensation practices for executives .
they will also examine global accounting norms and the financing needs of international financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf faces reform finally , the ministers are to look at " comprehensively " reforming top international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank to " reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges .

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .

the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .

now narcotics experts are warning that the country has turned into a " narco-state " as drug smugglers take advantage of weak governance and policing to effectively run the country .
the international community - including the european union , the un and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- - is funding the polls .
the donors are hoping that a stable government will emerge from the election , during which almost 600,000 voters will elect 100 members of parliament .

the smugglers transport drugs across the atlantic by boat or light aircraft and then offload them in guinea-bissau .
the drugs are then smuggled into europe .
the drug-trafficking issue was one of the major campaigning points in the election , with parties accusing each other of being on the payroll of south american drug barons .
election observers in place over 150 foreign election observers , including a strong eu mission , are on the ground to monitor the polls , which four parties are expected to dominate .
president joao bernardo " nino " vieira hopes that the newly formed republican party for independence and development -lrb- prid -rrb- , led by one of his allies , will perform strongly .
vieira returned to power in 2005 , six years after he was ousted in the civil war .
vieira is a hero of the independence struggle against portugal and ruled the country for 19 years prior to the civil war .
but vieira has faced problems since he regained power and just after parliament dissolved in august he had his navy chief arrested on suspicion of planning a coup .
aligned against the prid is the traditionally strong paigc and the social renewal party -lrb- prs -rrb- , which has the support of the balante ethnic group .
the development , democracy and citizenship party -lrb- padec -rrb- is also viewed as having a shot a joining a ruling coalition . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now narcotics experts are warning that the country has turned into a " narco-state " as drug smugglers take advantage of weak governance and policing to effectively run the country .
the international community - including the european union , the un and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- - is funding the polls .
the donors are hoping that a stable government will emerge from the election , during which almost 600,000 voters will elect 100 members of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea bissau 's parliament building was a present from china however , the previous coalition government fell apart in august when the african party for the independence of guinea and cape verde -lrb- paigc -rrb- , which had 45 seats in parliament , abandoned a national stability pact .
one of world 's poorest countries guinea-bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world , and is ranked at 175 out of 177 nations in the un development program 's human development index .
most of its 1.6 million inhabitants survive from subsistence farming .
life expectancy at birth is only 46 years .
the country 's main export is cashew nuts , and until recently it had little or no foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- .
however , the un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- said in a recent report that it saw a spike in fdi to 42 million dollars in 2006 , pointing to a jump in profits from the cocaine industry .
the smugglers transport drugs across the atlantic by boat or light aircraft and then offload them in guinea-bissau .
the drugs are then smuggled into europe .
the drug-trafficking issue was one of the major campaigning points in the election , with parties accusing each other of being on the payroll of south american drug barons .
election observers in place over 150 foreign election observers , including a strong eu mission , are on the ground to monitor the polls , which four parties are expected to dominate .
president joao bernardo " nino " vieira hopes that the newly formed republican party for independence and development -lrb- prid -rrb- , led by one of his allies , will perform strongly .
vieira returned to power in 2005 , six years after he was ousted in the civil war .
vieira is a hero of the independence struggle against portugal and ruled the country for 19 years prior to the civil war .
but vieira has faced problems since he regained power and just after parliament dissolved in august he had his navy chief arrested on suspicion of planning a coup .
aligned against the prid is the traditionally strong paigc and the social renewal party -lrb- prs -rrb- , which has the support of the balante ethnic group .
the development , democracy and citizenship party -lrb- padec -rrb- is also viewed as having a shot a joining a ruling coalition . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international financial organizations are to be reformed .
let 's be honest : just a few months ago , who 'd have thought that the us , of all countries , would host a conference with this result ?
probably no one . the fact that not only a joint action plan was laid out but also a clear timeframe for implementation and an appointment for a follow-up summit gives the process teeth .
blueprint for global crisis management in addition to the concrete results it brought , there 's another reason why the summit was a big success : for the first time , heads-of-state from the world 's most important industrialized countries sat at the same table with their counterparts from emerging nations in order to resolve a global crisis .
and this g20 meeting wo n't just be a one-day thing , but will serve as a blueprint for future global crisis management .
all countries - even the western industrialized nations - unanimously support a larger role for emerging countries like india , china and brazil in international financial bodies .
that is precisely what bush meant when he said that the financial structures have to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century .
with this g20 summit , a new order of global power relations has officially been ushered in .
a return to the order that existed before the finance crisis now seems unthinkable .

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 european leaders temper finance reform rhetoric großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up meeting has been called for april european leaders said the emergency finance summit in washington was a success , even though the resulting action plan was less drastic than some of their original suggestions . the measures agreed to at the meeting include a call for beefing up regulation of the world 's financial system , bolstering government spending to spur economic growth and reforming international financial institutions . " we are determined to enhance our cooperation and work together to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world 's financial systems , " said the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leaders , which included the world 's advanced economies as well as the leading emerging economies .
the g20 represents 85 percent of the global economy . merkel says summit a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted to ensure markets are regulated and monitored german chancellor angela merkel dubbed the conference a " great success , " saying that " its main message is that nowhere in the world should there be markets , market participants or even products that do not have to submit to regulations and rules of transparency . " however , the group 's final paper did not specify measures to regulate hedge funds , something merkel has long championed , but which has not resonated with the us government . the group did commit to using " fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect , " while delegating regulation to " national regulators " instead of organizing a coordinated stimulus package , which british prime minister gordon brown had been a strong advocate of . treading diplomatically , french president nicolas sarkozy was careful in washington not to repeat his recent appeal for a " new capitalism . " us president george w. bush , who hosted the summit just weeks before the end of his presidency , said the event 's aim was to adapt " the financial structures to the realities of the 21st century . " held in washington 's ornate national building museum , the summit was the first time that g20 government chiefs have met together since the organization was established in 1999 . the meeting was held against the backdrop of signs of a further rapid decline in the global economy .
earlier this week , official statistics showed that the 15-member euro zone has slid into a recession , as have a number of its strongest economies . different approaches to regulation addressing the participants , bush underlined the differences that had emerged , especially between europe and the us in the run-up to the summit on the degree of financial market regulation and control . " i 'm a free market person , " bush said , adding that even though nations ' economies were " being hit very hard , there is a common understanding that all of us should protect pro-growth economic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's economic team face a tough start to the job russian president dmitry medvedev said working together with the us to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations , and added that a new us administration under president-elect barack obama offered a fresh chance to improve ties . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank after attending the g20 summit . apart from strengthening global financial transparency , accountability and disclosure measures , the meeting ended with the leaders also calling for immediate steps . plan for immediate action these include the creation of a new monitoring mechanism through a system of " supervisory colleges . "
under the plan , national regulators would come together to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions . finance ministers have been given a deadline of march 31 to hammer out the details of the proposals , prior to a second g20 meeting in april .
obama , who is inaugurated on jan .
20 , will be in office at that time . six areas in particular are to be focused on : regulating problematic parts of the financial markets , increasing transparency and reforming " fat cat " compensation practices for executives .
they will also examine global accounting norms and the financing needs of international financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf faces reform finally , the ministers are to look at " comprehensively " reforming top international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank to " reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges . " " emerging and developing economies , " the leaders said , " should have greater voice and representation in these institutions . " the g20 leaders also said they want to " strive to reach agreement this year on modalities " that would lead a successful conclusion to the troubled world trade organization doha round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.11.2008 emerging economies gain unprecedented clout on global stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emerging countries did n't start the finance crisis , but are strongly affected by it the world 's emerging economic powers came out of the historic financial summit in washington emboldened by their new role in fixing the global economy . the washington summit marked the first-ever meeting of leaders from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations , a bloc that brings together the world 's leading industrial nations and some of the top developing economies including china , india and brazil .
the gathering 's final declaration made clear that the wider bloc will be central to reforming the global financial system over the coming years and made no mention of a role for the smaller g7 or g8 - a sign that emerging economies will keep their seat at the policy table for the foreseeable future .
many leaders spoke of the arrival of new world order , all the more momentous because it happened at a gathering in the united states .
outgoing us president george w. bush , criticized for failing to reach out to the international community for much of his administration , played host to the emergency summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lula called the summit a " historic day " " this is a historic day .
i leave with the certainty that the political geography of the world has been given a new dimension , " brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said after the meeting .
g20 agrees on action plan world leaders on saturday agreed on the principles for major reforms of how financial institutions are regulated .
the g20 's finance ministers are instructed to hammer out the specifics in the coming months , followed by another summit in april .
many developing countries have some reason to gloat .
the financial crisis that has threatened the global economy was not of their making .
instead , it was the result of financial firms in wealthy nations taking unnecessary risks in the us mortgage market .
the international monetary fund has forecast a recession in most advanced economies in 2009 .
the 15 countries in the euro zone this week officially slipped into recession , and the united states is likely to follow suit .
that means powerhouse emerging economies in asia , the middle east and latin america are likely to be the key pillars of economic growth next year .
china 's economy , though slowing , is still forecast to grow at an 8.5-percent clip next year .
india will grow between 7 and 7.5 percent .
" today 's summit was significant because of the people present .
a new world economic order is developing that is more dynamic and more inclusive than any we have yet seen , " said dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund .
but while the g20 represents a broader array of interests than in past crises , aid groups lamented that it still failed to capture the views of the world 's poorest nations .
critics : poor not included the economic summit produced an action plan , but the agreement only includes 20 countries .
many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries were not included in this summit , yet they may suffer the most from the economic downturn , " said gawain kripke of oxfam international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-tier world is not acceptable , said zoellick from the world bank the world bank has warned that hundreds of millions could be plunged back into poverty as developing nations , especially in africa , face a triple threat to their economies from the credit crisis as well as higher food and energy costs .
" the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold , " said world bank president robert zoellick .
" we will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions by accepting a two-tier world . "
the g20 leaders pledged to keep their aid commitments to world 's poor and resolved not to open up new barriers to trade in response to the economic downturn .
but one of the keys for the developing world - representation in global financial institutions - will take much longer to solve .
the g20 resolved to give emerging countries a greater voice in the imf , world bank and financial stability forum , which are largely controlled by the us and europe .
the pace of those reforms will answer whether this new world order is here to stay . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , after the gathering of 20 world economic powers in washington to address the financial crisis , medvedev said there is " no trust in russian-us relations - the trust we need " to tackle international challenges and strengthen ties . however , he also signaled a readiness to enter into talks with the us over its plan to build a missile shield in eastern europe . " we will not do anything until america does the first step , " medvedev said .
" i think we have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global -lrb- anti-missile -rrb- system or to find a solution on the existing programs which would suit the russian federation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , medvedev threatened to station missiles in kaliningrad for the first time , medvedev indicated that moscow could settle for something less than the complete cancelation of the missile shield plans . on nov .
5 , one day after the presidential election in the us , the russian president had announced that moscow would place missiles in its eastern european enclave of kaliningrad if washington went ahead with the missile defense plan . optimistic about obama medvedev seemed optimistic that the transition in the white house would provide a fresh opportunity for a new friendship between the two countries .
president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has been critical of us president george w. bush 's plans to build a missile defense system in eastern europe , but has n't yet taken a clear stance on the issue . " the first signal we received -lrb- from president-elect obama -rrb- shows that our partners think about this program rather than plan to simply rubber-stamp it , " medvedev said . the bush administration insists the system , to be built in poland and the czech republic , is required to counter iran 's growing ballistic missile capability .
however , the kremlin considers the deployment a threat that would weaken its strategic nuclear deterrent . france told to mind its own business french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency , told reporters on the sidelines of the washington finance summit that " each country has the right to decide whether or not to install an anti-missile shield . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and poland signed a deal in august sarkozy cited poland and the czech republic , whose leaders responded frostily to the comments . " the question of the anti-missile shield is governed by an agreement between poland and the united states , " said polish prime minister donald tusk .
" i do n't think that third countries , even such good friends as france , have a particular right to express themselves on this issue . " in august , the us signed an agreement with poland to help modernize its military in exchange for the right to position the interceptor missiles on its territory . at an eu-russia summit on friday in nice , france , sarkozy had called on the us to halt its plans for the missile shield and appealed to russia not to set up missiles in kaliningrad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking on bbc radio 4 's desert island discs , the former shadow home secretary said the move took " all of my nerve " .
but he could not think of any other way to stop plans to extend terror detention to 42 days " in their tracks " .
mr davis won the haltemprice and howden by-election by a huge majority but effectively ended his frontline career .
the government has since dropped plans to force the amount of time suspects can be held without charge to 42 days through parliament .
mr davis has claimed the decision " vindicated " his resignation but critics say home secretary jacqui smith was forced to climb down in the face of growing opposition from across the political spectrum - including influential labour figures .

" being a backbencher , if you know how to use it , is both powerful and free and that second bit is quite important to me too , " said the mp .

speaking on bbc radio 4 's desert island discs , the former shadow home secretary said the move took " all of my nerve " .
but he could not think of any other way to stop plans to extend terror detention to 42 days " in their tracks " .
mr davis won the haltemprice and howden by-election by a huge majority but effectively ended his frontline career .
the government has since dropped plans to force the amount of time suspects can be held without charge to 42 days through parliament .
mr davis has claimed the decision " vindicated " his resignation but critics say home secretary jacqui smith was forced to climb down in the face of growing opposition from across the political spectrum - including influential labour figures .
parties that are divided lose support and my view was the public would see this as an important stand and that would eclipse the division story david davis " i did n't want to do what i ended up doing .
i am no saint , no hero , " mr davis told desert island discs presenter kirsty young in a show to be broadcast on sunday .
" i did n't want particularly to sacrifice the remainder of my career for anything but i could n't think of any other way to stop this thing in its tracks other than by resigning and making as huge an issue of it as i could . "
' it shocked everybody ' pressed on whether he thought his departure - which came as a surprise to the conservative leader david cameron , who was reportedly furious with him - would damage the party , he said : " i did that calculation .
" i spent a whole weekend thinking about this , literally , just non-stop , and , of course , historically , parties that are divided lose support and my view was the public would see this as an important stand and that would eclipse the division story . "
he added : " this took all my nerve .
i was really scared of this .
it took the whole previous weekend for me to really , really decide .
you can make an intellectual decision but you have to make an emotional decision and , as you say , it shocked everybody . "
he also confessed that the move could have been a mistake , as he may never be able to return to frontline politics .
" this could have been a mistake .
you might calculate that somehow or other 42 days would have died anyway or , alternatively i could have done a better job of defeating them if i was home secretary instead of shadow home secretary which , presumably , would have happened in due course but again i did a calculation . "
speech regret he denied that being a backbencher - even one with a high media profile - was a powerless position .
" being a backbencher , if you know how to use it , is both powerful and free and that second bit is quite important to me too , " said the mp .
he also confessed that he did not do enough preparation for his poorly-received speech to the 2005 tory party conference , widely seen as the moment at which he blew his chance of becoming party leader .
" i simply made the mistake of not spending enough time on that speech .
there 's nobody else to blame but me - i made the mistake and i took the hit and i knew that within 24 hours , " he said .
mr davis , who entered parliament in 1987 after a successful business career , also speaks about his tough upbringing with a single mother and step-father , the influence of his trade unionist grandfather and the search for his birth father , who he met for the first time 25 years ago .
his music choices include dire straits , puccinni and get the party started by pink , a favourite of one of his daughters .

advertisement bridgend mp madeleine moon and the children 's commissioner for wales urged the assembly government to fund a community mental health service .
inadequate mental health care provision at a young offenders ' institution has been criticised as scandalous by wales ' children 's commissioner and an mp .
both keith towler and the mp madeline moon have demanded urgent action by the welsh assembly government to address the issue at parc prison in bridgend .
currently , young offenders with mental health care needs have to be sent to england to serve their sentences .
the assembly government said it was committed to support young offenders .
mr towler and ms moon have called on the assembly government to set up a community mental health service at parc , the only institute for young offenders in wales .
the category b prison , wales ' only private jail , has more than 1,000 male adults and young offenders .
primary health care , such as gp services , is provided to the private prison by primecare , but other health services such as dealing with serious and enduring mental illnesses are the welsh assembly government 's responsibility .
parc prison has never had an in-reach mental health service ... and we have a serious problem here madeleine moon mp , bridgend " parc prison has never had an in-reach mental health service - a child and adolescent mental health service - reaching into the prison and we have a serious problem here , " ms moon told the bbc 's politics show wales .
" parc was opened specifically so that welsh youngsters could serve their sentence in wales as close to their families and communities .
" those most needy youngsters with mental health problems have had to be sent to england , " she added .
ms towler agreed with ms moon 's view that the situation was a national disgrace .
" these are children in need regardless of their behaviour and they deserve a response that can meet that mental health requirement , " said mr towler .
" the stark fact is that we do not have those resources available .
" it is a scandal , " he added .
levels of serious mental health illnesses are believed to be higher among young offenders and female prisoners , according to professionals working in mental health care .
reports dating back to 2002 have outlined concern of a lack of adequate mental health care .
security issues a recent report by the independent monitoring board reiterates the need for adequate mental health care at the prison .
it said : " it is of concern that young people who arrive at parc with serious mental health problems are transferred to establishments in england - often further away from family support . "
it continued : " the board requests the welsh assembly government to fund a community adolescent mental health service as a matter of urgency . "
in a statement , the assembly government said : " where offenders need access to specialist mental healthcare services , they could be referred to glanrhyd hospital , bridgend .
" it is for the health professionals in the prison to determine where it is most appropriate to send the offender given they need to consider security issues . "
it added that the £ 4.5 m it spent each year on children in the criminal justice system showed its commitment to support those young offenders .

both keith towler and the mp madeline moon have demanded urgent action by the welsh assembly government to address the issue at parc prison in bridgend .
currently , young offenders with mental health care needs have to be sent to england to serve their sentences .
the assembly government said it was committed to support young offenders .
mr towler and ms moon have called on the assembly government to set up a community mental health service at parc , the only institute for young offenders in wales .
the category b prison , wales ' only private jail , has more than 1,000 male adults and young offenders .
primary health care , such as gp services , is provided to the private prison by primecare , but other health services such as dealing with serious and enduring mental illnesses are the welsh assembly government 's responsibility .
parc prison has never had an in-reach mental health service ... and we have a serious problem here madeleine moon mp , bridgend " parc prison has never had an in-reach mental health service - a child and adolescent mental health service - reaching into the prison and we have a serious problem here , " ms moon told the bbc 's politics show wales .
" parc was opened specifically so that welsh youngsters could serve their sentence in wales as close to their families and communities .
" those most needy youngsters with mental health problems have had to be sent to england , " she added .
ms towler agreed with ms moon 's view that the situation was a national disgrace .
" these are children in need regardless of their behaviour and they deserve a response that can meet that mental health requirement , " said mr towler .
" the stark fact is that we do not have those resources available .
" it is a scandal , " he added .
levels of serious mental health illnesses are believed to be higher among young offenders and female prisoners , according to professionals working in mental health care .
reports dating back to 2002 have outlined concern of a lack of adequate mental health care .
security issues a recent report by the independent monitoring board reiterates the need for adequate mental health care at the prison .
it said : " it is of concern that young people who arrive at parc with serious mental health problems are transferred to establishments in england - often further away from family support . "
it continued : " the board requests the welsh assembly government to fund a community adolescent mental health service as a matter of urgency . "
in a statement , the assembly government said : " where offenders need access to specialist mental healthcare services , they could be referred to glanrhyd hospital , bridgend .
" it is for the health professionals in the prison to determine where it is most appropriate to send the offender given they need to consider security issues . "
it added that the £ 4.5 m it spent each year on children in the criminal justice system showed its commitment to support those young offenders .

mark ormrod , 24 , of plymouth , devon , lost his limbs on christmas eve when he stepped on a mine in helmand province .
the marine , who was with taunton-based 40 commando , went through months of rehabilitation learning to walk unaided on his artificial legs .
last month he joined 42 commando at bickleigh , plymouth , where he has been given a desk job .
wedding challenge marine ormrod said he was enjoying being back in a military environment , but it was a " challenge " learning a new job .
" i suppose i 'm going to have to come to terms with the fact that i 'm not going to be able to do the job that i was trained to do , " he said .
jackie ormrod says her son 's progress has astounded the family " but i can still support the lads who are doing that job if i 'm back in the uk - and that 's good enough for me . "
after being told he would be eligible for £ 214,000 compensation , the ministry of defence increased the upper limit for all serious injuries and his lump-sum payment has doubled to £ 428,000 .
but the royal marine said his focus has not been on the money , but on getting better , getting back to work and getting married to his fiancee becky next may .
" planning the wedding has been one of the busiest things , but it 's all coming together now , " he said .
his mother jackie said mark 's determination and progress has been astounding .

mark ormrod , 24 , of plymouth , devon , lost his limbs on christmas eve when he stepped on a mine in helmand province .
the marine , who was with taunton-based 40 commando , went through months of rehabilitation learning to walk unaided on his artificial legs .
last month he joined 42 commando at bickleigh , plymouth , where he has been given a desk job .
wedding challenge marine ormrod said he was enjoying being back in a military environment , but it was a " challenge " learning a new job .
" i suppose i 'm going to have to come to terms with the fact that i 'm not going to be able to do the job that i was trained to do , " he said .
jackie ormrod says her son 's progress has astounded the family " but i can still support the lads who are doing that job if i 'm back in the uk - and that 's good enough for me . "
after being told he would be eligible for £ 214,000 compensation , the ministry of defence increased the upper limit for all serious injuries and his lump-sum payment has doubled to £ 428,000 .
but the royal marine said his focus has not been on the money , but on getting better , getting back to work and getting married to his fiancee becky next may .
" planning the wedding has been one of the busiest things , but it 's all coming together now , " he said .
his mother jackie said mark 's determination and progress has been astounding .

mark ormrod , 24 , of plymouth , devon , lost his limbs on christmas eve when he stepped on a mine in helmand province .
