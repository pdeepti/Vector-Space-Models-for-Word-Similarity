ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .
at least four members of that crew are said to be ill and in urgent need of medical treatment after being kidnapped in nearby waters .

after their meeting , paulson and glos expressed hopes that agreement might finally be reached in the long-bogged down trade talks . the two ministers likewise worried aloud about high world crude oil prices and the consequences for the global economy .
agreement in geneva would provide a positive signal for the global economy , said glos after the meeting . " not on the backs of german agriculture " ministers from the 30 main trading nations will meet to discuss the wto 's so-called doha round , a deal to further liberalize world trade that has been hung up over the last four years .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations blame western agricultural subsidies for food shortages agricultural subsidies provided to farmers by the united states and the european union are distorting world food prices , critics from some developing nations claim . paulson tuesday said a deal to further liberalize world trade would help to ease food prices on global markets by reducing trade barriers . glos likewise added that high energy prices were affecting food prices .
the best way to cheaper oil and gas prices should come from technology that creates independence from oil and natural gas , he said . german chancellor angela merkel , speaking to farmers in berlin , made clear tuesday that german agriculture would not bear the cost of striking such a deal . " the german government will only agree if we receive a fair and balanced offer , " merkel said .
an agreement would not be reached " on the back of german agriculture , " she said , adding that european agriculture had made its contribution to the liberalization of world trade . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .

the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.07.2008 opinion : germany no role model for gender equality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany on tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a law enshrining equality of the sexes .
but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .
" together with us they were the team in the last two , three years who were the most consistent , " he said .
goal should n't have happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann felt the referee was biased lehmann said that he was disappointed with the goal .
" as a player you always say ' if i had done this or done that ' .
i am not the kind of person who blames others .
if i had probably waited a bit longer or had done something different -lrb- fernando -rrb- torres would probably not have scored . "
he said that he did not know whether he would continue playing for germany .
" i have not made my mind up , i will do that in a little while and then i will let my coaches know and my teammates . "
punished for mistakes other german players agreed with lehmann 's assessment of the referee .
striker lukas podolski said that he did not think the referee had a good game .
" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .
" but we must be honest , that is not why we lost the game .
we did not do enough to win the european championship . "
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger said he felt the referee could have given germany a little bit more , but also said that the team could n't blame the loss on bad calls .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished , " he said .
" the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes .
we made too many - that is why we lost . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .
the new settlements procedure will come into force as soon as it is published in the eu 's official journal . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .
the new settlements procedure will come into force as soon as it is published in the eu 's official journal . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .
the new settlements procedure will come into force as soon as it is published in the eu 's official journal . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .

tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .

tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .

it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified .

" europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .
" together with us they were the team in the last two , three years who were the most consistent , " he said .
goal should n't have happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann felt the referee was biased lehmann said that he was disappointed with the goal .
" as a player you always say ' if i had done this or done that ' .
i am not the kind of person who blames others .
if i had probably waited a bit longer or had done something different -lrb- fernando -rrb- torres would probably not have scored . "
he said that he did not know whether he would continue playing for germany .
" i have not made my mind up , i will do that in a little while and then i will let my coaches know and my teammates . "
punished for mistakes other german players agreed with lehmann 's assessment of the referee .
striker lukas podolski said that he did not think the referee had a good game .
" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .
" but we must be honest , that is not why we lost the game .
we did not do enough to win the european championship . "
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger said he felt the referee could have given germany a little bit more , but also said that the team could n't blame the loss on bad calls .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished , " he said .
" the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes .
we made too many - that is why we lost . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .
meanwhile , authorities in britain say a strict smoking ban introduced a year ago in all restaurants , bars and public places has prompted at least 400,000 people to kick the habit .
a study by britain 's cancer association and various pharmaceutical companies showed the smoking ban could prevent the death of 40,000 people in the coming ten years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?

she foresees two other options for the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .
meanwhile , authorities in britain say a strict smoking ban introduced a year ago in all restaurants , bars and public places has prompted at least 400,000 people to kick the habit .
a study by britain 's cancer association and various pharmaceutical companies showed the smoking ban could prevent the death of 40,000 people in the coming ten years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .

we did not do enough to win the european championship . "

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .

after their meeting , paulson and glos expressed hopes that agreement might finally be reached in the long-bogged down trade talks . the two ministers likewise worried aloud about high world crude oil prices and the consequences for the global economy .
agreement in geneva would provide a positive signal for the global economy , said glos after the meeting . " not on the backs of german agriculture " ministers from the 30 main trading nations will meet to discuss the wto 's so-called doha round , a deal to further liberalize world trade that has been hung up over the last four years .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations blame western agricultural subsidies for food shortages agricultural subsidies provided to farmers by the united states and the european union are distorting world food prices , critics from some developing nations claim . paulson tuesday said a deal to further liberalize world trade would help to ease food prices on global markets by reducing trade barriers . glos likewise added that high energy prices were affecting food prices .
the best way to cheaper oil and gas prices should come from technology that creates independence from oil and natural gas , he said . german chancellor angela merkel , speaking to farmers in berlin , made clear tuesday that german agriculture would not bear the cost of striking such a deal . " the german government will only agree if we receive a fair and balanced offer , " merkel said .
an agreement would not be reached " on the back of german agriculture , " she said , adding that european agriculture had made its contribution to the liberalization of world trade . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .
prime minister donald tusk said ratification of the lisbon treaty was in poland 's interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski rained on sarkozy 's eu party kaczynski was quoted by the daily dziennik on tuesday as saying he would not endorse the treaty until ireland changed its stance and made the decision on its own , without giving in to pressure from other eu members . reform treaty a priority kaczynski 's move follows a statement by german president horst koehler on monday that he was suspending ratification of the treaty following a request to wait from germany 's constitutional court . german opponents of the reform treaty went to the court demanding injunctions against its ratification .
it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified . " there will be no enlargement of europe if we can not reform its institutions , " he said . attack on eu trade chief sparks anger the lisbon treaty was n't the only issue that threw a damper on what was billed as a proud day for france when it took over the helm of the eu from slovenia . sarkozy sparked outrage in the eu after he criticized eu trade chief peter mandelson in a french television interview on monday , suggesting mandelson was trying to force an unfavorable trade deal on europe . sarkozy spent his monday television appearance criticizing many aspects of the eu , such as the expertise of the european commission 's fisheries experts , the eu 's value-added tax rigour , the european central bank 's refusal to lower interest rates and mandelson 's policy on trade negotiations . " europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .
we have to change the way it is being put together , " sarkozy said . spat with trade commissioner sullies opening day sarkozy has long been critical of the british eu trade commissioner , accusing him of offering too generous concessions on farming in fraught negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson 's trade dealings were singled out by sarkozy " president sarkozy 's further attack on peter mandelson , as eu trade negotiator , as well as pascal lamy , is disappointing .
such criticism is wrong and unjustified , " mandelson 's spokesman said in a statement . " at a difficult time in world trade negotiations , the eu needs to maintain its unity .
the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will continue to work in the interests of all member states to get a fair and balanced outcome in the doha round " of world trade talks , the spokesman said . sarkozy , whose popularity is sinking at home , has said he hopes to be able to concentrate on five main areas as head of the eu presidency - immigration , defense , energy and the environment , agriculture , and the most high-profile project : the july 13 launch of a new union for the mediterranean . but his top priority will now be to salvage the lisbon treaty , he said monday , adding that eu countries must continue ratifying the charter . sarkozy is due to travel to ireland on july 11 to hear first hand the concerns of irish voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .
at least four members of that crew are said to be ill and in urgent need of medical treatment after being kidnapped in nearby waters .
talks for their release are in deadlock . another cargo ship captured at the same time as the mv lehmann timber was released after the pirates received a ransom of one million dollars . rampant piracy on the somalian seas piracy is rife off the coast of the relatively lawless horn of africa nation .
cargo ships and luxury yachts have been targeted by heavily-armed pirates , who then hold the crew ransom . the most high-profile case in recent months involved the capture of a luxury french yacht in april .
french troops rescued the hostages and captured six of the pirates , although another six are believed to have escaped . the united nations security council recently approved incursions into somali waters to curb piracy , which the weak transitional government , currently engaged in countering a bloody insurgency , is powerless to prevent . somalia , whose coast commands access to the red sea , has been in a state of anarchy since the overthrow of dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .
the new settlements procedure will come into force as soon as it is published in the eu 's official journal . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .
among the many events scheduled for the french eu presidency , 22 involve the participation of one or more senior government members , 92 are international conferences where one government representative is present and 20 are informal ministerial conferences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 france 's eu presidency gets off to a rocky start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eiffel tower 's calm blue eu colors belied the storm gathering in paris ' political heart france 's six-month leadership of the eu began turbulently tuesday , july 1 with president sarkozy involved in a bitter war of words with the eu 's trade chief and poland refusing to sign the embattled lisbon treaty . french president nicolas sarkozy faced mounting troubles as his country assumed the rotating six-month eu presidency on tuesday , july 1 with grand pledges of moving beyond the crisis triggered by the recent irish rejection of the treaty meant to reform the 27-nation bloc . the first sign of trouble came early tuesday when polish president lech kaczynski kaczynski said it would be " pointless " signing the lisbon treaty following its rejection by irish voters in a referendum on june 12 .
the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .

between december and may , german unemployment recorded an average monthly drop of 46,000 . the release of the latest german unemployment data follows figures also published tuesday showing a bigger-than-expected pickup in retail sales in the nation helped along by higher pay settlements and the improvement in the labor market . retail sales rose a real 1.3 percent in may , the statistics office said , increasing by 0.7 percent on the year as german consumers apparently also shrugged off the threat posed by surging inflation . economists had predicted a monthly rise of 0.5 percent with a 1 percent fall for the year . a positive revision to growth projections indeed , despite key forward-looking sentiment surveys pointing to a darkening economic mood in the country and inflation climbing to record levels , economists have revised up their previous 2008 german growth projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a positive export outlook is buoying the economy for now in particular , this follows strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia , eastern europe and the middle east , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in the positive revision . instead of a previously projected 1.9 percent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 percent growth rate this year .
the german economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2007 . the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said tuesday it now expects the nation 's 2008 growth rate to hit 2.7 percent after a strong start to the year . the latest labor agency data also showed the number of job vacancies had climbed from 579,180 in may to 596,269 in june . the best times are now behind economists , however , are predicting that german growth is likely to lose ground in the run-up to the end of the year , with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow closer to 1 percent in 2009 and consequently undercutting hiring . " the numbers out of work -lrb- in june -rrb- have been a positive surprise , " said eckart tuchfeld , economist with commerzbank ag .
" nevertheless , at least for the medium term the best times are now behind the labor market . " based on the more politically sensitive seasonally unadjusted terms , tuesday 's figures showed german unemployment falling in june , with the numbers out of work dropping by 123,000 to 3.16 million . this brought the seasonally unadjusted jobless rate down to 7.5 percent . the jobless numbers in june were 528,000 fewer than in the same month last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.8 percent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .

and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.07.2008 opinion : germany no role model for gender equality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany on tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a law enshrining equality of the sexes .
but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 france 's eu presidency gets off to a rocky start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eiffel tower 's calm blue eu colors belied the storm gathering in paris ' political heart france 's six-month leadership of the eu began turbulently tuesday , july 1 with president sarkozy involved in a bitter war of words with the eu 's trade chief and poland refusing to sign the embattled lisbon treaty . french president nicolas sarkozy faced mounting troubles as his country assumed the rotating six-month eu presidency on tuesday , july 1 with grand pledges of moving beyond the crisis triggered by the recent irish rejection of the treaty meant to reform the 27-nation bloc . the first sign of trouble came early tuesday when polish president lech kaczynski kaczynski said it would be " pointless " signing the lisbon treaty following its rejection by irish voters in a referendum on june 12 .
the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .
prime minister donald tusk said ratification of the lisbon treaty was in poland 's interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski rained on sarkozy 's eu party kaczynski was quoted by the daily dziennik on tuesday as saying he would not endorse the treaty until ireland changed its stance and made the decision on its own , without giving in to pressure from other eu members . reform treaty a priority kaczynski 's move follows a statement by german president horst koehler on monday that he was suspending ratification of the treaty following a request to wait from germany 's constitutional court . german opponents of the reform treaty went to the court demanding injunctions against its ratification .
it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified . " there will be no enlargement of europe if we can not reform its institutions , " he said . attack on eu trade chief sparks anger the lisbon treaty was n't the only issue that threw a damper on what was billed as a proud day for france when it took over the helm of the eu from slovenia . sarkozy sparked outrage in the eu after he criticized eu trade chief peter mandelson in a french television interview on monday , suggesting mandelson was trying to force an unfavorable trade deal on europe . sarkozy spent his monday television appearance criticizing many aspects of the eu , such as the expertise of the european commission 's fisheries experts , the eu 's value-added tax rigour , the european central bank 's refusal to lower interest rates and mandelson 's policy on trade negotiations . " europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .
we have to change the way it is being put together , " sarkozy said . spat with trade commissioner sullies opening day sarkozy has long been critical of the british eu trade commissioner , accusing him of offering too generous concessions on farming in fraught negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson 's trade dealings were singled out by sarkozy " president sarkozy 's further attack on peter mandelson , as eu trade negotiator , as well as pascal lamy , is disappointing .
such criticism is wrong and unjustified , " mandelson 's spokesman said in a statement . " at a difficult time in world trade negotiations , the eu needs to maintain its unity .
the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will continue to work in the interests of all member states to get a fair and balanced outcome in the doha round " of world trade talks , the spokesman said . sarkozy , whose popularity is sinking at home , has said he hopes to be able to concentrate on five main areas as head of the eu presidency - immigration , defense , energy and the environment , agriculture , and the most high-profile project : the july 13 launch of a new union for the mediterranean . but his top priority will now be to salvage the lisbon treaty , he said monday , adding that eu countries must continue ratifying the charter . sarkozy is due to travel to ireland on july 11 to hear first hand the concerns of irish voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .

between december and may , german unemployment recorded an average monthly drop of 46,000 . the release of the latest german unemployment data follows figures also published tuesday showing a bigger-than-expected pickup in retail sales in the nation helped along by higher pay settlements and the improvement in the labor market . retail sales rose a real 1.3 percent in may , the statistics office said , increasing by 0.7 percent on the year as german consumers apparently also shrugged off the threat posed by surging inflation . economists had predicted a monthly rise of 0.5 percent with a 1 percent fall for the year . a positive revision to growth projections indeed , despite key forward-looking sentiment surveys pointing to a darkening economic mood in the country and inflation climbing to record levels , economists have revised up their previous 2008 german growth projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a positive export outlook is buoying the economy for now in particular , this follows strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia , eastern europe and the middle east , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in the positive revision . instead of a previously projected 1.9 percent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 percent growth rate this year .
the german economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2007 . the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said tuesday it now expects the nation 's 2008 growth rate to hit 2.7 percent after a strong start to the year . the latest labor agency data also showed the number of job vacancies had climbed from 579,180 in may to 596,269 in june . the best times are now behind economists , however , are predicting that german growth is likely to lose ground in the run-up to the end of the year , with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow closer to 1 percent in 2009 and consequently undercutting hiring .

the german economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2007 . the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said tuesday it now expects the nation 's 2008 growth rate to hit 2.7 percent after a strong start to the year . the latest labor agency data also showed the number of job vacancies had climbed from 579,180 in may to 596,269 in june . the best times are now behind economists , however , are predicting that german growth is likely to lose ground in the run-up to the end of the year , with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow closer to 1 percent in 2009 and consequently undercutting hiring .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .

but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .

she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .

europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .

one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .

one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

between december and may , german unemployment recorded an average monthly drop of 46,000 . the release of the latest german unemployment data follows figures also published tuesday showing a bigger-than-expected pickup in retail sales in the nation helped along by higher pay settlements and the improvement in the labor market . retail sales rose a real 1.3 percent in may , the statistics office said , increasing by 0.7 percent on the year as german consumers apparently also shrugged off the threat posed by surging inflation . economists had predicted a monthly rise of 0.5 percent with a 1 percent fall for the year . a positive revision to growth projections indeed , despite key forward-looking sentiment surveys pointing to a darkening economic mood in the country and inflation climbing to record levels , economists have revised up their previous 2008 german growth projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a positive export outlook is buoying the economy for now in particular , this follows strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia , eastern europe and the middle east , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in the positive revision . instead of a previously projected 1.9 percent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 percent growth rate this year .
the german economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2007 . the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said tuesday it now expects the nation 's 2008 growth rate to hit 2.7 percent after a strong start to the year . the latest labor agency data also showed the number of job vacancies had climbed from 579,180 in may to 596,269 in june . the best times are now behind economists , however , are predicting that german growth is likely to lose ground in the run-up to the end of the year , with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow closer to 1 percent in 2009 and consequently undercutting hiring . " the numbers out of work -lrb- in june -rrb- have been a positive surprise , " said eckart tuchfeld , economist with commerzbank ag .
" nevertheless , at least for the medium term the best times are now behind the labor market . " based on the more politically sensitive seasonally unadjusted terms , tuesday 's figures showed german unemployment falling in june , with the numbers out of work dropping by 123,000 to 3.16 million . this brought the seasonally unadjusted jobless rate down to 7.5 percent . the jobless numbers in june were 528,000 fewer than in the same month last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.8 percent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .
meanwhile , authorities in britain say a strict smoking ban introduced a year ago in all restaurants , bars and public places has prompted at least 400,000 people to kick the habit .

the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .

tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .

bildunterschrift : noting that the eu court had backed germany 's legal position , a spokesman for the finance ministry said the return of the funds to deutsche post would be carried out in the current budget .
tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .

tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.07.2008 opinion : germany no role model for gender equality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany on tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a law enshrining equality of the sexes .
but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .
among the many events scheduled for the french eu presidency , 22 involve the participation of one or more senior government members , 92 are international conferences where one government representative is present and 20 are informal ministerial conferences .
these events in themselves , which were proposed by france , not the eu , will cost 82 million euros , mediapart reported . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental groups , however , are worried about toxic leaks into the earth . the plan is to pump 60,000 tons of greenhouse gas into porous , salt water-filled rock at depths of more than 600 meters -lrb- 2,000 feet -rrb- over the next two years , said germany 's national geo-science institute , the project 's initiator . the 20 million euro project , dubbed co2sink , was officially launched on monday , june 30 in ketzin near potsdam , with the first injection of carbon dioxide below the surface of the earth .
carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change .

while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .

the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
government welcomes ruling despite financial burden the ruling was welcomed by the german government , in spite of the fact that it posed a substantial additional burden on state the finances .
bildunterschrift : noting that the eu court had backed germany 's legal position , a spokesman for the finance ministry said the return of the funds to deutsche post would be carried out in the current budget .
tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .
the plaintiffs argued that deutsche post was covering the loss generated by its door-to-door parcels service with the state support it was given for delivering letters , and was therefore effectively benefiting from unfair state aid .
commission ruled post had broken competition rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ruled that deutsche post had broken the law in 2001 , the commission ruled that deutsche post had indeed broken eu competition rules , and ordered it to pay the german government 572 million euros , which the commission calculated it had received in aid .
tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .
the commission said it would study the verdict " carefully " before deciding whether to file an appeal to the european court of justice .
it has two months to do so . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
government welcomes ruling despite financial burden the ruling was welcomed by the german government , in spite of the fact that it posed a substantial additional burden on state the finances .
bildunterschrift : noting that the eu court had backed germany 's legal position , a spokesman for the finance ministry said the return of the funds to deutsche post would be carried out in the current budget .
tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .
the plaintiffs argued that deutsche post was covering the loss generated by its door-to-door parcels service with the state support it was given for delivering letters , and was therefore effectively benefiting from unfair state aid .
commission ruled post had broken competition rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ruled that deutsche post had broken the law in 2001 , the commission ruled that deutsche post had indeed broken eu competition rules , and ordered it to pay the german government 572 million euros , which the commission calculated it had received in aid .
tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .
the commission said it would study the verdict " carefully " before deciding whether to file an appeal to the european court of justice .
it has two months to do so . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

after their meeting , paulson and glos expressed hopes that agreement might finally be reached in the long-bogged down trade talks . the two ministers likewise worried aloud about high world crude oil prices and the consequences for the global economy .
agreement in geneva would provide a positive signal for the global economy , said glos after the meeting . " not on the backs of german agriculture " ministers from the 30 main trading nations will meet to discuss the wto 's so-called doha round , a deal to further liberalize world trade that has been hung up over the last four years .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations blame western agricultural subsidies for food shortages agricultural subsidies provided to farmers by the united states and the european union are distorting world food prices , critics from some developing nations claim . paulson tuesday said a deal to further liberalize world trade would help to ease food prices on global markets by reducing trade barriers . glos likewise added that high energy prices were affecting food prices .
the best way to cheaper oil and gas prices should come from technology that creates independence from oil and natural gas , he said . german chancellor angela merkel , speaking to farmers in berlin , made clear tuesday that german agriculture would not bear the cost of striking such a deal . " the german government will only agree if we receive a fair and balanced offer , " merkel said .
an agreement would not be reached " on the back of german agriculture , " she said , adding that european agriculture had made its contribution to the liberalization of world trade . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .
meanwhile , authorities in britain say a strict smoking ban introduced a year ago in all restaurants , bars and public places has prompted at least 400,000 people to kick the habit .
a study by britain 's cancer association and various pharmaceutical companies showed the smoking ban could prevent the death of 40,000 people in the coming ten years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.07.2008 opinion : germany no role model for gender equality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany on tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a law enshrining equality of the sexes .
but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change . " the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .

while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .
at least four members of that crew are said to be ill and in urgent need of medical treatment after being kidnapped in nearby waters .
talks for their release are in deadlock . another cargo ship captured at the same time as the mv lehmann timber was released after the pirates received a ransom of one million dollars . rampant piracy on the somalian seas piracy is rife off the coast of the relatively lawless horn of africa nation .
cargo ships and luxury yachts have been targeted by heavily-armed pirates , who then hold the crew ransom . the most high-profile case in recent months involved the capture of a luxury french yacht in april .
french troops rescued the hostages and captured six of the pirates , although another six are believed to have escaped . the united nations security council recently approved incursions into somali waters to curb piracy , which the weak transitional government , currently engaged in countering a bloody insurgency , is powerless to prevent . somalia , whose coast commands access to the red sea , has been in a state of anarchy since the overthrow of dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned , is harmful to the environment and considered to be the leading cause of climate change .

he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .

for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .
at least four members of that crew are said to be ill and in urgent need of medical treatment after being kidnapped in nearby waters .
talks for their release are in deadlock . another cargo ship captured at the same time as the mv lehmann timber was released after the pirates received a ransom of one million dollars . rampant piracy on the somalian seas piracy is rife off the coast of the relatively lawless horn of africa nation .
cargo ships and luxury yachts have been targeted by heavily-armed pirates , who then hold the crew ransom . the most high-profile case in recent months involved the capture of a luxury french yacht in april .
french troops rescued the hostages and captured six of the pirates , although another six are believed to have escaped . the united nations security council recently approved incursions into somali waters to curb piracy , which the weak transitional government , currently engaged in countering a bloody insurgency , is powerless to prevent . somalia , whose coast commands access to the red sea , has been in a state of anarchy since the overthrow of dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .
officials in brussels stressed that the settlement procedure was not a way to introduce plea-bargaining , but was simply a way to reward cooperative behavior .
the eu already has a policy of rewarding companies who reveal the existence of a cartel by granting them a partial or total amnesty .
the new settlements procedure will come into force as soon as it is published in the eu 's official journal . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

after their meeting , paulson and glos expressed hopes that agreement might finally be reached in the long-bogged down trade talks . the two ministers likewise worried aloud about high world crude oil prices and the consequences for the global economy .
agreement in geneva would provide a positive signal for the global economy , said glos after the meeting . " not on the backs of german agriculture " ministers from the 30 main trading nations will meet to discuss the wto 's so-called doha round , a deal to further liberalize world trade that has been hung up over the last four years .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations blame western agricultural subsidies for food shortages agricultural subsidies provided to farmers by the united states and the european union are distorting world food prices , critics from some developing nations claim . paulson tuesday said a deal to further liberalize world trade would help to ease food prices on global markets by reducing trade barriers . glos likewise added that high energy prices were affecting food prices .
the best way to cheaper oil and gas prices should come from technology that creates independence from oil and natural gas , he said . german chancellor angela merkel , speaking to farmers in berlin , made clear tuesday that german agriculture would not bear the cost of striking such a deal . " the german government will only agree if we receive a fair and balanced offer , " merkel said .
an agreement would not be reached " on the back of german agriculture , " she said , adding that european agriculture had made its contribution to the liberalization of world trade . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .
" together with us they were the team in the last two , three years who were the most consistent , " he said .

he said that he did not know whether he would continue playing for germany .
" i have not made my mind up , i will do that in a little while and then i will let my coaches know and my teammates . "

striker lukas podolski said that he did not think the referee had a good game .
" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .
" but we must be honest , that is not why we lost the game .
we did not do enough to win the european championship . "
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger said he felt the referee could have given germany a little bit more , but also said that the team could n't blame the loss on bad calls .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished , " he said .

between december and may , german unemployment recorded an average monthly drop of 46,000 . the release of the latest german unemployment data follows figures also published tuesday showing a bigger-than-expected pickup in retail sales in the nation helped along by higher pay settlements and the improvement in the labor market . retail sales rose a real 1.3 percent in may , the statistics office said , increasing by 0.7 percent on the year as german consumers apparently also shrugged off the threat posed by surging inflation . economists had predicted a monthly rise of 0.5 percent with a 1 percent fall for the year . a positive revision to growth projections indeed , despite key forward-looking sentiment surveys pointing to a darkening economic mood in the country and inflation climbing to record levels , economists have revised up their previous 2008 german growth projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a positive export outlook is buoying the economy for now in particular , this follows strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia , eastern europe and the middle east , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in the positive revision . instead of a previously projected 1.9 percent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 percent growth rate this year .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .
among the many events scheduled for the french eu presidency , 22 involve the participation of one or more senior government members , 92 are international conferences where one government representative is present and 20 are informal ministerial conferences .
these events in themselves , which were proposed by france , not the eu , will cost 82 million euros , mediapart reported . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .
prime minister donald tusk said ratification of the lisbon treaty was in poland 's interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski rained on sarkozy 's eu party kaczynski was quoted by the daily dziennik on tuesday as saying he would not endorse the treaty until ireland changed its stance and made the decision on its own , without giving in to pressure from other eu members . reform treaty a priority kaczynski 's move follows a statement by german president horst koehler on monday that he was suspending ratification of the treaty following a request to wait from germany 's constitutional court . german opponents of the reform treaty went to the court demanding injunctions against its ratification .
it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified . " there will be no enlargement of europe if we can not reform its institutions , " he said . attack on eu trade chief sparks anger the lisbon treaty was n't the only issue that threw a damper on what was billed as a proud day for france when it took over the helm of the eu from slovenia . sarkozy sparked outrage in the eu after he criticized eu trade chief peter mandelson in a french television interview on monday , suggesting mandelson was trying to force an unfavorable trade deal on europe . sarkozy spent his monday television appearance criticizing many aspects of the eu , such as the expertise of the european commission 's fisheries experts , the eu 's value-added tax rigour , the european central bank 's refusal to lower interest rates and mandelson 's policy on trade negotiations . " europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .
we have to change the way it is being put together , " sarkozy said . spat with trade commissioner sullies opening day sarkozy has long been critical of the british eu trade commissioner , accusing him of offering too generous concessions on farming in fraught negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson 's trade dealings were singled out by sarkozy " president sarkozy 's further attack on peter mandelson , as eu trade negotiator , as well as pascal lamy , is disappointing .
such criticism is wrong and unjustified , " mandelson 's spokesman said in a statement . " at a difficult time in world trade negotiations , the eu needs to maintain its unity .
the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will continue to work in the interests of all member states to get a fair and balanced outcome in the doha round " of world trade talks , the spokesman said . sarkozy , whose popularity is sinking at home , has said he hopes to be able to concentrate on five main areas as head of the eu presidency - immigration , defense , energy and the environment , agriculture , and the most high-profile project : the july 13 launch of a new union for the mediterranean . but his top priority will now be to salvage the lisbon treaty , he said monday , adding that eu countries must continue ratifying the charter . sarkozy is due to travel to ireland on july 11 to hear first hand the concerns of irish voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .
among the many events scheduled for the french eu presidency , 22 involve the participation of one or more senior government members , 92 are international conferences where one government representative is present and 20 are informal ministerial conferences .
these events in themselves , which were proposed by france , not the eu , will cost 82 million euros , mediapart reported . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?

dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?

between december and may , german unemployment recorded an average monthly drop of 46,000 . the release of the latest german unemployment data follows figures also published tuesday showing a bigger-than-expected pickup in retail sales in the nation helped along by higher pay settlements and the improvement in the labor market . retail sales rose a real 1.3 percent in may , the statistics office said , increasing by 0.7 percent on the year as german consumers apparently also shrugged off the threat posed by surging inflation . economists had predicted a monthly rise of 0.5 percent with a 1 percent fall for the year . a positive revision to growth projections indeed , despite key forward-looking sentiment surveys pointing to a darkening economic mood in the country and inflation climbing to record levels , economists have revised up their previous 2008 german growth projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a positive export outlook is buoying the economy for now in particular , this follows strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia , eastern europe and the middle east , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in the positive revision . instead of a previously projected 1.9 percent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 percent growth rate this year .
the german economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2007 . the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said tuesday it now expects the nation 's 2008 growth rate to hit 2.7 percent after a strong start to the year . the latest labor agency data also showed the number of job vacancies had climbed from 579,180 in may to 596,269 in june . the best times are now behind economists , however , are predicting that german growth is likely to lose ground in the run-up to the end of the year , with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow closer to 1 percent in 2009 and consequently undercutting hiring . " the numbers out of work -lrb- in june -rrb- have been a positive surprise , " said eckart tuchfeld , economist with commerzbank ag .
" nevertheless , at least for the medium term the best times are now behind the labor market . " based on the more politically sensitive seasonally unadjusted terms , tuesday 's figures showed german unemployment falling in june , with the numbers out of work dropping by 123,000 to 3.16 million . this brought the seasonally unadjusted jobless rate down to 7.5 percent . the jobless numbers in june were 528,000 fewer than in the same month last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.8 percent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 french eu presidency faces uphill struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy currently does n't have so much to smile about ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty has presented france with a weighty challenge at the start of its six-month presidency .
dw-world.de asked eu experts about the options for the months ahead . just days after taking over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , french president nicolas sarkozy is set to fly to dublin for talks over the way forward after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
it 's a crucial visit , according to hugo brady , from the london-based centre for european reform .
and one that the irishman believes could go either way .
" sarkozy is unpredictable .
the trip could make things worse if he 's impolitic .
but it could also be the start of a way back , an escape from europaralysis . "
the reform treaty , which , in part , aims to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc , needs the agreement of all members to come into effect .
so what options are open to the eu ?
eu leaders tired of stop-start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december eu leaders thought they 'd finally put their troubles behind them a consensus seems to be forming among european leaders behind the idea of holding a second referendum in ireland , according to marco incerti , research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
he believes there is a greater will now to press ahead with ratification than after the french and dutch rejections of the european constitution in 2005 " if only out of fatigue . "
" leaders in europe are fed up .
they realize this is also beginning to have a cost for them .
they have less time to devote to the real issues .
europe is losing ground .
eu citizens are not very happy with this situation .
there is a need to move on and focus on the big issues and close the debate on the institutions , " said incerti . this push is being spearheaded by france and germany .
one of the unfortunate outcomes of the irish no-vote , according to incerti , is that the crisis threatens to dominate the french eu presidency which had sought to focus on key priorities such as immigration , energy and climate change – issues that he believes are much closer to eu citizens ' hearts . germany and france : good cop , bad cop ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may , merkel was awarded germany 's charlemagne prize for brokering lisbon tanja börzel , an expert in european integration at berlin 's free university , believes that chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy could be the right team to negotiate the way out of this tricky situation .
" germany and france seem to be playing good cop , bad cop .
merkel is very adept diplomatically .
he is less so .
sarkozy has been making the points and she has been smoothing the waves . "
but the german professor believes that france and germany can not do it alone , but need to search for solutions with their european partners , including the irish government . asking the irish to vote on the lisbon treaty for a second time is , however , a high-risk strategy .
in addition , it is not necessarily clear what voters would need to be offered to secure their approval .
the difficulty of a second vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the irish really be asked to go through the motions again ?
brady , from the uk 's centre for european reform , believes that it would be extremely difficult to justify a second referendum to voters .
but he believes that a single document recognizing ireland 's sovereignty in key areas , such as defense , tax harmonization and abortion alongside a guarantee of a national commissioner for all eu countries might give pro-campaigners a fighting chance . at least part of the reason for irish rejection of the lisbon treaty was misinformation spread by the no campaign .
many opt-outs in areas said to be under threat had already been secured for ireland in previous european treaties .
but the fact that the campaign resonated with voters also revealed how little was known among the general populace about what they and their governments had already signed up to .
it also pointed up an underlying mistrust about the european union , in general .
no matter if referenda are generally agreed to be poor instruments for deciding on such complex documents as the lisbon treaty , the specter of forcing a second vote in order to secure the desired result merely threatens to compound the eu 's perceived democratic deficits .
paradoxically , the lisbon treaty actually plug some of the gaps by giving the european parliament a stronger say and allowing national parliaments direct input into the legislative process . while incerti believes the issue of legitimacy must be resolved in the long-term , he believes eu leaders will seek a short-term strategy to deal with the situation in ireland .
" i do n't think they will deal with this question this time round .
but in the long term there could be a need for them to listen a bit more , for the european council to be more in tune with the worries and preoccupations of europeans .
and much more intense communication efforts are needed .
there is a need to get people informed at school , not telling them it 's all wonderful , but letting them know what it 's about , " said incerti . drastic solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the no campaign 's arguments were unfounded another more draconian short-term solution to the irish no vote has also been floated by the ceps think tank .
this would involve the rest of the states re-ratifying a consolidated form of the lisbon treaty , creating a whole new european union , and then inviting ireland to rejoin the bloc .
" this is a technical trick and it would involve de facto sidelining ireland and putting as much pressure as possible on it to ratify . "
however , he concedes that this strategy is likely to work vis-a-vis the government , but not vis-a-vis its citizens , who have a constitutional right to a referendum on the lisbon treaty . and sarkozy 's problems do not stop at ireland .
even if its voters could be persuaded to vote yes a second time around , seven other countries still have to ratify the treaty .
in the czech republic this is already proving problematic .
the process has currently been suspended awaiting a court ruling on the treaty 's constitutionality . life beyond the lisbon treaty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do european citizens have an appetite for a stronger eu ?
would the eu be dead in the water without the lisbon treaty ?
tanja börzel says no .
she foresees two other options for the bloc .
one is the idea of a two-speed europe where a core group of states would proceed to greater integration .
another possibility is that groups of nations would work together and deepen their co-operation in certain policy areas , for example on defense and security or social and labor issues .
there are already precedents for this way of working , for example , the introduction of passport-free travel among the schengen nations and of the single european currency in the eurozone .
" the second model has the advantage that it would n't split europe into a core and a periphery , " said börzel .
however , she argues that without the lisbon treaty the european union would not have the legal status to play a stronger role on the global stage .
" against the backdrop of a weakened united states , the eu needs to be able to demonstrate a stronger presence on the world stage whether that be on climate change , or fighting poverty or human rights , " she said .
the ceps researcher marco incerti also does not believe that the european union would grind to a halt without the lisbon treaty .
nevertheless , he argues that it would enable the eu to improve its work .
" this has not been as successful in recent years .
it has not been able , for example , to represent european energy interests vis-a-vis russia .
the eu could continue to work as well as before but the thing should be how we can improve the work of the eu , " said incerti . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after their meeting , paulson and glos expressed hopes that agreement might finally be reached in the long-bogged down trade talks . the two ministers likewise worried aloud about high world crude oil prices and the consequences for the global economy .
agreement in geneva would provide a positive signal for the global economy , said glos after the meeting . " not on the backs of german agriculture " ministers from the 30 main trading nations will meet to discuss the wto 's so-called doha round , a deal to further liberalize world trade that has been hung up over the last four years .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations blame western agricultural subsidies for food shortages agricultural subsidies provided to farmers by the united states and the european union are distorting world food prices , critics from some developing nations claim . paulson tuesday said a deal to further liberalize world trade would help to ease food prices on global markets by reducing trade barriers . glos likewise added that high energy prices were affecting food prices .
the best way to cheaper oil and gas prices should come from technology that creates independence from oil and natural gas , he said . german chancellor angela merkel , speaking to farmers in berlin , made clear tuesday that german agriculture would not bear the cost of striking such a deal . " the german government will only agree if we receive a fair and balanced offer , " merkel said .
an agreement would not be reached " on the back of german agriculture , " she said , adding that european agriculture had made its contribution to the liberalization of world trade . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2008 france 's eu presidency gets off to a rocky start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eiffel tower 's calm blue eu colors belied the storm gathering in paris ' political heart france 's six-month leadership of the eu began turbulently tuesday , july 1 with president sarkozy involved in a bitter war of words with the eu 's trade chief and poland refusing to sign the embattled lisbon treaty . french president nicolas sarkozy faced mounting troubles as his country assumed the rotating six-month eu presidency on tuesday , july 1 with grand pledges of moving beyond the crisis triggered by the recent irish rejection of the treaty meant to reform the 27-nation bloc . the first sign of trouble came early tuesday when polish president lech kaczynski kaczynski said it would be " pointless " signing the lisbon treaty following its rejection by irish voters in a referendum on june 12 .
the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .
prime minister donald tusk said ratification of the lisbon treaty was in poland 's interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski rained on sarkozy 's eu party kaczynski was quoted by the daily dziennik on tuesday as saying he would not endorse the treaty until ireland changed its stance and made the decision on its own , without giving in to pressure from other eu members . reform treaty a priority kaczynski 's move follows a statement by german president horst koehler on monday that he was suspending ratification of the treaty following a request to wait from germany 's constitutional court . german opponents of the reform treaty went to the court demanding injunctions against its ratification .
it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified . " there will be no enlargement of europe if we can not reform its institutions , " he said . attack on eu trade chief sparks anger the lisbon treaty was n't the only issue that threw a damper on what was billed as a proud day for france when it took over the helm of the eu from slovenia . sarkozy sparked outrage in the eu after he criticized eu trade chief peter mandelson in a french television interview on monday , suggesting mandelson was trying to force an unfavorable trade deal on europe . sarkozy spent his monday television appearance criticizing many aspects of the eu , such as the expertise of the european commission 's fisheries experts , the eu 's value-added tax rigour , the european central bank 's refusal to lower interest rates and mandelson 's policy on trade negotiations . " europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .

the treaty , intended to overhaul the bloc 's institutions , needs the backing of all 27 member states to come into force . kaczynski , a eurosceptic , helped negotiate the treaty but his party is now in opposition .
prime minister donald tusk said ratification of the lisbon treaty was in poland 's interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski rained on sarkozy 's eu party kaczynski was quoted by the daily dziennik on tuesday as saying he would not endorse the treaty until ireland changed its stance and made the decision on its own , without giving in to pressure from other eu members . reform treaty a priority kaczynski 's move follows a statement by german president horst koehler on monday that he was suspending ratification of the treaty following a request to wait from germany 's constitutional court . german opponents of the reform treaty went to the court demanding injunctions against its ratification .
it may take until next year for the constitutional court to give a verdict . with the czech republic also waiting on a court decision before ratifying , sarkozy will doubtless have to spend much of the next six months trying to save the treaty . sarkozy admitted as much on tuesday , saying that resolving the treaty crisis had become the top priority of the french eu presidency . sarkozy 's office in the elysee palace warned kaczynski that he risked preventing the eu from taking in new members , such as croatia or ukraine , which warsaw had supported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy more or less put his foot in his mouth during the interview in an interview on french television late monday , sarkozy had said the eu would take in no new members until the lisbon treaty is ratified . " there will be no enlargement of europe if we can not reform its institutions , " he said . attack on eu trade chief sparks anger the lisbon treaty was n't the only issue that threw a damper on what was billed as a proud day for france when it took over the helm of the eu from slovenia . sarkozy sparked outrage in the eu after he criticized eu trade chief peter mandelson in a french television interview on monday , suggesting mandelson was trying to force an unfavorable trade deal on europe . sarkozy spent his monday television appearance criticizing many aspects of the eu , such as the expertise of the european commission 's fisheries experts , the eu 's value-added tax rigour , the european central bank 's refusal to lower interest rates and mandelson 's policy on trade negotiations . " europe is worrying its citizens .
there have been mistakes in the way europe has been put together .
we have to change the way it is being put together , " sarkozy said . spat with trade commissioner sullies opening day sarkozy has long been critical of the british eu trade commissioner , accusing him of offering too generous concessions on farming in fraught negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson 's trade dealings were singled out by sarkozy " president sarkozy 's further attack on peter mandelson , as eu trade negotiator , as well as pascal lamy , is disappointing .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .
and when it comes to pay , working women on average earn a fourth less than their male colleagues .
germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .
" together with us they were the team in the last two , three years who were the most consistent , " he said .

" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .
" but we must be honest , that is not why we lost the game .
we did not do enough to win the european championship . "
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger said he felt the referee could have given germany a little bit more , but also said that the team could n't blame the loss on bad calls .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished , " he said .

" in my opinion the performance of the referee was very disappointing , " the former arsenal custodian said .
" he was a referee who did not really fancy us germans .
" i spoke to the referee and he was very arrogant .
in my opinion he was biased , " lehmann said .
" he clearly saw a head butt from a spanish player and he did not book him and he did not give him a red card and just before the end we had a good chance in the penalty area , but all of a sudden he gave a foul against us and even the spanish players were surprised with that free kick . "
lehmann , however , said that the spanish deserved to win .
" together with us they were the team in the last two , three years who were the most consistent , " he said .
goal should n't have happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann felt the referee was biased lehmann said that he was disappointed with the goal .
" as a player you always say ' if i had done this or done that ' .
i am not the kind of person who blames others .
if i had probably waited a bit longer or had done something different -lrb- fernando -rrb- torres would probably not have scored . "
he said that he did not know whether he would continue playing for germany .
" i have not made my mind up , i will do that in a little while and then i will let my coaches know and my teammates . "
punished for mistakes other german players agreed with lehmann 's assessment of the referee .
striker lukas podolski said that he did not think the referee had a good game .
" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .
" but we must be honest , that is not why we lost the game .
we did not do enough to win the european championship . "
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger said he felt the referee could have given germany a little bit more , but also said that the team could n't blame the loss on bad calls .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished , " he said .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .
although kacznski indicated he had no intention of signing the treaty , he left some wiggle room adding that it is " difficult to say how this whole thing will end .

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

the sum is 16 times what the british foreign office spent on its presidency in 2005 . the french government has not discussed what the money would be spent on , or whether competitive bids were issued for contracts granted by the office of president nicolas sarkozy , according to the french internet daily mediapart , which initially broke the story .
minister for foreign affairs jean-pierre jouyet said that the large sum was necessitated by expenditures linked to the union 's expansion to 27 members .
the budget " corresponds to that of a presidency for an enlarged europe , " jouyet said , adding that this made comparisons to the costs of previous eu presidencies meaningless .
too much money ?
one lawmaker from the opposition socialist party said that the large budget made little sense because france 's eu presidency , which starts tuesday , june 1 , takes place in the second half of the year and so is shorter because of the summer holidays .
among the many events scheduled for the french eu presidency , 22 involve the participation of one or more senior government members , 92 are international conferences where one government representative is present and 20 are informal ministerial conferences .
these events in themselves , which were proposed by france , not the eu , will cost 82 million euros , mediapart reported . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 01.07.2008 eu will offer out-of-court settlements to illegal cartels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to prevent monopolies in an effort to speed up cases against companies accused of price-fixing , the european union approved offering out-of-court settlements .
in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .
this has forced commission officials to focus on the court cases rather than on further investigations .
companies get a break the commission has therefore introduced a rule under which it can send companies it suspects of cartel involvement a summary of its suspicions and the evidence which it has for them .
companies which decide that the commission has enough evidence to find them guilty can reply by confessing and asking for a settlement - thereby speeding up the legal process .
if the commission agrees to a settlement , it can reduce the company 's fine by 10 percent .

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is making europe poorer , a leading european union official said this week . eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said it is important to begin talking about the impact high prices are having on europe 's economic wellbeing .
europe is sending revenue abroad to oil producers and exporters of raw materials such as grain and iron ore , almunia told the european parliament 's economy committee on monday , june 30 .
" as europe is dependent on energy from the outside world and as we also import a great number of commodities , this means the european economies are becoming poorer because of these price rises , " he said .
" this is a fact we are going to have to accept if we are to come up with responses . "
interest rate increase likely while almunia refused to put forward any specific suggestions , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to hike interest rates this week in an attempt to control inflation .
inflation across the 15 countries which use the euro as their currency was at a record high of 4 percent in june .
high inflation has been blamed largely on oil prices , which rose to over 91 euros -lrb- $ 143 -rrb- per barrel of crude on monday .
high inflation rates have led to protests by european truckers and fishermen .
almunia warned that any new measure to provide relief from high prices should not " create new distortions in the market . "
" we need to take care in avoiding creating an inflationary spiral and -lrb- focus -rrb- efforts here to protect the weakest parts of our population , " he said .
despite an economic slowdown , the ecb has signaled that it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on thursday in an attempt to cool inflation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker lukas podolski said that he did not think the referee had a good game .
" there were certain decisions where he went against us that could have gone in our favour , " he said .

ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty last month makes the ratification process a waste of time , he said . europe 's unity over the reform treaty continued to unravel this week after poland 's president seemed set to abandon his country 's approval of the eu 's reform treaty .
" at the moment the question of the treaty is pointless , " kazynski told the polish newspaper dziennik .
poland 's parliament approved the treaty in april , but kazynski 's signature is needed to finalize the ratification .
eu will survive the treaty faced its first stumbling bloc when it was rejected by irish voters in a referendum last month .
the treaty needs to be reatified by all 27 member states before becoming law .
kaczynski said he was unworried about the future of the eu .
even after a similar eu constitutional treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the union continued to function , kazynski told dziennik .
" the eu worked , is working and will continue to work , " kaczynski said in the interview published tuesday , july 1 .
more trouble ahead ?
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the bloc 's institutions and give it a stronger voice in international affairs .
treaty advocates worry that kaczynski 's refusal to sign the treaty could encourage the euroskeptical czech government to do the same later this year .
it could also put a freeze on the eu 's plans to accept new members , such as croatia .

in 2007 , the eu levied 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- in antitrust fines . companies caught operating illegal price-fixing cartels will get a chance to avoid lengthy court procedures and settle the cases , following a european commission decision on monday , june 30 .
the new method " will reinforce deterrence by helping the -lrb- european -rrb- commission deal more quickly with cartel cases , freeing up resources to open new investigations , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement .
the european commission is responsible for enforcing the bloc 's competition laws .
officials say that companies which the commission has found guilty of price-fixing often challenge the verdict in the european court - not to dispute their guilt , but to get the fine reduced .

german restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking by adolf hitler 's nazi regime .
the sensitivity of the issue has prompted authorities in most states to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
the toughest rules in germany are in bavaria , where no seperate smoking sections will be allowed .
lighting up however may still be allowed at the state 's famed munich beer festival in october .
the german constitutional court last month began hearing three legal challenges to the new laws , including one from barkeepers and nightclub owners who say it interferes with their right to practise their profession . the german cancer association , which claims 3,300 people die from passive smoking in germany annually , said tuesday the extension of the ban to all states meant " people can breathe a sigh of relief . " but the country 's biggest anti-tobacco lobby , pro rauchfrei , criticized that efforts to curb public smoking are in vain because of the absence of a single federal ban .
they argued that the number of exemptions allowed by the courts have created too much confusion . dutch ban allows pure marijuana the netherlands too implemented a smoking ban in cafes , bars and restaurants on tuesday .
but the legislation has led to a bizarre situation in the country 's famed coffee shops where smoking cannabis is permitted . the new legislation allows patrons of licensed cannabis cafes to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
possession of cannabis is illegal in the netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , that joint will have to be sans tobacco dutch authorities say they plan strict monitoring of the smoking ban and offenders can be fined up to 2,400 euros .
meanwhile , authorities in britain say a strict smoking ban introduced a year ago in all restaurants , bars and public places has prompted at least 400,000 people to kick the habit .
a study by britain 's cancer association and various pharmaceutical companies showed the smoking ban could prevent the death of 40,000 people in the coming ten years . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the main goal of the project is to develop and test ways of monitoring the stored co2 , " hilke wuerdemann from the national geo-science institute told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test period is scheduled to last for two years project directors have said the carbon sinking process is not a long-term solution to climate change but transitional technology , designed to cut the damages and buy time for researchers to come up with a more permanent solution to climate change and emissions . it is not yet clear how viable the method will be . eighteen partners from 9 european countries are involved in the project , which is jointly financed by the eu , the german government and private companies . cost a matter of perspective the inauguration of co2sink coincided with an international co2 conference in the hague on monday . peter boot , the international energy agency 's policy analysis director , said that global energy consumption was expected to rise 55 percent by 2030 , with carbon-emitting fossil fuels making of 84 percent of that . he strongly advocated implementing a separate , above-ground carbon capture and storage method -lrb- ccs -rrb- at power plants to contain emissions .
while the capture method occurs on-site at the point of carbon emission , underground storage is the next , complementary step in the process . the high cost of the technology has prevented the sector from putting it into operation thus far , though it is currently being tested at a vattenfall power plant in the eastern german city of cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction began on the project well over a year ago " this … is a litmus test whether governments are serious on climate policy or not , " said boot , " because this costs money . "
he added that the initial steps will have to be subsidized by governments . wuerdemann , on the other hand , said it was n't appropriate to quantify the project in monetary terms . " ' expensive , ' in my opinion , is n't a scientific term ; i would n't use the word , " she said .
" you could also say it 's cheap because it protects the climate . " harming the earth - or imitating it ? but price is n't the only worry that 's been raised .
environmental organizations have expressed concerns about the ecological soundness of the underground process .
in particular , greenpeace has said it poses a risk of highly toxic leaks into the soil . " no one knows exactly whether large amounts of co2 can securely remain underground for long periods of time , " said greenpeace climate expert gabriela von goerne . in response to the critique , wuerdemann pointed out that underground storage is an idea that stemmed from the earth itself . " we know that natural gas has been stored in the earth for millions of years , and we 're trying to imitate that , " she said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .

germany is certainly no role model in europe for gender equality - the country is ranked fourth from bottom on a recent eu equality survey .
it seems the working world is the last bastion for many men in germany to defend their privileges of power and influence , income and career .
men who take advantage of parental leave benefits for new fathers in germany to take care of their children will certainly attest to women 's plight in the working world because there 's hardly a boss who looks favorably upon it - the argument is that taking time off from work for childcare hurts the career just as it does with women .
it does n't help either that germany has a female chancellor who , like successive governments before her , has no political concept that could spark a social transformation and pave the way to real gender equality .
angela merkel lacks the courage of spanish prime minister zapatero who not only scored points during elections with a modern law on women 's equality but also appointed a woman as defense minister and made gender parity one of his priorities .
merkel also lacks the determination seen in the norwegian government that set up a women 's quota for listed companies and is thus gradually changing male hierarchies .
the majority of germany 's voters however seem to be ahead of their political leaders on the subject .
in a recent survey , some 80 percent said gender equality had had a positive impact on german society .
those who refuse to see it that way are usually those who fear they will have to share their patriarchal privileges in future .
in fact , they have nothing to lose - real equal participation in society would be a good investment in the future .

but dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says despite some successes , real gender equality still remains a dream . the political battle for gender equality is over 100 years old in germany .
its most famous activist was clara zetkin , the founder of the international women 's movement and international women 's day on march 8 .
zetkin 's main argument was that only equal economic opportunities would lead to women enjoying the same status as men .
half a century later , the enshrining of gender equality in the constitution of the young federal republic of germany was followed by the logical translation of the same into civil law .
for women , it was only a modest step .
after mastering a host of challenges and the difficult job of rebuilding a nation after two world wars , in the 1950s women were banished to the kitchen .
men were considered the natural heads of households and no married woman could take up work without the signature of her husband .
the romantic notion of the family from the 19th century - the man as the breadwinner of the family and the woman as the guardian of home and hearth - was meant to bring normality in a time which was anything but .
that , it appeared , fuelled increasingly entrenched gender roles and the division of labor in german society .
and the law enshrining gender equality which came into force on july 1 , 1958 did nothing to change that .
without doubt , these traditional gender roles have been steadily eroding since the 1970s .
on a rhetorical level , gender parity has long been achieved in germany .
at the same time , the once widely accepted gender stereotypes continue to pose the biggest hurdle in the working world .
overtime , flexible working hours and organizing daycare - all that does n't go together .
it 's the women once again who have to manage to balance work and children .
the fairer sex are seldom found in the corridors of power in the business world , their share of top-notch jobs remains abysmal and unchanged .
in fact , for years they 've been gradually withdrawing from professional life .

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
government welcomes ruling despite financial burden the ruling was welcomed by the german government , in spite of the fact that it posed a substantial additional burden on state the finances .
bildunterschrift : noting that the eu court had backed germany 's legal position , a spokesman for the finance ministry said the return of the funds to deutsche post would be carried out in the current budget .
tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .
the plaintiffs argued that deutsche post was covering the loss generated by its door-to-door parcels service with the state support it was given for delivering letters , and was therefore effectively benefiting from unfair state aid .
commission ruled post had broken competition rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ruled that deutsche post had broken the law in 2001 , the commission ruled that deutsche post had indeed broken eu competition rules , and ordered it to pay the german government 572 million euros , which the commission calculated it had received in aid .
tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .
the commission said it would study the verdict " carefully " before deciding whether to file an appeal to the european court of justice .

"
the case concerns deutsche post 's door-to-door parcel delivery service , which it operates in competition with commercial firms .
and tuesday 's ruling was expected to have implications on a separate eu probe , launched by the commission in september , over claims that germany had supplied deutsche post with illegal state aid for carrying out its universal service obligations .
" we will take due account of the court 's ruling and apply any lessons to be learned from it to ongoing cases , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
government welcomes ruling despite financial burden the ruling was welcomed by the german government , in spite of the fact that it posed a substantial additional burden on state the finances .
bildunterschrift : noting that the eu court had backed germany 's legal position , a spokesman for the finance ministry said the return of the funds to deutsche post would be carried out in the current budget .
tuesday 's ruling refers to a case first brought to the attention of the eu in 1994 , when a number of competitors complained that deutsche post was offering the service at below cost price .
the plaintiffs argued that deutsche post was covering the loss generated by its door-to-door parcels service with the state support it was given for delivering letters , and was therefore effectively benefiting from unfair state aid .
commission ruled post had broken competition rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ruled that deutsche post had broken the law in 2001 , the commission ruled that deutsche post had indeed broken eu competition rules , and ordered it to pay the german government 572 million euros , which the commission calculated it had received in aid .
tuesday 's judgement overturns that decision and means that deutsche post is now free to claim the 572 million euros plus interest , bringing the total to close to 1 billion euros , back from the government .
the commission said it would study the verdict " carefully " before deciding whether to file an appeal to the european court of justice .

the kidnappers took the couple ashore before abandoning the yacht and disappearing into a nearby mountainous area in the semi-autonomous puntland region . an intermediary in the negotiations for the hostages ' release told deutsche presse-agentur that the couple are in good health and being treated well , although the man suffers from diabetes and has not had access to insulin for several days . the situation is quite different for the crew of the german-flagged cargo ship the mv lehmann timber .
at least four members of that crew are said to be ill and in urgent need of medical treatment after being kidnapped in nearby waters .
talks for their release are in deadlock . another cargo ship captured at the same time as the mv lehmann timber was released after the pirates received a ransom of one million dollars . rampant piracy on the somalian seas piracy is rife off the coast of the relatively lawless horn of africa nation .
cargo ships and luxury yachts have been targeted by heavily-armed pirates , who then hold the crew ransom . the most high-profile case in recent months involved the capture of a luxury french yacht in april .
french troops rescued the hostages and captured six of the pirates , although another six are believed to have escaped . the united nations security council recently approved incursions into somali waters to curb piracy , which the weak transitional government , currently engaged in countering a bloody insurgency , is powerless to prevent . somalia , whose coast commands access to the red sea , has been in a state of anarchy since the overthrow of dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew will remain in charge and will lead his team into the coming qualification rounds . " it is clear that we will bring in new players , but there will be no full overhaul , " loew said in an interview with tuesday 's edition of the bild daily .
loew said that captain michael ballack and torsten frings , both 31 , " are still hungry for success " and that " bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm and lukas podolski are yet to peak . "
he also said that 38-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann has so far not announced his retirement .
the core of loew 's team has been together since the 2006 world cup where germany finished third .
the team then came second at euro , losing sunday 's final 1-0 against spain .
qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa starts in september , with the euro semi-finalist russia germany 's toughest opponent in the group .
but loew confidently predicted that germany would qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
possible additions include youngster marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes who were all dropped just ahead of euro .
loew said " we can be proud " that germany was the only nation to make the semi-finals at the 2006 world cup and then at euro as well .
" we reached the final in a tournament played on the highest level , " he said .
" that is a big success .
we have become stable in the past two years .
but there is a lot to be improved . "
loew praises winners , admits mistakes bildunterschrift : despite bitter defeat in the final , loew and his team were greeted as heroes in berlin but loew said that germany stood no real chance after a strong start once spain got rolling on sunday .
he praised a spanish team of world class players and said that " spain celebrated its game . "
asked whether he regretted any decisions he made at the tournament , loew named the semi-final which germany won 3-2 in the last minute over turkey after being outplayed for most of the match .
" i believe we should have better played with a 4-4-2 than with five men in midfield , " he said .
" we could have generated more pressure and would n't have had to suffer for so long .
but we got into the final , that 's why nothing was wrong . "
loew predicted that the next time his team meets the newly-crowned european champions , his team would win .
" the spanish were a very good team all through the championship , " loew said .
" we have to recognize their quality ...
should the spanish come up again in a championship we will beat them .
we were crazy with disappointment and sadness , but i think that coming second was a great achievement for us .
the team has performed amazingly in the last two years and we can all be proud that we were in the final . "
serial disappointment does n't dull ballack 's hunger captain michael ballack said meanwhile it was " always bitter " to lose a final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack praised the fans for their support at euro 2008 " of course we are disappointed after coming so far , after so many weeks of hard work , and the qualification too , " ballack said .
" and then to get to the final and to lose , that is always bitter to lose a final , for sure . "
losing in a final is a feeling the chelsea midfielder is intimately acquainted with , having lost may 's champions league final to manchester united and february 's league cup decider to tottenham hotspur .
and nor it is the first time that defeat for the 31-year-old has been at the hands of the spanish , having lost to real madrid in the 2002 champions league final when he played for bayer leverkusen .
for the 2002 world cup final defeat to brazil he was suspended .
he also said that germany 's strong performance in euro 2008 - notably their emphatic 3-2 quarter-final victory over portugal - was in large part down to the huge numbers of fans that traveled to austria and switzerland to cheer them on .
" for practically every game -lrb- our -rrb- supporters were always in the majority , " he said .
" and that is important for our team .
it is still a young team and it is very , very important that particularly in difficult phases of the game to have the support , and in many , many games that was fantastic .

media requires javascript to play .
the raf typhoon takes to the skies with a deafening roar , a typhoon powers through the haze on the runway and into the desert sky .
after a long wait , these planes are now ready to form the backbone of the raf 's war-fighting capability for decades to come .
the typhoon , along with half a dozen others , was cruising over villages populated by afghans thousands of feet below , watching over a brigade of soldiers from the us army .
the raf typhoons , as well as us fighter jets and layers of other reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft , took off in a near constant stream to provide air cover for the troops .
but this is not yet afghanistan - it 's the nevada desert and an exercise called green flag west .
the strange sights of the las vegas skyline lie in the distance with mock pyramids and eiffel towers providing the backdrop for the runway at nellis air force base .
this exercise was the final chance for the typhoon to go through its paces before it was declared ready for combat .
and the verdict from all quarters - including the us air force pilots who flew alongside it - was that the typhoon was more than ready .
you can turn on a sixpence wing commander gav parker eurofighter ' fully combat ready ' such is the effort to make the exercise seem realistic that hollywood set designers have been brought in to make the villages look real from the ground as well as the air and local afghans living in the us -lrb- and sometimes iraqis depending on the exercise -rrb- are asked to live in the mock-up villages for days on end .
different scenarios are run through , to test both the us army on the ground as well as the air cover provided by the us air force and the raf .
a key part of the mission is to train both army forward air controllers -lrb- fac -rrb- and the pilots they talk to in how to work together successfully .
in a part of the exercise replayed to us , you could hear a fac hesitantly trying to direct the planes to spot someone moving out of a building .
in a battle-field context , ensuring that the information is accurate is vital in making sure either aerial surveillance capability or the deployment of weapons is employed accurately and does not endanger civilians .
pilots have hailed the new typhoon as a success " the aim is to train for the current flight , " explains lt col ron hanselman who runs the exercise about 10 times a year for those soon to head off to the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan .
the arrival of the typhoon - or the eurofighter to give the aircraft its generic name - has not been without controversy .
it was originally conceived in the cold war designed for aerial combat with soviet aircraft .
its delivery has been beset by cost over-runs and delays and questions over how well it could adapt to the new 21st century era of warfare with a priority of supporting troops on the ground rather than engaging in dogfights in the air .
the raf has driven forward towards developing air-to-ground sensor and weapons capability and getting the typhoon ready for operations with 1 july 2008 as a deadline .
seven typhoons in all were brought over from the uk for the exercise which provided a chance to fly on training ranges far bigger than are available in the uk and also interact with us counter-parts with extensive debriefing after every mission .
there 's no doubt about the affection the pilots and engineering support staff have for the typhoon .
" you can turn on a sixpence , " said wing commander gav parker who is charge of 11 sqn as he showed me round one of the typhoons .
' new generation ' the latest technology in the typhoons means that data can be downloaded from the plane 's sensors to a laptop style devices held by those on the ground .
this can help guide a pilot onto a target by allowing them to see exactly what is coming through the typhoon 's sensor pod .
the typhoon is a state of the art fighter aircraft " it 's a new generation of aircraft , " group captain stuart atha , in charge of the raf 's typhoons explained .
" it is fast , it can carry lots of weapons .
it has new sensors .
it has got data links .
it has got radar .
so the pilot knows a lot more of what 's going on around him . "
during their time in the us , the typhoons managed to fly 99.3 % of the sorties that were planned and a total of 67 weapons were dropped onto a range with a 100 % falling into the expected area .
the exercise was used to prove that the typhoon is not just useful for air-to-air combat but has also been successfully adapted for air-to-ground and the modern battlefield .
until now , the typhoon 's deployments have been limited .
ironically , it has been busiest performing a throw-back to the cold war by intercepting russian aircraft heading towards uk airspace .
but with green flag now complete and judged a success , the typhoon has been declared ready for deployable combat operations .
officials stress that this does not mean that the typhoon will be rushed into missions over afghanistan or iraq immediately - but that day is now closer .

the raf typhoon takes to the skies with a deafening roar , a typhoon powers through the haze on the runway and into the desert sky .
after a long wait , these planes are now ready to form the backbone of the raf 's war-fighting capability for decades to come .
the typhoon , along with half a dozen others , was cruising over villages populated by afghans thousands of feet below , watching over a brigade of soldiers from the us army .
the raf typhoons , as well as us fighter jets and layers of other reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft , took off in a near constant stream to provide air cover for the troops .
but this is not yet afghanistan - it 's the nevada desert and an exercise called green flag west .
the strange sights of the las vegas skyline lie in the distance with mock pyramids and eiffel towers providing the backdrop for the runway at nellis air force base .
this exercise was the final chance for the typhoon to go through its paces before it was declared ready for combat .
and the verdict from all quarters - including the us air force pilots who flew alongside it - was that the typhoon was more than ready .
you can turn on a sixpence wing commander gav parker eurofighter ' fully combat ready ' such is the effort to make the exercise seem realistic that hollywood set designers have been brought in to make the villages look real from the ground as well as the air and local afghans living in the us -lrb- and sometimes iraqis depending on the exercise -rrb- are asked to live in the mock-up villages for days on end .
different scenarios are run through , to test both the us army on the ground as well as the air cover provided by the us air force and the raf .
a key part of the mission is to train both army forward air controllers -lrb- fac -rrb- and the pilots they talk to in how to work together successfully .
in a part of the exercise replayed to us , you could hear a fac hesitantly trying to direct the planes to spot someone moving out of a building .
in a battle-field context , ensuring that the information is accurate is vital in making sure either aerial surveillance capability or the deployment of weapons is employed accurately and does not endanger civilians .
pilots have hailed the new typhoon as a success " the aim is to train for the current flight , " explains lt col ron hanselman who runs the exercise about 10 times a year for those soon to head off to the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan .
the arrival of the typhoon - or the eurofighter to give the aircraft its generic name - has not been without controversy .
it was originally conceived in the cold war designed for aerial combat with soviet aircraft .
its delivery has been beset by cost over-runs and delays and questions over how well it could adapt to the new 21st century era of warfare with a priority of supporting troops on the ground rather than engaging in dogfights in the air .
the raf has driven forward towards developing air-to-ground sensor and weapons capability and getting the typhoon ready for operations with 1 july 2008 as a deadline .
seven typhoons in all were brought over from the uk for the exercise which provided a chance to fly on training ranges far bigger than are available in the uk and also interact with us counter-parts with extensive debriefing after every mission .
there 's no doubt about the affection the pilots and engineering support staff have for the typhoon .
" you can turn on a sixpence , " said wing commander gav parker who is charge of 11 sqn as he showed me round one of the typhoons .
' new generation ' the latest technology in the typhoons means that data can be downloaded from the plane 's sensors to a laptop style devices held by those on the ground .
this can help guide a pilot onto a target by allowing them to see exactly what is coming through the typhoon 's sensor pod .
the typhoon is a state of the art fighter aircraft " it 's a new generation of aircraft , " group captain stuart atha , in charge of the raf 's typhoons explained .
" it is fast , it can carry lots of weapons .
it has new sensors .
it has got data links .
it has got radar .
so the pilot knows a lot more of what 's going on around him . "
during their time in the us , the typhoons managed to fly 99.3 % of the sorties that were planned and a total of 67 weapons were dropped onto a range with a 100 % falling into the expected area .
the exercise was used to prove that the typhoon is not just useful for air-to-air combat but has also been successfully adapted for air-to-ground and the modern battlefield .
until now , the typhoon 's deployments have been limited .
ironically , it has been busiest performing a throw-back to the cold war by intercepting russian aircraft heading towards uk airspace .
but with green flag now complete and judged a success , the typhoon has been declared ready for deployable combat operations .
officials stress that this does not mean that the typhoon will be rushed into missions over afghanistan or iraq immediately - but that day is now closer .

the raf typhoon takes to the skies with a deafening roar , a typhoon powers through the haze on the runway and into the desert sky .
after a long wait , these planes are now ready to form the backbone of the raf 's war-fighting capability for decades to come .
the typhoon , along with half a dozen others , was cruising over villages populated by afghans thousands of feet below , watching over a brigade of soldiers from the us army .
the raf typhoons , as well as us fighter jets and layers of other reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft , took off in a near constant stream to provide air cover for the troops .
but this is not yet afghanistan - it 's the nevada desert and an exercise called green flag west .
the strange sights of the las vegas skyline lie in the distance with mock pyramids and eiffel towers providing the backdrop for the runway at nellis air force base .
this exercise was the final chance for the typhoon to go through its paces before it was declared ready for combat .
and the verdict from all quarters - including the us air force pilots who flew alongside it - was that the typhoon was more than ready .
you can turn on a sixpence wing commander gav parker eurofighter ' fully combat ready ' such is the effort to make the exercise seem realistic that hollywood set designers have been brought in to make the villages look real from the ground as well as the air and local afghans living in the us -lrb- and sometimes iraqis depending on the exercise -rrb- are asked to live in the mock-up villages for days on end .
different scenarios are run through , to test both the us army on the ground as well as the air cover provided by the us air force and the raf .
a key part of the mission is to train both army forward air controllers -lrb- fac -rrb- and the pilots they talk to in how to work together successfully .
in a part of the exercise replayed to us , you could hear a fac hesitantly trying to direct the planes to spot someone moving out of a building .
in a battle-field context , ensuring that the information is accurate is vital in making sure either aerial surveillance capability or the deployment of weapons is employed accurately and does not endanger civilians .
pilots have hailed the new typhoon as a success " the aim is to train for the current flight , " explains lt col ron hanselman who runs the exercise about 10 times a year for those soon to head off to the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan .
the arrival of the typhoon - or the eurofighter to give the aircraft its generic name - has not been without controversy .
it was originally conceived in the cold war designed for aerial combat with soviet aircraft .
its delivery has been beset by cost over-runs and delays and questions over how well it could adapt to the new 21st century era of warfare with a priority of supporting troops on the ground rather than engaging in dogfights in the air .
the raf has driven forward towards developing air-to-ground sensor and weapons capability and getting the typhoon ready for operations with 1 july 2008 as a deadline .
seven typhoons in all were brought over from the uk for the exercise which provided a chance to fly on training ranges far bigger than are available in the uk and also interact with us counter-parts with extensive debriefing after every mission .
there 's no doubt about the affection the pilots and engineering support staff have for the typhoon .
" you can turn on a sixpence , " said wing commander gav parker who is charge of 11 sqn as he showed me round one of the typhoons .
' new generation ' the latest technology in the typhoons means that data can be downloaded from the plane 's sensors to a laptop style devices held by those on the ground .
this can help guide a pilot onto a target by allowing them to see exactly what is coming through the typhoon 's sensor pod .
the typhoon is a state of the art fighter aircraft " it 's a new generation of aircraft , " group captain stuart atha , in charge of the raf 's typhoons explained .
" it is fast , it can carry lots of weapons .
it has new sensors .
it has got data links .
it has got radar .
so the pilot knows a lot more of what 's going on around him . "
during their time in the us , the typhoons managed to fly 99.3 % of the sorties that were planned and a total of 67 weapons were dropped onto a range with a 100 % falling into the expected area .
the exercise was used to prove that the typhoon is not just useful for air-to-air combat but has also been successfully adapted for air-to-ground and the modern battlefield .
until now , the typhoon 's deployments have been limited .
ironically , it has been busiest performing a throw-back to the cold war by intercepting russian aircraft heading towards uk airspace .
but with green flag now complete and judged a success , the typhoon has been declared ready for deployable combat operations .
officials stress that this does not mean that the typhoon will be rushed into missions over afghanistan or iraq immediately - but that day is now closer .

after a long wait , these planes are now ready to form the backbone of the raf 's war-fighting capability for decades to come .
the typhoon , along with half a dozen others , was cruising over villages populated by afghans thousands of feet below , watching over a brigade of soldiers from the us army .
the raf typhoons , as well as us fighter jets and layers of other reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft , took off in a near constant stream to provide air cover for the troops .
but this is not yet afghanistan - it 's the nevada desert and an exercise called green flag west .
the strange sights of the las vegas skyline lie in the distance with mock pyramids and eiffel towers providing the backdrop for the runway at nellis air force base .
this exercise was the final chance for the typhoon to go through its paces before it was declared ready for combat .
and the verdict from all quarters - including the us air force pilots who flew alongside it - was that the typhoon was more than ready .
you can turn on a sixpence wing commander gav parker eurofighter ' fully combat ready ' such is the effort to make the exercise seem realistic that hollywood set designers have been brought in to make the villages look real from the ground as well as the air and local afghans living in the us -lrb- and sometimes iraqis depending on the exercise -rrb- are asked to live in the mock-up villages for days on end .
different scenarios are run through , to test both the us army on the ground as well as the air cover provided by the us air force and the raf .
a key part of the mission is to train both army forward air controllers -lrb- fac -rrb- and the pilots they talk to in how to work together successfully .
in a part of the exercise replayed to us , you could hear a fac hesitantly trying to direct the planes to spot someone moving out of a building .
in a battle-field context , ensuring that the information is accurate is vital in making sure either aerial surveillance capability or the deployment of weapons is employed accurately and does not endanger civilians .
pilots have hailed the new typhoon as a success " the aim is to train for the current flight , " explains lt col ron hanselman who runs the exercise about 10 times a year for those soon to head off to the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan .
the arrival of the typhoon - or the eurofighter to give the aircraft its generic name - has not been without controversy .
it was originally conceived in the cold war designed for aerial combat with soviet aircraft .
its delivery has been beset by cost over-runs and delays and questions over how well it could adapt to the new 21st century era of warfare with a priority of supporting troops on the ground rather than engaging in dogfights in the air .
the raf has driven forward towards developing air-to-ground sensor and weapons capability and getting the typhoon ready for operations with 1 july 2008 as a deadline .
seven typhoons in all were brought over from the uk for the exercise which provided a chance to fly on training ranges far bigger than are available in the uk and also interact with us counter-parts with extensive debriefing after every mission .
there 's no doubt about the affection the pilots and engineering support staff have for the typhoon .
" you can turn on a sixpence , " said wing commander gav parker who is charge of 11 sqn as he showed me round one of the typhoons .
' new generation ' the latest technology in the typhoons means that data can be downloaded from the plane 's sensors to a laptop style devices held by those on the ground .
this can help guide a pilot onto a target by allowing them to see exactly what is coming through the typhoon 's sensor pod .
the typhoon is a state of the art fighter aircraft " it 's a new generation of aircraft , " group captain stuart atha , in charge of the raf 's typhoons explained .
" it is fast , it can carry lots of weapons .
it has new sensors .
it has got data links .
it has got radar .
so the pilot knows a lot more of what 's going on around him . "
during their time in the us , the typhoons managed to fly 99.3 % of the sorties that were planned and a total of 67 weapons were dropped onto a range with a 100 % falling into the expected area .
the exercise was used to prove that the typhoon is not just useful for air-to-air combat but has also been successfully adapted for air-to-ground and the modern battlefield .
until now , the typhoon 's deployments have been limited .
ironically , it has been busiest performing a throw-back to the cold war by intercepting russian aircraft heading towards uk airspace .
but with green flag now complete and judged a success , the typhoon has been declared ready for deployable combat operations .
officials stress that this does not mean that the typhoon will be rushed into missions over afghanistan or iraq immediately - but that day is now closer .

local am lesley griffiths has asked skills minister john griffiths why yale college " has received such a poor financial settlement " .
she said the college 's grant funding had been frozen at £ 17.238m , forcing it to offer redundancy to 23 managers .
the welsh assembly government said funding was influenced by many factors .
ms griffiths said she knew of at least two colleges in wales where funding had increased this year by £ 1m , while yale 's had not risen .
funding for further education in wales is distributed in the fairest way to ensure they can deliver the best possible education standards welsh assembly government she said she had met trade union representatives to hear their concerns about yale 's financial position .
in a letter to mr griffiths she wrote : " my constituents want to know why yale college has received such a poor settlement in comparison to other fe colleges and sixth form facilities attached to high schools .
" i am very concerned about the 23 voluntary redundancies recently announced by yale college in light of this funding settlement and am particularly concerned that students are going to be affected with proposals to stop certain courses altogether , reduce teaching hours and not replace staff vacancies . "
a college spokeswoman confirmed yale was looking to cut some positions and had offered voluntary redundancy to 23 managers .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said : " funding for further education -lrb- fe -rrb- in wales is distributed in the fairest way to ensure they can deliver the best possible education standards .
" there are a variety of factors which influence the level of funding given to an fe institution .
" for example , funding is distributed on the basis of the volume of learning provided by an fe institution as well as the numbers of students attending from deprived areas . "
he added : " all of this is part of a movement from an old method of funding fe institutions to a new more effective method .
institutions have been aware of the changes planned since 2004 . "

advertisement hazel halter was a figure of authority on the wards there 's something about matron .
perhaps it is the iconic image of hattie jacques from the " carry on " films .
something powerful , domineering and above all large .
as hospital infections have spiralled in the nhs the call has gone out : " bring back matron " .
so that is we what did .
at 83 hazel halter has lost none of her authority .
we went to addenbrookes hospital in cambridge where hazel was matron in the 1970 's .
although she does n't have the physical presence of hattie jacques she admits she can still strike the fear of god into hospital staff .
" i think you had to be a bit scary , " she said .
" i think it is like when you 're at home you have to be a little bit frightened of your parents .
" i think they looked up to you in those days as a figure of authority - but i think they also saw you as a sort of mother figure of the hospital . "
critical eye matron has come back to cast a critical eye over the nhs .
in our day we had a block of carbolic soap and a scrubbing brush .
we scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed our nails and our hands until they were almost raw hazel halter she will see whether the much vaunted fight back against the super bugs adds up to much .
first stop : the sink .
" why are you using that particular soap ? "
matron asks an unsuspecting nurse .
" it 's the one recommended by the trust for infection control , " comes the answer .
" and the other one ? "
" that 's for general hand washing . "
hazel found the modern nhs was very different all very different from matron 's time .
" in our day we had a block of carbolic soap and a scrubbing brush .
we scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed our nails and our hands until they were almost raw . "
today in hospitals there 's a combination of soap and alcohol gel .
" i thought it was confusing " says hazel .
" i saw several people walk by and not use it .
" i saw other people using it quite a lot and i do n't think people understand when they 're supposed to use it and when they 're not supposed to use it . "
disapproving of uniforms it 's not the only thing matron is n't sure about .
she thinks visiting hours are too long and she is unhappy about uniforms .
i do n't think you can bring back matron in the way it was in my day hazel halter nurses used to have starched collars , aprons and hair pinned up .
" i do n't like the modern uniforms they all seem very tight . "
but that is not hazel 's main concern .
" they told me that they took them home to wash , " she said .
" i 'm not happy about that .
some will be very conscientious , others wo n't be bothering . "
when hazel first trained in 1946 nurses did most of the cleaning .
cleaning rot hospital infections were rare and , of course , mrsa was not a problem - the staphylococcus aureus bug had not developed a resistance to antibiotics by then .
today most cleaning in hospitals is contracted out to private companies .
hazel does not blame individual cleaners , but says when nurses stopped cleaning the rot set in .
" they 'd got very slack and i think it 's a reflection of society as a whole that people do n't pay the same sort of attention to things today like hygiene . "
at addenbrookes - and across the nhs - rates of mrsa and clostridium difficile have started to fall .
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
the government has made hygiene a priority .
there have been a number of high profile initiatives like deep cleans and the screening of patients .
dr nick brown , consultant medical microbiologist at addenbrookes , says the culture has changed .
" in the not too distant past there was an acceptance that infections were inevitable and there was n't much that we could do about them .
" i think that attitude has changed and the results recently have shown that that is the case . "
the old-style matron often inspired fear in the nhs in england today there are 5,000 so-called modern matrons .
they are responsible for a smaller number of wards than the old style matron but they still have control over all nursing and cleaning staff on those wards .
so should we bring back the old style matron ?
would it make any difference ?
hazel is n't sure .
" i do n't think you can bring back matron in the way it was in my day .
" but i think personally seeing those girls this morning i thought they were doing a very good job . "
the reality is hospitals today are probably too big for one person to look after .
the days of matron have gone .

perhaps it is the iconic image of hattie jacques from the " carry on " films .
something powerful , domineering and above all large .
as hospital infections have spiralled in the nhs the call has gone out : " bring back matron " .
so that is we what did .
at 83 hazel halter has lost none of her authority .
we went to addenbrookes hospital in cambridge where hazel was matron in the 1970 's .
although she does n't have the physical presence of hattie jacques she admits she can still strike the fear of god into hospital staff .
" i think you had to be a bit scary , " she said .
" i think it is like when you 're at home you have to be a little bit frightened of your parents .
" i think they looked up to you in those days as a figure of authority - but i think they also saw you as a sort of mother figure of the hospital . "
critical eye matron has come back to cast a critical eye over the nhs . "
in our day we had a block of carbolic soap and a scrubbing brush .
we scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed our nails and our hands until they were almost raw " hazel halter she will see whether the much vaunted fight back against the super bugs adds up to much .
first stop : the sink .
" why are you using that particular soap ? "
matron asks an unsuspecting nurse .
" it 's the one recommended by the trust for infection control , " comes the answer .
" and the other one ? "
" that 's for general hand washing . "
all very different from matron 's time .
" in our day we had a block of carbolic soap and a scrubbing brush .
we scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed our nails and our hands until they were almost raw . "
today in hospitals there 's a combination of soap and alcohol gel .
" i thought it was confusing " says hazel .
" i saw several people walk by and not use it .
" i saw other people using it quite a lot and i do n't think people understand when they 're supposed to use it and when they 're not supposed to use it . "
disapproving of uniforms it 's not the only thing matron is n't sure about .
she thinks visiting hours are too long and she is unhappy about uniforms . "
i do n't think you can bring back matron in the way it was in my day " hazel halter nurses used to have starched collars , aprons and hair pinned up .
" i do n't like the modern uniforms they all seem very tight . "
but that is not hazel 's main concern .
" they told me that they took them home to wash , " she said .
" i 'm not happy about that .
some will be very conscientious , others wo n't be bothering . "
when hazel first trained in 1946 nurses did most of the cleaning .
cleaning rot hospital infections were rare and , of course , mrsa was not a problem - the staphylococcus aureus bug had not developed a resistance to antibiotics by then .
today most cleaning in hospitals is contracted out to private companies .
hazel does not blame individual cleaners , but says when nurses stopped cleaning the rot set in .
" they 'd got very slack and i think it 's a reflection of society as a whole that people do n't pay the same sort of attention to things today like hygiene . "
at addenbrookes - and across the nhs - rates of mrsa and clostridium difficile have started to fall .
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
the government has made hygiene a priority .
there have been a number of high profile initiatives like deep cleans and the screening of patients .
dr nick brown , consultant medical microbiologist at addenbrookes , says the culture has changed .
" in the not too distant past there was an acceptance that infections were inevitable and there was n't much that we could do about them .
" i think that attitude has changed and the results recently have shown that that is the case . "
in the nhs in england today there are 5,000 so-called modern matrons .
they are responsible for a smaller number of wards than the old style matron but they still have control over all nursing and cleaning staff on those wards .
so should we bring back the old style matron ?
would it make any difference ?
hazel is n't sure .
" i do n't think you can bring back matron in the way it was in my day .
" but i think personally seeing those girls this morning i thought they were doing a very good job . "
the reality is hospitals today are probably too big for one person to look after .
the days of matron have gone .

the 2.5 % deal would mean rises of as little as 15p per hour in the first year , according to public sector union unison .
the other unions representing council staff , gmb and unite , also rejected the offer and will ballot their members in july .
councils have warned they have to operate within limited resources .
the unison ballot will include members working for scotland 's 32 local councils , local joint valuation boards and fire and rescue staff .
unison regional organiser dougie black said council umbrella organisation cosla had failed to address concerns over the rejection of their " inadequate " offer and it was now clear that members had to deliver a " yes " vote .
he added : " they have failed to tackle the issue that the offer increases the gap between the higher and lower paid .
" at the bottom end the offer means a mere 15p per hour increase in the first year . "
local government unions want an increase of 5 % , or £ 1,000 , but councils have offered an increase of 2.5 % a year for the next three years .
unison members in england , wales and northern ireland earlier voted to take strike action over a 2.45 % offer .

there have been no face-to-face talks yet - the delegations sit in separate hotels while turkish mediators shuttle back and forth with messages .
syria and israel said in may they had resumed talks after an eight-year gap .
on monday , the israeli parliament gave initial approval to a bill that could make it more difficult to make any withdrawal from the key golan heights .
the bill would require a referendum or the support of two-thirds of mps before a withdrawal from the territory , occupied by israel since 1967 .
the draft bill still needs to be approved at a second and third reading before it becomes law .
israeli army radio and public radio both said envoys shalom turjeman and yoram turbowitz were headed to turkey .
it is not known who is representing the syrians in the talks .

hmv said pre-tax profits had risen by 25.5 % to £ 56.6m in the year to 26 april , not including income from its japan business which it sold last year .
like-for-like sales grew 7.3 % across the group , rising 11.4 % at hmv uk & ireland .
its bookselling business waterstone 's saw sales rise by 3.3 % .
efforts to revitalise hmv were paying off , the company said .
' stronger ' business in 2007 , hmv began a three-year programme to turn around the business , after being hit by falling profits .
the firm - which operates 379 hmv stores worldwide and 313 waterstone 's outlets - has come up against strong competition from supermarkets and music downloads .
chief executive simon fox said that one year into transformation plans , the firm was " ahead of where we expected to be " .
" we still have much to do , and whilst we are mindful of the challenging economic outlook , the current financial year has started in line with our expectations and i remain confident that we are building a better and stronger business that can prosper in a rapidly-changing market , " he said .
hmv also announced that following last july 's sale of its japanese business , it had ended the year " broadly debt-free " .
tough competition the firm said it had clearly benefited from a strong games market - with this making up 21 % of uk and ireland sales , up from 14 % the previous year .
nintendo ds game more brain training topped its bestsellers chart , which also featured fifa 08 for the playstation 2 and the nintendo wii 's mario & sonic at the olympic games .
hmv said it was to roll out more " next generation " stores , featuring a " social hub " , entertainment websites and games zone .
it is also to start selling second-hand video games - which customers have traded in part-exchange for newer products .
" we continued to enhance our credibility with customers and suppliers in the fast-growing games console and software market , " it said .
though the firm 's shares had been on a " rollercoaster ride " , the market recognised " a small glimmer of hope " said richard hunter of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
" the figures are , in themselves , decent enough but the company remains embattled in its field .
" digital downloads are firmly taking hold and , in any event , the presence of online retailers and the supermarkets is exerting severe pressure on their business model . "

hmv said pre-tax profits had risen by 25.5 % to £ 56.6m in the year to 26 april , not including income from its japan business which it sold last year .
like-for-like sales grew 7.3 % across the group , rising 11.4 % at hmv uk & ireland .
its bookselling business waterstone 's saw sales rise by 3.3 % .
efforts to revitalise hmv were paying off , the company said .
' stronger ' business in 2007 , hmv began a three-year programme to turn around the business , after being hit by falling profits .
the firm - which operates 379 hmv stores worldwide and 313 waterstone 's outlets - has come up against strong competition from supermarkets and music downloads .
chief executive simon fox said that one year into transformation plans , the firm was " ahead of where we expected to be " .
" we still have much to do , and whilst we are mindful of the challenging economic outlook , the current financial year has started in line with our expectations and i remain confident that we are building a better and stronger business that can prosper in a rapidly-changing market , " he said .
hmv also announced that following last july 's sale of its japanese business , it had ended the year " broadly debt-free " .
tough competition the firm said it had clearly benefited from a strong games market - with this making up 21 % of uk and ireland sales , up from 14 % the previous year .
nintendo ds game more brain training topped its bestsellers chart , which also featured fifa 08 for the playstation 2 and the nintendo wii 's mario & sonic at the olympic games .
hmv said it was to roll out more " next generation " stores , featuring a " social hub " , entertainment websites and games zone .
it is also to start selling second-hand video games - which customers have traded in part-exchange for newer products .
" we continued to enhance our credibility with customers and suppliers in the fast-growing games console and software market , " it said .
though the firm 's shares had been on a " rollercoaster ride " , the market recognised " a small glimmer of hope " said richard hunter of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
" the figures are , in themselves , decent enough but the company remains embattled in its field .
" digital downloads are firmly taking hold and , in any event , the presence of online retailers and the supermarkets is exerting severe pressure on their business model . "

it wants to kick-start a revolution in space by letting eu politicians not bureaucrats decide on priorities for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
the french say that if europe fails to change its approach to space , it will fall behind japan , china and india .
paris is seeking an alliance with the uk to drive the agenda forward during the french presidency of the eu .
' political pilot ' president nicolas sarkozy 's well-known admiration for all things american now extends to space exploration .
speaking to the bbc , a senior official involved in french space policy said that it was time to shake up the european space agency and make it more like the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- by giving it a new , politically-led direction .
the french take over the rotating presidency of the european union on 1 july and are planning to make space policy a key area for reform .
the official said that europe was in danger of becoming redundant in global space terms and it needed an agency that followed a clear political agenda .
" the united states , russia , china and japan would not do what they do in space without a political motivation ; europe has only had a scientific motivation until now .
so what we are saying is , let 's get the same chances as the others .
" beside the scientific pilot , let us have a political pilot , too , which will be the eu , because there is only the eu that can speak at that level . "
but alan cooper , european space policy implementation manager with esa in paris , says that comparisons with nasa are unfair .
" nasa has the reputation it has on the strength of the programmes it has delivered , " he told bbc news .
" it spends seven or eight times as much as esa spends in a year .
its profile you would expect then to be seven or eight times higher than esa .
if you want the european space programme to have the same impact , it will need a higher profile and the investment to match those goals . "
record of success the european space agency was formed in 1975 , and its seventeen member-states include countries outside the eu - switzerland and norway .
canada also takes part in some projects under a co-operation agreement .
its mission is to shape the development of europe 's space capability .
its objectives are scientific and industrial ; and the latter is reflected in its funding arrangements .
the agency invests in the space industry in each member-state roughly equal to the amount of money the member-state pays into esa .
esa has had many significant successes in space exploration .
it has developed a launch site in french guiana , become a major player in the business of commercial satellites , trained an astronaut corps and has contributed the columbus laboratory to the international space station .
it is also developing its own , controversial , global navigation system called galileo .
but critics of esa say it belongs to another age when european space activities were seen as a bridge between the american and soviet space racers ; and it is time it lost its dependence on others .
europe has no means of getting its own astronauts into space , for example .
now , documents seen by the bbc indicate that the french plans for an overhaul of esa are at an advanced stage .
the papers say that a politically-led space enterprise is necessary for europe to be taken seriously in the international arena .
the documents talk about the manned exploration of mars and the need for europe to play an " indispensable " part .
funding issues commenting on the issue of mars , the french official agreed it was now on the agenda .
" the french impetus would be to say that a european contribution to a human flight mission to mars is something we should set as an objective .
it 's exactly this kind of question that needs to be answered - this is highly political .
you have to say , do you want to go human , to the moon first , or do you want to go directly to mars , which is the french position .
" these are all political questions , of course .
you can turn them into science , but they are political questions and esa can not answer them and this is why we need a political element . "
alan cooper says that political leadership which comes with extra resources would be very welcome at esa .
" if we are focussing on the question of whether we welcome an increase in political interest in space in europe - clearly , yes , if that results in higher goals and the investment to match , we would be extremely happy about that .
" it 's tempting to use a phrase like , ' he who pays the piper calls the tune ' , but really it 's down to accountability .
if you are accountable for the money you are spending , then you determine the rules under which it is spent .
if someone else is raising that money , they have that accountability .
" i think what you are talking about is fundamentally changing the aims of esa and if you want a fundamental shift in goals for esa then it 's got to be a decision for all the member states . "
joint interests according to the french , the uk is their model partner in this endeavour .
the two countries had similar views on how business should be encouraged to get involved in space to develop commercial opportunities .
and the two countries were now of the same view when it came to exploration , he said .
" it is mainly since the arrival of our new president that we have come up with a pretty british type of idea , " the french official added .
" britain has always been pushing for exploration and by discussing our plans , we have had quite a good reaction from the british national space centre and from the ministry . "
but not everyone is happy with this political approach ; and the french acknowledge there will be serious opposition from some countries .
" people are very much attached to the esa which we understand .
but this attachment translates into keeping the status quo , and we think this is not a good position ; we think that europe now needs political support otherwise the chinese or the indians will overtake us . "
the french eu presidency also coincides with the next major meeting of esa member-state ministers in november , when many of these issues are sure to be aired .
the acknowledgement that eu and esa interests increasingly overlap led to the creation in 2004 of a space council in which shared concerns could be discussed .
some space projects , such as the galileo satellite-navigation system , are deemed so fundamental to the future economic well being of the eu that the driving force to implement them comes direct from the european commission in brussels .

it wants to kick-start a revolution in space by letting eu politicians not bureaucrats decide on priorities for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
the french say that if europe fails to change its approach to space , it will fall behind japan , china and india .
paris is seeking an alliance with the uk to drive the agenda forward during the french presidency of the eu .
' political pilot ' president nicolas sarkozy 's well-known admiration for all things american now extends to space exploration .
speaking to the bbc , a senior official involved in french space policy said that it was time to shake up the european space agency and make it more like the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- by giving it a new , politically-led direction .
the french take over the rotating presidency of the european union on 1 july and are planning to make space policy a key area for reform .
the official said that europe was in danger of becoming redundant in global space terms and it needed an agency that followed a clear political agenda .
president sarkozy has big ambitions in space " the united states , russia , china and japan would not do what they do in space without a political motivation ; europe has only had a scientific motivation until now .
so what we are saying is , let 's get the same chances as the others .
" beside the scientific pilot , let us have a political pilot , too , which will be the eu , because there is only the eu that can speak at that level . "
but alan cooper , european space policy implementation manager with esa in paris , says that comparisons with nasa are unfair .
" nasa has the reputation it has on the strength of the programmes it has delivered , " he told bbc news .
" it spends seven or eight times as much as esa spends in a year .
its profile you would expect then to be seven or eight times higher than esa .
if you want the european space programme to have the same impact , it will need a higher profile and the investment to match those goals . "
record of success the european space agency was formed in 1975 , and its seventeen member-states include countries outside the eu - switzerland and norway .
canada also takes part in some projects under a co-operation agreement .
its mission is to shape the development of europe 's space capability .
its objectives are scientific and industrial ; and the latter is reflected in its funding arrangements .
the agency invests in the space industry in each member-state roughly equal to the amount of money the member-state pays into esa .
a current debate centres on europe having an independent crew vehicle esa has had many significant successes in space exploration .
it has developed a launch site in french guiana , become a major player in the business of commercial satellites , trained an astronaut corps and has contributed the columbus laboratory to the international space station .
it is also developing its own , controversial , global navigation system called galileo .
but critics of esa say it belongs to another age when european space activities were seen as a bridge between the american and soviet space racers ; and it is time it lost its dependence on others .
europe has no means of getting its own astronauts into space , for example .
now , documents seen by the bbc indicate that the french plans for an overhaul of esa are at an advanced stage .
the papers say that a politically-led space enterprise is necessary for europe to be taken seriously in the international arena .
the documents talk about the manned exploration of mars and the need for europe to play an " indispensable " part .
funding issues commenting on the issue of mars , the french official agreed it was now on the agenda .
" the french impetus would be to say that a european contribution to a human flight mission to mars is something we should set as an objective .
it 's exactly this kind of question that needs to be answered - this is highly political .
you have to say , do you want to go human , to the moon first , or do you want to go directly to mars , which is the french position .
plans at present only extend to the robotic exploration of mars " these are all political questions , of course .
you can turn them into science , but they are political questions and esa can not answer them and this is why we need a political element . "
alan cooper says that political leadership which comes with extra resources would be very welcome at esa .
" if we are focussing on the question of whether we welcome an increase in political interest in space in europe - clearly , yes , if that results in higher goals and the investment to match , we would be extremely happy about that .
" it 's tempting to use a phrase like , ' he who pays the piper calls the tune ' , but really it 's down to accountability .
if you are accountable for the money you are spending , then you determine the rules under which it is spent .
if someone else is raising that money , they have that accountability .
" i think what you are talking about is fundamentally changing the aims of esa and if you want a fundamental shift in goals for esa then it 's got to be a decision for all the member states . "
joint interests according to the french , the uk is their model partner in this endeavour .
the two countries had similar views on how business should be encouraged to get involved in space to develop commercial opportunities .
and the two countries were now of the same view when it came to exploration , he said .
" it is mainly since the arrival of our new president that we have come up with a pretty british type of idea , " the french official added .
" britain has always been pushing for exploration and by discussing our plans , we have had quite a good reaction from the british national space centre and from the ministry . "
france hosts europe 's spaceport at kourou , french guiana but not everyone is happy with this political approach ; and the french acknowledge there will be serious opposition from some countries .
" people are very much attached to the esa which we understand .
but this attachment translates into keeping the status quo , and we think this is not a good position ; we think that europe now needs political support otherwise the chinese or the indians will overtake us . "
the french eu presidency also coincides with the next major meeting of esa member-state ministers in november , when many of these issues are sure to be aired .
the acknowledgement that eu and esa interests increasingly overlap led to the creation in 2004 of a space council in which shared concerns could be discussed .
some space projects , such as the galileo satellite-navigation system , are deemed so fundamental to the future economic well being of the eu that the driving force to implement them comes direct from the european commission in brussels .
