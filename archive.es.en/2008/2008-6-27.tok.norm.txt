euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .
these were safe and we will ensure that the world cup is no different , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we came here to win the tournament , " cesc fabregas , one of the stars of the night , said .
" in a final anything can happen , but right now we have to enjoy the moment . " fabregas was rushed into action after 34 minutes after a muscle injury to david villa , who is now a major doubt for the final , and the arsenal man said he would play any part he is asked to against germany . " it 's up to the boss but i will be here as soon as he needs me , " said fabregas . russia could n't keep up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia just got tired too soon , said their coach russia had stunned holland in the previous round , with andrei arshavin at the center of all their best moves , but he and the entire russian side were well short of their best in the ernst happel stadium this time around . " arshavin plays very freely so we decided that in every area one player was meant to keep an eye on him .
if -lsb- marcos -rsb- senna left him then another player took up the job , " said aragones of how spain snuffed out the threat from the zenit st. petersburg star . " we lost against a very good opponent .
spain is a very good team , " admitted russia coach guus hiddink .
" we were able to keep to their level for nearly an hour .
that was their plan to make us tired and we could not keep with them in the second half . " but we can be proud to have gotten to this stage . " spain cashes in during second half in steady rain , spain , who had squeezed past italy on penalties in the quarter-finals , dominated possession in a frenetic opening and villa and fernando torres caused the russia defense all sorts of problems . the only surprise was that it took as long as 50 minutes for spain to go ahead , and xavi side-footed them in front after a cross-shot from andres iniesta . guiza and xabi alonso replaced xavi and torres and spain went further ahead 17 minutes from time , a lovely lofted pass from fabregas setting up guiza , who finished neatly . fabregas was the provider once again , eight minutes from the end , slotting the ball perfectly into the path of silva , who found the corner with a fine left-foot finish . arshavin almost pulled one back late on but iker casillas saved well and spain ran out convincing winners . spain reluctant favorites against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain may be favored , but they have less experience in the finals than germany " we started the game playing the kind of football russia likes with longer balls but when we started moving the ball around that is when we started doing well , both defensively and offensively , " said aragones . " we passed the ball very well .
when we came to the tournament we realized that we had a good team and could get very far .
we have learned how to compete . " arogones refused to accept his side would now start as favorites against germany , despite joachim loew 's side having had an inconsistent tournament to date . " i do n't know if there is a favorite .
maybe germany can be considered favorites because they are more used to getting to finals than we are , " said aragones of the three-time winners . " but it 's very difficult to stop us when we move the ball very quickly .

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .
gazprom 's large shtokman field in northern russia is due to come online in 2014 , executives said .
banking on government support miller sees a rosy future for gazprom .
its strong ties to the government give it a huge growth potential and it aims to become the world 's energy leader , the ceo said friday .
russian president dmitry medvedev , who took office last month , previously served as chairman of the state-controlled gas giant .

images of the documents are gradually being sent to washington and jerusalem .
shapiro , who is chief historian at the us national holocaust museum in washington , dc was in bad arolsen on thursday , june 26 .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .
these were safe and we will ensure that the world cup is no different , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation . " ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized countries meeting in kyoto on friday also strongly condemned the one-man vote in zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote . " we will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said in a statement . us threatens sanctions " none of us believe that the quote-unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters . " there is no legitimacy for a government claiming election on the basis of today 's events because this was an election which was one sided in every aspect , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe casting his vote in harare us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the un security council could consider sanctions against the regime . " there was strong , strong sentiment in that room today that what is going on in zimbabwe is simply unacceptable in the 21st century and should not be ignored by the international community , " rice told reporters . italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government would propose that eu ambassadors withdraw from zimbabwe . zimbabwe is also expected to dominate the agenda at a meeting of african union foreign ministers at a summit in sharm el-sheikh , egypt . a security committee of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed , saying mugabe 's re-election could lack legitimacy . minister slams german paper firm separately , germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on friday pressed a munich-based specialist paper firm to halt deliveries of banknote paper to zimbabwe , saying it was helping to prop up the mugabe government . the company , giesecke & devrient -lrb- g & d -rrb- , is under fire in the german media for continuing to trade with the ostracized regime . a ministry spokesman said wieczorek-zeul had pointed out to the company it was signatory to a code of conduct that included a human rights clause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign on a battered wall points the way to a polling station in the city of bulawayo a dozen human rights activists demonstrated in front of the company headquarters in munich on friday , holding up banners reading : " no cash for terror . " a g & d spokesman repeated friday that it was company policy not to comment on individual clients .
" we stick strictly to world bank rules with all our deliveries , " he said . the spokesman said deliveries of banknotes went to central banks and not to governments . the deliveries have been widely reported in the german and british press , along with allegations that mugabe is keeping himself in power by literally printing money to pay his ministers and supporters . g & d is reported to provide banknote paper to more than 100 countries and to be the largest printer of euro banknotes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .
" these are horrible things even to imagine , " said bekim collaku .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom .

the lower house , the bundestag , passed the necessary legislation in april .
the left said in berlin its twin applications , placed before the court on wednesday , were based on the grounds that the treaty infringed the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
the first related to the division of powers between the main organs of state , the upper and lower houses of parliament , the constitutional court and the president .
some see parliamentary power at stake left parliamentary caucus head gregor gysi said parliamentary powers were at stake , along with those of the court itself , although he said he was a " firm supporter of european integration . "
the left sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament .
in the second , left member of parliament diether dehm applied to the court on the grounds that the rights of members of parliament were infringed .
" this false , soulless and militaristic treaty will endanger the eu , " dehm said .
a maverick member of parliament , peter gauweiler of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has applied to the court to strike down the treaty of lisbon on similar grounds .
treaty 's future in germany rests on high court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court will rule on the treaty although both houses of parliament have passed the treaty , president horst koehler has delayed signing it into law pending a decision by the constitutional court .
the treaty streamlines the workings of the eu , establishes the office of a president and enlarges the powers of the eu 's foreign policy chief .
it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
the irish electorate rejected the treaty in a referendum earlier this month .
the other 26 members aim to ratify through their parliaments , and 18 have done so , but the treaty faces a constitutional hurdle in the czech republic . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the european union fights for its future despite the no vote from dublin , numerous politicians are fighting to save the lisbon treaty .
but should it be saved ? -lrb- 27.06.2008 -rrb- eu puts troubled treaty on hold as fresh problems erupt eu leaders ended a key summit friday by putting the embattled reform treaty on hold until october and clashing over whether the bloc could keep taking in new member states without it .
-lrb- 20.06.2008 -rrb- fading hopes of rapid solution to irish no-vote ireland has dashed eu hopes of a quick solution to the bloc 's latest institutional crisis by saying it was unlikely to come up with a solution at the next summit in october .

the lower house , the bundestag , passed the necessary legislation in april .
the left said in berlin its twin applications , placed before the court on wednesday , were based on the grounds that the treaty infringed the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
the first related to the division of powers between the main organs of state , the upper and lower houses of parliament , the constitutional court and the president .
some see parliamentary power at stake left parliamentary caucus head gregor gysi said parliamentary powers were at stake , along with those of the court itself , although he said he was a " firm supporter of european integration . "

the lower house , the bundestag , passed the necessary legislation in april .
the left said in berlin its twin applications , placed before the court on wednesday , were based on the grounds that the treaty infringed the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
the first related to the division of powers between the main organs of state , the upper and lower houses of parliament , the constitutional court and the president .
some see parliamentary power at stake left parliamentary caucus head gregor gysi said parliamentary powers were at stake , along with those of the court itself , although he said he was a " firm supporter of european integration . "
the left sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament .
in the second , left member of parliament diether dehm applied to the court on the grounds that the rights of members of parliament were infringed .
" this false , soulless and militaristic treaty will endanger the eu , " dehm said .
a maverick member of parliament , peter gauweiler of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has applied to the court to strike down the treaty of lisbon on similar grounds .
treaty 's future in germany rests on high court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court will rule on the treaty although both houses of parliament have passed the treaty , president horst koehler has delayed signing it into law pending a decision by the constitutional court .
the treaty streamlines the workings of the eu , establishes the office of a president and enlarges the powers of the eu 's foreign policy chief .
it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
the irish electorate rejected the treaty in a referendum earlier this month .
the other 26 members aim to ratify through their parliaments , and 18 have done so , but the treaty faces a constitutional hurdle in the czech republic . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .

the lower house , the bundestag , passed the necessary legislation in april .
the left said in berlin its twin applications , placed before the court on wednesday , were based on the grounds that the treaty infringed the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
the first related to the division of powers between the main organs of state , the upper and lower houses of parliament , the constitutional court and the president .
some see parliamentary power at stake left parliamentary caucus head gregor gysi said parliamentary powers were at stake , along with those of the court itself , although he said he was a " firm supporter of european integration . "
the left sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament .
in the second , left member of parliament diether dehm applied to the court on the grounds that the rights of members of parliament were infringed .
" this false , soulless and militaristic treaty will endanger the eu , " dehm said .
a maverick member of parliament , peter gauweiler of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has applied to the court to strike down the treaty of lisbon on similar grounds .
treaty 's future in germany rests on high court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court will rule on the treaty although both houses of parliament have passed the treaty , president horst koehler has delayed signing it into law pending a decision by the constitutional court .
the treaty streamlines the workings of the eu , establishes the office of a president and enlarges the powers of the eu 's foreign policy chief .
it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
the irish electorate rejected the treaty in a referendum earlier this month .
the other 26 members aim to ratify through their parliaments , and 18 have done so , but the treaty faces a constitutional hurdle in the czech republic . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

" we came here to win the tournament , " cesc fabregas , one of the stars of the night , said .
" in a final anything can happen , but right now we have to enjoy the moment . " fabregas was rushed into action after 34 minutes after a muscle injury to david villa , who is now a major doubt for the final , and the arsenal man said he would play any part he is asked to against germany . " it 's up to the boss but i will be here as soon as he needs me , " said fabregas . russia could n't keep up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia just got tired too soon , said their coach russia had stunned holland in the previous round , with andrei arshavin at the center of all their best moves , but he and the entire russian side were well short of their best in the ernst happel stadium this time around . " arshavin plays very freely so we decided that in every area one player was meant to keep an eye on him .
if -lsb- marcos -rsb- senna left him then another player took up the job , " said aragones of how spain snuffed out the threat from the zenit st. petersburg star . " we lost against a very good opponent .
spain is a very good team , " admitted russia coach guus hiddink .
" we were able to keep to their level for nearly an hour .
that was their plan to make us tired and we could not keep with them in the second half . " but we can be proud to have gotten to this stage . " spain cashes in during second half in steady rain , spain , who had squeezed past italy on penalties in the quarter-finals , dominated possession in a frenetic opening and villa and fernando torres caused the russia defense all sorts of problems . the only surprise was that it took as long as 50 minutes for spain to go ahead , and xavi side-footed them in front after a cross-shot from andres iniesta . guiza and xabi alonso replaced xavi and torres and spain went further ahead 17 minutes from time , a lovely lofted pass from fabregas setting up guiza , who finished neatly . fabregas was the provider once again , eight minutes from the end , slotting the ball perfectly into the path of silva , who found the corner with a fine left-foot finish . arshavin almost pulled one back late on but iker casillas saved well and spain ran out convincing winners . spain reluctant favorites against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain may be favored , but they have less experience in the finals than germany " we started the game playing the kind of football russia likes with longer balls but when we started moving the ball around that is when we started doing well , both defensively and offensively , " said aragones . " we passed the ball very well .
when we came to the tournament we realized that we had a good team and could get very far .
we have learned how to compete . " arogones refused to accept his side would now start as favorites against germany , despite joachim loew 's side having had an inconsistent tournament to date . " i do n't know if there is a favorite .
maybe germany can be considered favorites because they are more used to getting to finals than we are , " said aragones of the three-time winners . " but it 's very difficult to stop us when we move the ball very quickly .
the russians got tired .
the germans might be better physically but in the end our pace could tire them , " he added . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.06.2008 gordon brown battles for political future after a year in power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's authority is in tatters one year after being in office british prime minister gordon brown 's year in office since taking over from tony blair has been calamitous .
few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 russia , eu turn new page on bilateral relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - eu chiefs with medvedev , second from right russia and the european union on friday announced the beginning of talks on a long-delayed strategic partnership accord , with russian president medvedev hailing a new chapter in their sometimes tense relationship . the two sides , meeting in a concert hall in the oil-rich siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , said negotiations would begin july 4 in brussels on a new partnership and cooperation agreement , an overarching treaty to replace an old accord that expired last year . " today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .
" these are horrible things even to imagine , " said bekim collaku .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .

what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .

it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .

" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .

" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .

afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .

" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.06.2008 germany pays biggest share of europe 's budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries pay in more than others germany paid more than any other country for its membership in the european union , 114 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- .
greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lower house , the bundestag , passed the necessary legislation in april .
the left said in berlin its twin applications , placed before the court on wednesday , were based on the grounds that the treaty infringed the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
the first related to the division of powers between the main organs of state , the upper and lower houses of parliament , the constitutional court and the president .
some see parliamentary power at stake left parliamentary caucus head gregor gysi said parliamentary powers were at stake , along with those of the court itself , although he said he was a " firm supporter of european integration . "
the left sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament .
in the second , left member of parliament diether dehm applied to the court on the grounds that the rights of members of parliament were infringed .
" this false , soulless and militaristic treaty will endanger the eu , " dehm said .
a maverick member of parliament , peter gauweiler of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has applied to the court to strike down the treaty of lisbon on similar grounds .
treaty 's future in germany rests on high court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court will rule on the treaty although both houses of parliament have passed the treaty , president horst koehler has delayed signing it into law pending a decision by the constitutional court .
the treaty streamlines the workings of the eu , establishes the office of a president and enlarges the powers of the eu 's foreign policy chief .
it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 report : georgia offers russia deal over separatist abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the alleged offer , georgia would pull its troops into the north of abkhazia in what could prove to be the first breakthrough in the stand-off over its separatist abkhazia region , georgia has made an offer to russia to divide the region into zones of influence , a russian paper claims . according to the russian kommersant broadsheet , georgia also offered to renounce its goal to join nato , a flashpoint topic for the russian administration .
the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .
friday 's report comes as top european union officials were expected to touch on georgia at talks in siberia with russian president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .

" all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation . " ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized countries meeting in kyoto on friday also strongly condemned the one-man vote in zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote . " we will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said in a statement . us threatens sanctions " none of us believe that the quote-unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters .

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .
gazprom 's large shtokman field in northern russia is due to come online in 2014 , executives said .
banking on government support miller sees a rosy future for gazprom .
its strong ties to the government give it a huge growth potential and it aims to become the world 's energy leader , the ceo said friday .
russian president dmitry medvedev , who took office last month , previously served as chairman of the state-controlled gas giant .
gazprom announced friday that medvedev 's replacement as chairman will be former prime minister viktor zubkov . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .
" these are horrible things even to imagine , " said bekim collaku .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .

" today 's election is a sham .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.06.2008 germany pays biggest share of europe 's budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries pay in more than others germany paid more than any other country for its membership in the european union , 114 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- .
greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 report : georgia offers russia deal over separatist abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the alleged offer , georgia would pull its troops into the north of abkhazia in what could prove to be the first breakthrough in the stand-off over its separatist abkhazia region , georgia has made an offer to russia to divide the region into zones of influence , a russian paper claims . according to the russian kommersant broadsheet , georgia also offered to renounce its goal to join nato , a flashpoint topic for the russian administration .
the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .
friday 's report comes as top european union officials were expected to touch on georgia at talks in siberia with russian president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .
gazprom 's large shtokman field in northern russia is due to come online in 2014 , executives said .
banking on government support miller sees a rosy future for gazprom .
its strong ties to the government give it a huge growth potential and it aims to become the world 's energy leader , the ceo said friday .
russian president dmitry medvedev , who took office last month , previously served as chairman of the state-controlled gas giant .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .
friday 's report comes as top european union officials were expected to touch on georgia at talks in siberia with russian president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.06.2008 gordon brown battles for political future after a year in power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's authority is in tatters one year after being in office british prime minister gordon brown 's year in office since taking over from tony blair has been calamitous .
few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .
" and if the economy is n't working then you inevitably blame the government . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.06.2008 gordon brown battles for political future after a year in power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's authority is in tatters one year after being in office british prime minister gordon brown 's year in office since taking over from tony blair has been calamitous .
few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .
" and if the economy is n't working then you inevitably blame the government . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .

" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 russia , eu turn new page on bilateral relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - eu chiefs with medvedev , second from right russia and the european union on friday announced the beginning of talks on a long-delayed strategic partnership accord , with russian president medvedev hailing a new chapter in their sometimes tense relationship . the two sides , meeting in a concert hall in the oil-rich siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , said negotiations would begin july 4 in brussels on a new partnership and cooperation agreement , an overarching treaty to replace an old accord that expired last year . " today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote .

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation . " ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized countries meeting in kyoto on friday also strongly condemned the one-man vote in zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote . " we will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said in a statement . us threatens sanctions " none of us believe that the quote-unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters . " there is no legitimacy for a government claiming election on the basis of today 's events because this was an election which was one sided in every aspect , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe casting his vote in harare us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the un security council could consider sanctions against the regime . " there was strong , strong sentiment in that room today that what is going on in zimbabwe is simply unacceptable in the 21st century and should not be ignored by the international community , " rice told reporters . italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government would propose that eu ambassadors withdraw from zimbabwe . zimbabwe is also expected to dominate the agenda at a meeting of african union foreign ministers at a summit in sharm el-sheikh , egypt . a security committee of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed , saying mugabe 's re-election could lack legitimacy . minister slams german paper firm separately , germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on friday pressed a munich-based specialist paper firm to halt deliveries of banknote paper to zimbabwe , saying it was helping to prop up the mugabe government . the company , giesecke & devrient -lrb- g & d -rrb- , is under fire in the german media for continuing to trade with the ostracized regime . a ministry spokesman said wieczorek-zeul had pointed out to the company it was signatory to a code of conduct that included a human rights clause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign on a battered wall points the way to a polling station in the city of bulawayo a dozen human rights activists demonstrated in front of the company headquarters in munich on friday , holding up banners reading : " no cash for terror . " a g & d spokesman repeated friday that it was company policy not to comment on individual clients .
" we stick strictly to world bank rules with all our deliveries , " he said . the spokesman said deliveries of banknotes went to central banks and not to governments . the deliveries have been widely reported in the german and british press , along with allegations that mugabe is keeping himself in power by literally printing money to pay his ministers and supporters . g & d is reported to provide banknote paper to more than 100 countries and to be the largest printer of euro banknotes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today 's election is a sham .

he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 report : georgia offers russia deal over separatist abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the alleged offer , georgia would pull its troops into the north of abkhazia in what could prove to be the first breakthrough in the stand-off over its separatist abkhazia region , georgia has made an offer to russia to divide the region into zones of influence , a russian paper claims . according to the russian kommersant broadsheet , georgia also offered to renounce its goal to join nato , a flashpoint topic for the russian administration .
the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .

blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .

the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

dw-world.de opinion : new police cars not enough for middle east peace mideast talks in berlin might not have produced dramatic results , says dw 's peter philipp , but if the international community insists that israelis and palestinians compromise , progress could be made .

meanwhile , a six-day truce between israel and palestinian militants was broken with an attack .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .

" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .

" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we came here to win the tournament , " cesc fabregas , one of the stars of the night , said .
" in a final anything can happen , but right now we have to enjoy the moment . " fabregas was rushed into action after 34 minutes after a muscle injury to david villa , who is now a major doubt for the final , and the arsenal man said he would play any part he is asked to against germany . " it 's up to the boss but i will be here as soon as he needs me , " said fabregas . russia could n't keep up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia just got tired too soon , said their coach russia had stunned holland in the previous round , with andrei arshavin at the center of all their best moves , but he and the entire russian side were well short of their best in the ernst happel stadium this time around . " arshavin plays very freely so we decided that in every area one player was meant to keep an eye on him .
if -lsb- marcos -rsb- senna left him then another player took up the job , " said aragones of how spain snuffed out the threat from the zenit st. petersburg star . " we lost against a very good opponent .
spain is a very good team , " admitted russia coach guus hiddink .
" we were able to keep to their level for nearly an hour .
that was their plan to make us tired and we could not keep with them in the second half . " but we can be proud to have gotten to this stage . " spain cashes in during second half in steady rain , spain , who had squeezed past italy on penalties in the quarter-finals , dominated possession in a frenetic opening and villa and fernando torres caused the russia defense all sorts of problems . the only surprise was that it took as long as 50 minutes for spain to go ahead , and xavi side-footed them in front after a cross-shot from andres iniesta . guiza and xabi alonso replaced xavi and torres and spain went further ahead 17 minutes from time , a lovely lofted pass from fabregas setting up guiza , who finished neatly . fabregas was the provider once again , eight minutes from the end , slotting the ball perfectly into the path of silva , who found the corner with a fine left-foot finish . arshavin almost pulled one back late on but iker casillas saved well and spain ran out convincing winners . spain reluctant favorites against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain may be favored , but they have less experience in the finals than germany " we started the game playing the kind of football russia likes with longer balls but when we started moving the ball around that is when we started doing well , both defensively and offensively , " said aragones . " we passed the ball very well .
when we came to the tournament we realized that we had a good team and could get very far .
we have learned how to compete . " arogones refused to accept his side would now start as favorites against germany , despite joachim loew 's side having had an inconsistent tournament to date . " i do n't know if there is a favorite .
maybe germany can be considered favorites because they are more used to getting to finals than we are , " said aragones of the three-time winners . " but it 's very difficult to stop us when we move the ball very quickly .
the russians got tired .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.06.2008 gordon brown battles for political future after a year in power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's authority is in tatters one year after being in office british prime minister gordon brown 's year in office since taking over from tony blair has been calamitous .
few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .
gazprom 's large shtokman field in northern russia is due to come online in 2014 , executives said .
banking on government support miller sees a rosy future for gazprom .
its strong ties to the government give it a huge growth potential and it aims to become the world 's energy leader , the ceo said friday .
russian president dmitry medvedev , who took office last month , previously served as chairman of the state-controlled gas giant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 russia , eu turn new page on bilateral relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - eu chiefs with medvedev , second from right russia and the european union on friday announced the beginning of talks on a long-delayed strategic partnership accord , with russian president medvedev hailing a new chapter in their sometimes tense relationship . the two sides , meeting in a concert hall in the oil-rich siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , said negotiations would begin july 4 in brussels on a new partnership and cooperation agreement , an overarching treaty to replace an old accord that expired last year . " today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .

the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .

" all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .

" we stick strictly to world bank rules with all our deliveries , " he said . the spokesman said deliveries of banknotes went to central banks and not to governments . the deliveries have been widely reported in the german and british press , along with allegations that mugabe is keeping himself in power by literally printing money to pay his ministers and supporters . g & d is reported to provide banknote paper to more than 100 countries and to be the largest printer of euro banknotes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the second , left member of parliament diether dehm applied to the court on the grounds that the rights of members of parliament were infringed .
" this false , soulless and militaristic treaty will endanger the eu , " dehm said .
a maverick member of parliament , peter gauweiler of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has applied to the court to strike down the treaty of lisbon on similar grounds .
treaty 's future in germany rests on high court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court will rule on the treaty although both houses of parliament have passed the treaty , president horst koehler has delayed signing it into law pending a decision by the constitutional court .
the treaty streamlines the workings of the eu , establishes the office of a president and enlarges the powers of the eu 's foreign policy chief .
it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
the irish electorate rejected the treaty in a referendum earlier this month .
the other 26 members aim to ratify through their parliaments , and 18 have done so , but the treaty faces a constitutional hurdle in the czech republic . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

dw-world.de opinion : new police cars not enough for middle east peace mideast talks in berlin might not have produced dramatic results , says dw 's peter philipp , but if the international community insists that israelis and palestinians compromise , progress could be made .
-lrb- 25.06.2008 -rrb- donors pledge millions for palestinian security delegates at a major conference in berlin pledged millions to help palestinians improve state institutions .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .

the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia .

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community .

the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .

" all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia .

russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation . " ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized countries meeting in kyoto on friday also strongly condemned the one-man vote in zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote . " we will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said in a statement . us threatens sanctions " none of us believe that the quote-unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .

according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .

rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .
" and if the economy is n't working then you inevitably blame the government . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .
" these are horrible things even to imagine , " said bekim collaku .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia . " it is an area where our interdependence is very strong , and it is only natural that this should be reflected in the new agreement , " he said . russian officials said holding talks in oil-rich khanty-mansiysk was symbolic .
the region accounts for about 40 per cent of the country 's exports , of which the eu is biggest customer . russia , after the us and china , is the third-biggest foreign trade partner for the eu . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation . " ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized countries meeting in kyoto on friday also strongly condemned the one-man vote in zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote . " we will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said in a statement . us threatens sanctions " none of us believe that the quote-unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters . " there is no legitimacy for a government claiming election on the basis of today 's events because this was an election which was one sided in every aspect , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe casting his vote in harare us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the un security council could consider sanctions against the regime . " there was strong , strong sentiment in that room today that what is going on in zimbabwe is simply unacceptable in the 21st century and should not be ignored by the international community , " rice told reporters . italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government would propose that eu ambassadors withdraw from zimbabwe . zimbabwe is also expected to dominate the agenda at a meeting of african union foreign ministers at a summit in sharm el-sheikh , egypt . a security committee of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed , saying mugabe 's re-election could lack legitimacy . minister slams german paper firm separately , germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on friday pressed a munich-based specialist paper firm to halt deliveries of banknote paper to zimbabwe , saying it was helping to prop up the mugabe government . the company , giesecke & devrient -lrb- g & d -rrb- , is under fire in the german media for continuing to trade with the ostracized regime . a ministry spokesman said wieczorek-zeul had pointed out to the company it was signatory to a code of conduct that included a human rights clause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign on a battered wall points the way to a polling station in the city of bulawayo a dozen human rights activists demonstrated in front of the company headquarters in munich on friday , holding up banners reading : " no cash for terror .

" we stick strictly to world bank rules with all our deliveries , " he said . the spokesman said deliveries of banknotes went to central banks and not to governments . the deliveries have been widely reported in the german and british press , along with allegations that mugabe is keeping himself in power by literally printing money to pay his ministers and supporters . g & d is reported to provide banknote paper to more than 100 countries and to be the largest printer of euro banknotes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 russia , eu turn new page on bilateral relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - eu chiefs with medvedev , second from right russia and the european union on friday announced the beginning of talks on a long-delayed strategic partnership accord , with russian president medvedev hailing a new chapter in their sometimes tense relationship . the two sides , meeting in a concert hall in the oil-rich siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , said negotiations would begin july 4 in brussels on a new partnership and cooperation agreement , an overarching treaty to replace an old accord that expired last year . " today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

dw-world.de opinion : new police cars not enough for middle east peace mideast talks in berlin might not have produced dramatic results , says dw 's peter philipp , but if the international community insists that israelis and palestinians compromise , progress could be made .
-lrb- 25.06.2008 -rrb- donors pledge millions for palestinian security delegates at a major conference in berlin pledged millions to help palestinians improve state institutions .
meanwhile , a six-day truce between israel and palestinian militants was broken with an attack .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .

the charges that kosovo albanian rebels had profited from selling human organs of captured serbians was first brought forward in the book " the hunt : me and the war criminals " by carla del ponte , the former chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
del ponte 's book alleges that as many as 400 victims , most of them serbs , were subjected to forced organ extraction .
human rights watch said it has collaborated del ponte 's allegations .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly decided on wednesday , june 25 , that the claims merit a full investigatation .
marty , a swiss lawyer who became famous for investigating cia rendition flights through europe , was asked by the 47-nation , pan-european organization to investigate .
the council did not say when marty would travel to the region .
he is also undertaking an investigation of human rights in chechnya , ingushetia and dagestan on behalf of the council .
kosovo denies charges albanian foreign minister lulzim basha has called the allegations " inventions and absurdities . "
a senior adviser to hashim thaci , kosovo 's prime minister and a leading member of the kosovo liberation army which is accused of benefiting from the trade , denied the allegations after del ponte 's book was published this spring .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .

according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .

germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .

" today 's election is a sham .
the election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a european commission spokeswoman said . mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai withdrew because of state-backed violence against his supporters . the 84-year-old mugabe is the only candidate in friday 's vote . " exercise in mass intimidation " tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed . there were reports friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink-stained finger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
pro-mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said . tsvangirai said at a press conference friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " he added : " what is happening today is not an election .
it is an exercise in mass intimidation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 russia , eu turn new page on bilateral relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men in black - eu chiefs with medvedev , second from right russia and the european union on friday announced the beginning of talks on a long-delayed strategic partnership accord , with russian president medvedev hailing a new chapter in their sometimes tense relationship . the two sides , meeting in a concert hall in the oil-rich siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , said negotiations would begin july 4 in brussels on a new partnership and cooperation agreement , an overarching treaty to replace an old accord that expired last year . " today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between the eu and russia may ease under medvedev earlier , eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " ferrero-waldner stressed the eu 's stance that the new eu-russia partnership deal should set binding legal foundations for relations .
the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . energy , security issues take priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the west-siberian city of khanty-mansiysk , host of the summit in his remarks friday , medvedev went into more specifics about the idea he first floated in berlin for a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia .

" today we have opened a new page , " 42-year-old medvedev , who is seeking a thaw in the icy relations with the european union that developed under his predecessor vladimir putin , said .
he added that the new pact would open new horizons . the talks offered eu leaders their first chance to assess medvedev , who took office last month after previously serving as deputy prime minister and chairman of russia 's state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " a new chapter " " i believe this new agreement should open a new chapter in our relations , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a news conference .
" i particularly welcome president medvedev 's recent comments about strengthening the rule of law and working together as responsible members of the international community .

the eu has clashed with moscow over human rights , democracy and the separatist georgian region of abkhazia - all issues raised at friday 's formal session . differences on new accord the centrepiece of the three-hour meeting was the formal launch of negotiations on a new strategic agreement governing the sometimes strained relations between the eu and russia , its third biggest trading partner . analysts say the negotiations will offer both sides a chance to size up the political will to overcome a host of problems in the energy and security sectors before a deal can be brokered . brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .

" all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev demanded , while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . on other issues , the eu and russia backed a new baltic sea pipeline - a controversial issue within the eu - which is to transport russian natural gas to germany . medvedev said the so-called nord stream project was a purely business venture which had been damaged by being politicized .
barroso demanded that the pipeline must meet environmental protection standards . ahead of the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had remarked that " the whole complex of energy-related issues is one of the most important elements of our relations with russia .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .

" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .

" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2008 opinion : blair taking small steps toward middle east peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has kept busy in the year since he left office .
he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

he has taken on the thankless job of an envoy to the middle east and has made some progress , said deutsche welle 's peter phillip . for years , british prime minister tony blair stood by us president george w. bush 's side as his faithful friend and ally .
while some see blair 's appointment as the middle east quartet 's special envoy as a friendly favor , there are likely other reasons he was appointed on june 27 , 2007 , the same day he stepped down as prime minister .
yes , blair blindly followed washington into war in afghanistan and iraq , but he also significantly contributed to the success of peace negotiations with northern ireland and to end the war in sierra leone .
blair likely never suspected what kind of a mission he had accepted , although there were sufficient warning signs .
his predecessor , former world bank head james wolfensohn , held the job less than a year before packing it in , frustrated in april of 2006 .
no one was found to replace him until blair came , bringing significant baggage with him .
blair was seen as a representative of british ex-colonial power , as the right hand of israel 's close ally , bush , and as an occupying force in iraq .
but blair seems to have taken to his new task , the goals of which are fairly narrowly defined .
the us , the european union , russia and the united nations , which make up the " quartet , " gave him the job of helping palestinians build and rebuild their infrastructure .
this will help living conditions to normalize so that they can gradually begin to create a palestinian state .
blair faces a long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp being actively involved in peace negotiations is not a part of the former prime minister 's mandate .
and it is good that way , because blair would face a great number of road blocks .
the arab side , due to the resentments already mentioned , would particularly mistrust him .
soon after blair was appointed , the islamist hamas organization openly and clearly stated that the group did not believe that blair could take a neutral position and that it would not cooperate with him .
the threat would hardly have impressed blair , as he , like bush and the israeli regime , is a staunch believer that no one should talk to or work with hamas until the group accepts israel 's right to exist and respects agreements between the plo and israel , in particular the oslo accords .
as hamas ' stance along with israel 's inflexibility have hindered successful peace negotiations , blair might feel he can succeed if he takes small steps towards his goals .
an economic conference was recently held in the palestinian west bank city of bethlehem .
a conference to support palestinian peace and justice efforts was recently held in berlin .
these small steps and small successes might be tedious , but they are creating confidence , and confidence is something that is missing completely in the middle east .
small steps require a lot of patience , tenacity and perseverance .
blair has already shown he has these qualities and so he will surely stay in the job longer than his predecessor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 report : georgia offers russia deal over separatist abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the alleged offer , georgia would pull its troops into the north of abkhazia in what could prove to be the first breakthrough in the stand-off over its separatist abkhazia region , georgia has made an offer to russia to divide the region into zones of influence , a russian paper claims . according to the russian kommersant broadsheet , georgia also offered to renounce its goal to join nato , a flashpoint topic for the russian administration .
the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .
friday 's report comes as top european union officials were expected to touch on georgia at talks in siberia with russian president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we came here to win the tournament , " cesc fabregas , one of the stars of the night , said .
" in a final anything can happen , but right now we have to enjoy the moment . " fabregas was rushed into action after 34 minutes after a muscle injury to david villa , who is now a major doubt for the final , and the arsenal man said he would play any part he is asked to against germany . " it 's up to the boss but i will be here as soon as he needs me , " said fabregas . russia could n't keep up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia just got tired too soon , said their coach russia had stunned holland in the previous round , with andrei arshavin at the center of all their best moves , but he and the entire russian side were well short of their best in the ernst happel stadium this time around . " arshavin plays very freely so we decided that in every area one player was meant to keep an eye on him .
if -lsb- marcos -rsb- senna left him then another player took up the job , " said aragones of how spain snuffed out the threat from the zenit st. petersburg star . " we lost against a very good opponent .
spain is a very good team , " admitted russia coach guus hiddink .
" we were able to keep to their level for nearly an hour .
that was their plan to make us tired and we could not keep with them in the second half . " but we can be proud to have gotten to this stage . " spain cashes in during second half in steady rain , spain , who had squeezed past italy on penalties in the quarter-finals , dominated possession in a frenetic opening and villa and fernando torres caused the russia defense all sorts of problems . the only surprise was that it took as long as 50 minutes for spain to go ahead , and xavi side-footed them in front after a cross-shot from andres iniesta . guiza and xabi alonso replaced xavi and torres and spain went further ahead 17 minutes from time , a lovely lofted pass from fabregas setting up guiza , who finished neatly . fabregas was the provider once again , eight minutes from the end , slotting the ball perfectly into the path of silva , who found the corner with a fine left-foot finish . arshavin almost pulled one back late on but iker casillas saved well and spain ran out convincing winners . spain reluctant favorites against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain may be favored , but they have less experience in the finals than germany " we started the game playing the kind of football russia likes with longer balls but when we started moving the ball around that is when we started doing well , both defensively and offensively , " said aragones . " we passed the ball very well .
when we came to the tournament we realized that we had a good team and could get very far .
we have learned how to compete . " arogones refused to accept his side would now start as favorites against germany , despite joachim loew 's side having had an inconsistent tournament to date . " i do n't know if there is a favorite .
maybe germany can be considered favorites because they are more used to getting to finals than we are , " said aragones of the three-time winners . " but it 's very difficult to stop us when we move the ball very quickly .
the russians got tired .
the germans might be better physically but in the end our pace could tire them , " he added . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.06.2008 report : georgia offers russia deal over separatist abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the alleged offer , georgia would pull its troops into the north of abkhazia in what could prove to be the first breakthrough in the stand-off over its separatist abkhazia region , georgia has made an offer to russia to divide the region into zones of influence , a russian paper claims . according to the russian kommersant broadsheet , georgia also offered to renounce its goal to join nato , a flashpoint topic for the russian administration .
the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .
however , the report claims that russia would keep its peacekeepers in the russian zone of influence and would expect georgia to allow russian investors free rein in abkhazia .
dropping nato ambitions a major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili had made nato membership a strategic objective the most striking claim is that georgia would drop its nato membership goals as part of the deal . this would be a major concession by president mikhail saakashvili , who has made joining the alliance a strategic objective and received us support .
" for russia the reward for its help would be georgia 's renunciation of its plans to join nato , ” the newspaper said .
" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .
we 've formulated our position very clearly : autonomous status within georgia in no way suits us , " bagapsh told the newspaper .
tensions over abkhazia have spiraled in recent months following russia 's establishment of formal ties with the separatists , in part inspired by western recognition of kosovo .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

gazprom controls a quarter of the world 's gas reserves . gazprom plans to increase its presence in europe 's gas retail business , the company 's chief executive announced on friday , june 27 .
currently , few cars in europe run on natural gas , in part because there are few places to tank up .
" we are proposing to our european partners the creation of a network of natural gas stations in europe with the participation of gazprom , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told a shareholders ' meeting in moscow on friday , june 27 .
natural gas is seen as cheaper and more environmentally friendly than regular fuel .
while the idea has yet to catch on in europe , natural gas is widely used in cars in argentina , brazil , india , iran and pakistan .
for the moment , miller said he does n't see any " realistic alternatives " to hydrocarbons .
he also panned biofuel , which he blamed for leading to a global food crisis . gazprom eyes liquid gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas cars are relatively rare in europe gazprom supplies a quarter of europe 's gas .
it is also aggressively moving into the liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- market .
gazprom wants to control 20 or 25 percent of the lng market in the upcoming years , valery golubev , gazprom 's deputy chief executive said on friday .
russia 's first lng project on the far eastern island of sakhalin is due to start production later this year .
gazprom 's large shtokman field in northern russia is due to come online in 2014 , executives said .
banking on government support miller sees a rosy future for gazprom .
its strong ties to the government give it a huge growth potential and it aims to become the world 's energy leader , the ceo said friday .
russian president dmitry medvedev , who took office last month , previously served as chairman of the state-controlled gas giant .
gazprom announced friday that medvedev 's replacement as chairman will be former prime minister viktor zubkov . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .

the offer , detailed in the report which cited unnamed officials in the russian foreign ministry and in georgia 's leadership , came after abkhaz separatist chief sergei bagapsh held talks in moscow on thursday .
in the report , it is claimed that georgia would extend its control further north into abkhazia , as far as the kodori river , and would provide a haven there for georgian refugees who fled fighting in the region in the 1990s .
under tbilisi 's proposal , the whole of abkhazia would remain part of georgia but with wide autonomy , kommersant reported .
in return , russia would also formally renounce a cooperation agreement with the separatists that was reached in april .

" all participants ... would achieve their goals and save face .
georgian president saakashvili could joyfully declare the return of abkhazia to the bosom of the country while the abkhaz side , losing control of an insignificant part of the territory , would guarantee itself de facto independence . "
abkhazia is recognized as part of georgia but it is run by separatists with support from moscow .
friction between the ex-soviet neighbors over the region has alarmed western states worried about a conflagration near a vital oil export route .
the report stated , however , that abkhaz chief bagapsh was dissatisfied with the alleged proposals .
" there are no new proposals here .
all this is old .

images of the documents are gradually being sent to washington and jerusalem .
shapiro , who is chief historian at the us national holocaust museum in washington , dc was in bad arolsen on thursday , june 26 .
" nobody can even begin to imagine the scope of the documents stored here , " shapiro said .
millions of pages made public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive also contains personal belongings it was clear that the evidence in the papers would trigger new debate " and alter our picture of the holocaust , " he said .
the information would reinforce past verdicts , but also offer new details of german officials ' mentality and of life in concentration camps , said shapiro , who is in charge of the first party of scholars to begin detailed research in the papers .
several buildings maintained by the red cross international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- at bad arolsen contain more than 50 million pages of data covering the fates of 17.5 million non-germans .
they were caught up in the war or its aftermath as camp inmates , forced laborers and displaced persons .

the henley by-election will be the cause of a lot of furrowed brows this morning , both at labour party headquarters and in 10 downing street .
labour would never have expected to win , or come second in this safe tory seat .
they managed third at the last general election , but at least that was behind the conservatives and the lib dems .
trailing behind two minority parties and to fail to manage even the 1,700 or so votes which would have saved candidate richard mckenzie 's deposit will hurt .
a lot .
gordon brown insisted there would be no special events to mark his first year in charge .
henley makes that look like a very wise decision indeed .
bruising campaign for the liberal democrats , henley provided good and not so good news .
on the one hand , candidate stephen kearney maintained the party share of the vote which , given what happened to labour , might seem like no mean feat . "
henley had the potential to be tricky for the tories ; instead , it has provided another raft of gruesome headlines for gordon brown " on the other , the party spent a lot of time and effort in the seat - some strategists viewed this as being more important than crewe and nantwich - and yet they failed to make a dent in the tory majority .
the lib dems fought a typically bruising campaign where they were accused of playing the man and not the ball .
senior figures within the party 's cowley street headquarters may be wondering if they got their tactics right .
the big worry for the conservatives was whether , after a high profile , larger-than-life character like boris johnson , the more low-key john howell would prove attractive enough to persuade the voters of henley to turn out for him .
they need n't have worried .
mr howell 's victory was as comprehensive as any tory could have hoped for .
the local boy done good - so much so , that those opposed to david cameron 's a list may use his performance as evidence that white , middle-aged , middle-class men still have what it takes to steer the party on its path of power .
henley had the potential to be tricky for the tories ; instead , it has provided another raft of gruesome headlines for gordon brown .
one year in , things are very definitely not getting better for the prime minister .

euro 2008 has been a success off and on the pitch but two of soccer 's ruling powers , world body fifa and europe 's uefa , are concerned about upcoming tournaments . fifa president joseph blatter and his uefa counterpart michel platini are men with common goals in soccer .
but they also share common concerns as their two most important projects of the next few years - the 2010 world cup in south africa and euro 2012 in ukraine and poland - continue to make the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the view from euro 2008 in switzerland and austria is far from rosy .
in view of their otherwise highly professional way of working it is curious that world governing body fifa and its european counterpart uefa have caused themselves problems with a tournament award favored by the president -lrb- south africa -rrb- and one that was a complete surprise -lrb- ukraine / poland -rrb- .
this is even more so in view of the fact that the tournaments are their most important sources of income .
pressure from sponsors who fear the loss of one of their most lucrative advertising platforms is almost bound to occur .
hosts defend against onslaught of rumors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blatter -lrb- right -rrb- and platini are concerned statements from federation officials from the criticized host countries sound at present like self-comforting set phrases .
irvin khoza , world cup organizing committee chairman , said at a podium discussion in vienna the concerns were being noted but that south africa has a good security concept and would be ready on time .
similar soothing statements are coming from poland and ukraine .
a uefa inspection next week is " no cause for concern , " ukraine tournament organizer evhen chervonenko said .
the signals from the uefa administration are different .
it is no longer completely ruled that an ultimatum by platini to the eastern europeans in january is more than just a warning shot .
spain has long been unofficially considered as a substitute .
a uefa meeting is set for friday while platini and his personnel have agreed not to say anything on the issue until after the current euro 2008 tournament .
afterwards , the euro 2012 hosts have to come up with a solution to serious infrastructure problems concerning stadium construction , transport routes and hotel capacity .
beckenbauer supports south africa the south africans , meanwhile , have been fighting virtually from the may 2004 award of the 2010 world cup to dispel rumors that they could lose the tournament .
a dozen countries have been mentioned as possible replacements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said soccer brings people together germany , the 2006 world cup host , is one of them , but franz beckenbauer , president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , has issued a categorical rejection .
" the world cup in south africa has to be a success , " the fifa executive committee member wrote in a brochure published by the world cup organizing committee .
" everyone knows that africa has many problems like poverty , war , crime and poor health care .
i believe that only football can bring people together and inspire them to dreams and hopes . "
despite the wave of violence against african foreigners in cape town a few weeks ago , it appears that finding a new host can be ruled out .
blatter has made the first football world cup on african soil such a personal prestige object that there is no going back .
the biggest organizational problems such as stadium construction do indeed now seem to have been solved .
what remains are the concerns for the safety of the expected 450,000 world cup tourists as crime apparently spirals out of control .
however , danny jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 world cup organizing committee , insisted south africa would be ready and able to host a safe world cup .
" south africa has a track record of hosting big events - 11 in the past 14 years - without a single incident .
these were safe and we will ensure that the world cup is no different , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few believe his labour party has a real chance of winning the next general election in 2010 . gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister was marked by a humiliating loss on friday , june 27 , in a mid-term election for a vacant parliamentary seat in the affluent town of henley-on-thames near london .
labour 's candidate garnered just 3.1 percent of votes cast and took fifth place , behind the greens and the far-right bnp .
the conservative tory candidate won the seat with an increased 57 percent share of votes cast .
the drubbing comes weeks after a narrow win by brown on controversial measures allowing terror suspects to be held for 42 days without charge .
the vote , regarded as a test of brown 's flagging leadership , has been called a " humiliating victory " with the premier facing a rebellion in his own ranks and relying on nine democratic unionist mps from northern ireland to win the vote in the house of commons .
rapid downfall " gordon brown is like a brand that simply does n't work anymore , " said nick sparrow from the market research firm icm .
" there are politicians who survive tough times and recover .
but in the face of the most recent opinion polls it 's difficult to imagine how brown can survive politically . "
few had counted on brown , blair 's former finance minster , stumbling so badly and so rapidly since taking office .
at the time , in june 2007 , approval ratings for labour were at 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most british voters perfer david cameron to brown but they 've been in free fall ever since brown opted against calling a snap general election last october .
opinion polls show labour struggling 20 percentage points behind the conservatives , who would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held right now .
some 49 percent say their opinion of brown has worsened from a year ago while 46 percent believe the youthful looking david cameron , the tories ' leader , would make the " best prime minister . "
until a year ago , gordon brown was widely respected for his expertise on the economy .
he was considered competent , careful and thorough - not a showman like tony blair .
but brown has since suffered from growing malaise over an economic slowdown and fears of a housing market crash . the prime minister has been nicknamed " gordon clown " and is a favorite target on satirical tv shows .
a brief honeymoon things started off well for brown - he steered the country through bungled terrorist attacks in glasgow and london , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and devastating floods last year .
brown later dubbed the period his " baptism of fire and water . "
brown 's supporters predicted a snap autumn election and his party even began spending in preparation .
but as his party fanned rumors of an early vote , brown backed down just as his opinion poll ratings faltered .
" that was the turning point , " said francis beckett , author of a biography of brown .
for weeks , brown left the public in the dark about his intentions and finally , the snap polls did n't take place .
brown denied the reason for it were bad approval ratings .
but his rivals seized on the decision to portray him as a weak , fearful and indecisive premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines of anxious investors wait to withdraw their savings outside a branch of northern rock in london funding scandals and a string of government blunders further dented brown 's credibility .
almost immediately , the global credit crunch began to bite , plunging british mortgage lender northern rock to the brink of collapse and triggering the first run on a british bank since 1866 .
the affair further punctured confidence in the brown government .
" it 's all about the economy " " gordon brown has lost touch with the population , worse , he betrayed the most needy , " said nick clegg , head of the liberal democrats , referring to another fiasco when brown scrapped the lowest tax rate - effectively raising income taxes on the country 's poorest sections .
that decision sparked a rebellion in labour 's ranks , forcing brown to retreat reverse the tax cut .
the turmoil cost labour dearly in local elections in may - they came up with their worst result in four decades .
skyrocketing food and oil prices have compounded brown 's woes .
but nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party said that though global disasters played a role in brown 's troubles , the british population was justifiably angry because the government was so unprepared as it hurtled into the current situation .
there are two years to go until the next general elections .
and few doubt a new prime minister could revive the party 's sagging fortunes .
" it 's a truism - but finally it 's all about the economy , " said nick sparrow .
" and if the economy is n't working then you inevitably blame the government . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece got the most money from the bloc , according to a report released on friday , june 27 . boosting economic growth and jobs is the single most expensive part of the eu budget , surpassing cash handouts to farmers , according to figures presented by the european commission .
germany made the largest net contribution to the bloc 's budget , paying in 7.4 billion euros more than it received back from the eu .
germany has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor , paying in just over 70 billion euros over the last decade .
but in 2007 , britain overtook the netherlands and france to become the eu 's second-highest net contributor , paying out 4.2 billion euros more than it received - despite having a 5.2-billion-euro rebate .
france dropped to third place , paying in 3 billion euros compared with the dutch sum of 2.9 billion .
greece gets most at the other end of the spectrum , greece received 5.4 billion euros more from the eu budget than it paid in , making it the eu 's biggest recipient for the second year running .
eu newcomer poland , by far the largest and now the poorest in per capita terms of the countries which joined the eu in 2004 , came in second , receiving 5.1 billion euros more than it paid in .
and spain , which was the eu 's largest recipient of net payments from 1998 to 2005 , making a profit over the period of a massive 59.6 billion euros , came in third in 2007 , netting 3.6 billion euros .
rural , costal areas profit the eu 's budget is the subject of fierce wrangling every year as member states jostle to get more money from the common fund .
the most famous row of all came in 1984 , when britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher proclaimed , " i want my money back ! " and threatened to stop britain 's eu payments unless she received a rebate .
that dispute was based on the immense sums paid to european farmers out of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which at that time took around two-thirds of the total budget , and from which britain received relatively little .
but friday 's figures showed that eu spending was no longer so dominated by the cap .
according to officials , the 27-member union spent 44 billion euros on employment and economic programs in 2007 .
that figure is 3.7 per cent more than in 2006 , and tops the 43 billion euros paid out to farmers , making 2007 the first year in which growth and employment projects were the single biggest category of eu funding recipients .
however , the eu also paid out 12 billion euros on rural development , fisheries and environmental protection - meaning that close on half its budget was still spent in supporting rural and coastal areas .
among the eu 's members , france received over 10 billion euros for farming and rural development - almost 50 per cent more than any other eu country .
britain received 4.2 billion euros , while poland received 3.1 billion . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even in defeat - her face contorted in frustration and despair - she dominates the front of the daily mail , the times , the guardian and the daily telegraph .
the times says her winning opponent was motivated by a hatred of her provocative tuxedo and shorts outfit .
she may be " in fashion , " but she 's " out of wimbledon " , says the guardian .
brown advice labour 's poor performance in the henley by-election , where it ranked fifth , is dubbed by the independent as " disastrous " for gordon brown .
it asked a range of experts what he can do to recover .
a public relations expert suggests " a charisma implant " .
a fashion designer says " he 'd be better off getting kicked out for trying to do what he believed was right " .
the telegraph doubts there is a remedy , saying " no leader has clawed his way back from such low ratings " .
green 's the thing the government 's call for a " green revolution " is noted by few papers .
but there is a round of applause from the guardian , which says the government " has at last got serious " about the need to switch to greener energy sources .
the daily mirror judges the plans " a power for good " , but is worried that cleaner energy will cost more .
a sceptical daily mail asks whether wind-power is practical , affordable and reliable .
the government wind farm plan will cost families £ 260 a year , it says .
size matters size is n't everything but when it comes to kiwi fruit , millimetres matter .
that at least is the europe-wide rule which , as the mail reports , has determined that a market trader in bristol can not sell 5,000 kiwis imported from chile - because they are all one millimetre smaller than the standard authorised size .
the trader , tim down , complains in the telegraph that he can not even give the kiwis away .
the daily express demands to know why we are enforcing regulations which embarrass even officials in brussels .

even in defeat - her face contorted in frustration and despair - she dominates the front of the daily mail , the times , the guardian and the daily telegraph .

that at least is the europe-wide rule which , as the mail reports , has determined that a market trader in bristol can not sell 5,000 kiwis imported from chile - because they are all one millimetre smaller than the standard authorised size .
the trader , tim down , complains in the telegraph that he can not even give the kiwis away .
the daily express demands to know why we are enforcing regulations which embarrass even officials in brussels .

some in gwynedd , powys and ceredigion claimed the media and professionals in different agencies also fostered negative attitudes .
one recommendation made by the report includes the introduction of a national mental health awareness programme .
the study 's findings was discussed at a conference in aberystwyth .
mind cymru was commissioned to conduct the study by the big lottery fund as part of its more than a number campaign to raise awareness about mental health issues in wales .
the study aimed to identify the barriers experienced by 18-40-year-olds and looked at the potential for encouraging community health organisations to support the mental health and well-being of young patients .
the research was conducted between july and september 2007 and found a lack of mental health promotion at all levels including schools , employers , further education and gp practices . "
i have experienced stigma through intolerance and ignorance and in rural wales there is a lack of information about what services are out there " research participant as part of the study respondents also identified some of the barriers to accessing mental health services .
stigma caused the most concern and a lack of correct information about mental distress was highlighted as a significant factor .
the research found there was a reluctance to go to the gp for support particularly in smaller communities .
one respondent was concerned they knew medical centre staff and were fearful of news travelling around their village through gossip .
some respondents indicated that families are often reluctant to accept that a family member was suffering from mental distress , further compounding the problems of sufferers .
some of the other barriers cited included short term funding for local voluntary sector mental health projects , poor communication between the agencies that have a role in providing support and the isolation that often results from living in a rural area .
this isolation is compounded by poor local transport links , and it was indicated that mental health promotion and education should begin in schools .
highlighting the barriers faced on a day-to-day basis , one young person who participated in the research , said : " mental distress is something that is going to be present for my entire life .
' intolerance and ignorance ' " i have experienced stigma through intolerance and ignorance and in rural wales there is a lack of information about what services are out there - you have to go looking for it .
" the area is not good for mental health services as there are limited choices because of limited resources and so many needing them .
" young people 's problems are not seen as serious as adults with family stresses .
young people do not acknowledge they have a problem - they do n't realise it !
" there is not enough mental health awareness in schools .
i did n't know i had depression until i left school .
most of the time you can feel like you are suffering on your own . "
the six recommendations made by the report included a review of advocacy arrangements for young people and following up on those organisations which wanted to become involved in mental health work .
ruth coombs of mind cymru said one of the most promising findings of the research was that 95 % of the non mental health organisations consulted wanted to become more involved in well being in rural wales .
" this confirms our position that mental health and well being is everybody 's business , " she said .
barbara wilding from the big lottery fund said she hoped the research would promote discussion about mental health provision for young people in rural wales .

the study 's findings was discussed at a conference in aberystwyth .
mind cymru was commissioned to conduct the study by the big lottery fund as part of its more than a number campaign to raise awareness about mental health issues in wales .
the study aimed to identify the barriers experienced by 18-40-year-olds and looked at the potential for encouraging community health organisations to support the mental health and well-being of young patients .

stigma caused the most concern and a lack of correct information about mental distress was highlighted as a significant factor .
the research found there was a reluctance to go to the gp for support particularly in smaller communities .
one respondent was concerned they knew medical centre staff and were fearful of news travelling around their village through gossip .
some respondents indicated that families are often reluctant to accept that a family member was suffering from mental distress , further compounding the problems of sufferers .
some of the other barriers cited included short term funding for local voluntary sector mental health projects , poor communication between the agencies that have a role in providing support and the isolation that often results from living in a rural area .
this isolation is compounded by poor local transport links , and it was indicated that mental health promotion and education should begin in schools .

its board said the offer undervalued the company , but added that it was open to consider any proposals that would provide full value to its shareholders .
anheuser-busch 's board said the offer also failed to take into account its " blue ocean " cost-cutting initiative .
but the company 's shares still traded well below the $ 65 a share offered .
they closed in new york at $ 61.35 and rose to $ 61.90 in after-hours trading after the bid was rejected .
inbev is the world 's second largest brewer , with brands such as stella artois and beck 's , and if the takeover were to be successful it would take over the number one spot from sab miller .
there was manoeuvring by inbev during the day that suggested it might be prepared to attempt to bypass anheuser-busch 's board .
the company filed a case in a delaware court to confirm the ability of shareholders to remove the current directors .

its board said the offer undervalued the company , but added that it was open to consider any proposals that would provide full value to its shareholders .
anheuser-busch 's board said the offer also failed to take into account its " blue ocean " cost-cutting initiative .
but the company 's shares still traded well below the $ 65 a share offered .
they closed in new york at $ 61.35 and rose to $ 61.90 in after-hours trading after the bid was rejected .
inbev is the world 's second largest brewer , with brands such as stella artois and beck 's , and if the takeover were to be successful it would take over the number one spot from sab miller .
there was manoeuvring by inbev during the day that suggested it might be prepared to attempt to bypass anheuser-busch 's board .
the company filed a case in a delaware court to confirm the ability of shareholders to remove the current directors .

anglian water said the technology was a well-known cure for the cryptosporidium parasite affecting supplies to 250,000 of its customers in the county .
the firm is still advising residents of daventry , northampton and nearby villages to boil water for drinking and food preparation .
schools which closed in the aftermath of the contamination have now reopened .
experts are still trying to identify how the parasite , which causes severe stomach upsets , got into the supply .
the main focus of inquiry is the pitsford water treatment works , which serves the main water reservoir in the part of northamptonshire affected by the cryptosporidium contamination .
an anglian water spokeswoman said : " scientists are working around the clock to find the source of the problem and are investigating , in minute detail , the pitsford water treatment works . "
bottled water has been delivered to schools , hospitals and care homes the spokeswoman said : " we have brought in three ultra violet units and this is a well known technology for rendering cryptosporidium harmless .
" these units are being installed today .
meanwhile our advice is still to boil and then cool any water to be used for drinking or food preparation .
" we are advising that the bottles delivered to school are taken home by pupils and filled with cooled water from the tap that has been boiled .
if it is kept in the fridge overnight children will have water for the next day .
" but we are delivering about 37,500 bottles of water to schools , hospitals and care homes every working day as long as the situation lasts , although this will be less at weekends as schools are closed , " she said .
anglian water has apologised for the inconvenience and has written to gps and hospitals asking them to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of cryptosporidiosis .
symptoms include diarrhoea , stomach pains , dehydration , weight loss and fever .
the illness can be more serious in people with weak immune systems such as the elderly or very young .
anglian water advises customers with worries about their health to contact their gp or call nhs direct on 0845 4647 .

have you been told to boil your water ?
or has your child 's school been closed as a result of this bug ?

the bumblebee conservation trust -lrb- bct -rrb- said it was a behaviour that appeared to be becoming increasingly common .
images captured by the bbc scotland news website in a garden in nairn , in the highlands , show the bees visiting tree leaves covered with aphids .
the secretions offer a substitute for nectar , but do not contain the protein the insects need to stay healthy .
there have been warnings that bumblebee and wild bee populations around the uk are experiencing " catastrophic declines " .
bees are important pollinators of flowers and crops .
the bumblebees ' behaviour of feeding on secretions from aphids could be a further sign of the problems facing the insects . "
there is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees " craig macadam buglife scottish officer dr ben darvill , a bct director and research ecologist based at the university of stirling , said there have been several reports of the behaviour but the reason for it remained unclear .
he said : " it 's hard to say for sure , but it does seem as if this behaviour is becoming more common .
" bumblebees are known to feed from aphid secretions , and from extra-floral nectaries on unlikely plants like bracken - but it 's more usual to see it in upland areas where there are few other flowers around .
" the fact that it is now frequently observed elsewhere may suggest that there are fewer of the right sorts of flowers around in people 's gardens and in the wider countryside . "
dr darvill said a fascinating aspect of the behaviour was the bumblebees ' ability to apparently smell the sugar .
they normally choose flowers by colour , but are known to have " smelly feet " allowing them to detect if a flower has already been visited by another bumblebee for its pollen .
however , the intrigue is tinged with concern for the insects .
dr darvill said : " bumblebees have struggled in recent decades from habitat loss - three species are extinct in the uk and many more are threatened - so perhaps bumblebees are having to find innovative ways of finding food . "
but he added : " although the aphid secretions provide them with a sugary solution , a substitute for nectar , they provide no protein .
" bumblebees can only get their protein from pollen , which they feed to their growing young , so it is essential for a healthy population . "
research work at the university of stirling , has demonstrated that certain pollens are particularly rich in protein , said dr darvill .
he said to help declining bumblebees , gardeners , farmers and land managers need to ensure a constant supply of forage plants from march through until september .
flowers from the pea and mint families seem to be particularly beneficial .
craig macadam , scottish officer with conservation group buglife , said aphids were considered a garden pest but he would not wish to see them wiped out .
he said : " ants often protect the aphids from other predators such as ladybirds and in return they take the honey dew secreted by the aphids .
" there is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees . "

the bumblebee conservation trust -lrb- bct -rrb- said it was a behaviour that appeared to be becoming increasingly common .
images captured by the bbc scotland news website in a garden in nairn , in the highlands , show the bees visiting tree leaves covered with aphids .
the secretions offer a substitute for nectar , but do not contain the protein the insects need to stay healthy .
there have been warnings that bumblebee and wild bee populations around the uk are experiencing " catastrophic declines " .
bees are important pollinators of flowers and crops .
the bumblebees ' behaviour of feeding on secretions from aphids could be a further sign of the problems facing the insects .
there is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees craig macadam buglife scottish officer dr ben darvill , a bct director and research ecologist based at the university of stirling , said there have been several reports of the behaviour but the reason for it remained unclear .
he said : " it 's hard to say for sure , but it does seem as if this behaviour is becoming more common .
" bumblebees are known to feed from aphid secretions , and from extra-floral nectaries on unlikely plants like bracken - but it 's more usual to see it in upland areas where there are few other flowers around .
" the fact that it is now frequently observed elsewhere may suggest that there are fewer of the right sorts of flowers around in people 's gardens and in the wider countryside . "
dr darvill said a fascinating aspect of the behaviour was the bumblebees ' ability to apparently smell the sugar .
they normally choose flowers by colour , but are known to have " smelly feet " allowing them to detect if a flower has already been visited by another bumblebee for its pollen .
however , the intrigue is tinged with concern for the insects .
dr darvill said : " bumblebees have struggled in recent decades from habitat loss - three species are extinct in the uk and many more are threatened - so perhaps bumblebees are having to find innovative ways of finding food . "
a wasp at the same curled up leaf frequented by bumblebees but he added : " although the aphid secretions provide them with a sugary solution , a substitute for nectar , they provide no protein .
" bumblebees can only get their protein from pollen , which they feed to their growing young , so it is essential for a healthy population . "
research work at the university of stirling , has demonstrated that certain pollens are particularly rich in protein , said dr darvill .
he said to help declining bumblebees , gardeners , farmers and land managers need to ensure a constant supply of forage plants from march through until september .
flowers from the pea and mint families seem to be particularly beneficial .
craig macadam , scottish officer with conservation group buglife , said aphids were considered a garden pest but he would not wish to see them wiped out .
he said : " ants often protect the aphids from other predators such as ladybirds and in return they take the honey dew secreted by the aphids .
" there is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees . "
