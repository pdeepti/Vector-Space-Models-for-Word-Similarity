program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .

while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .
the bretton woods agreement was formally signed on dec .

steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .

an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .

the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .

" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .

" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .

she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .

we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2008 leverkusen go top after beating schalke ; bayern stumble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick helmes continued his run of form by hitting one of the goals which beat schalke bayer leverkusen downed schalke 2-1 to stay top of the bundesliga on saturday , while bayern munich lost ground after conceding two late goals in a 2-2 draw at borussia moenchengladbach . hoffenheim meanwhile stayed second , level on 28 points with leverkusen but with a slightly inferior goal difference after edging wolfsburg 3-2 .
bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .

dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

" the biggest problem is the export of fascism and extremism from hungarian territory to slovakia , " fico said at a press conference televised on the ta3 news channel .
he urged his counterpart to crack down on hungary 's neo-nazis , who have contributed to escalating tensions in recent weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .

missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .

like others in the industry , the german carmaker has been forced to temporarily close factories to cut costs . " we are looking into it to see whether it 's appropriate , " steinbrueck said friday , nov .
14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .

opel , which employs 25,700 workers , and other german carmakers , such as daimler and bmw , have announced temporary closures of factories to cut costs after a huge drop in orders . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .

philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .

like others in the industry , the german carmaker has been forced to temporarily close factories to cut costs . " we are looking into it to see whether it 's appropriate , " steinbrueck said friday , nov .
14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .
general motors , the world 's biggest carmaker , is struggling to stay afloat because of a massive slump in sales triggered by the ongoing financial crisis .
opel , which employs 25,700 workers , and other german carmakers , such as daimler and bmw , have announced temporary closures of factories to cut costs after a huge drop in orders . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .

nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "
" i do n't want to spend my life doing mega-projects or big pharaonic works , " he insists . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .

the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .

the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .

the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "

he advocated greater minority representation in french politics . malek boutih told delegates at the french socialist party convention on friday , nov .
14 , that the " time for waiting is over . "
the election of the first us black president is the " change we 've been waiting for , " he added .
boutih was born in france to algerian parents and , as the former head of the advocacy group sos racism , is known as an anti-racism campaigner .
though france has the largest muslim minority and one of the largest black populations in europe , its political scene remains largely white .
there are two women of north african descent and one black human rights minister in president nicolas sarkozy 's government , but only one black parliamentarian from mainland france , socialist george pau-langevin , who was elected last year .
boutih ran for a parliamentary seat , but lost when a rival from within his socialist party refused to accept his nomination and ran against him on an independent ticket .
" the experience that i have had with the party leadership has taught me that it is difficult to advance , " said boutih , as reported by afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's 2007 presidential campaign made her unpopular with some in her own party boutih 's comments come as france 's opposition socialists hold a party congress amid divisions over future leadership and reform plans .
royal confirms candidacy a year and a half after losing the presidential election to conservative sarkozy , segolene royal announced friday her official candidacy to chair the socialist party .
her decision came after her manifesto for party renewal was affirmed this week with a 30 percent vote from party members .
however , she faces competition from several other candidates , including paris mayor bertrand delanoe , who picked up 25 percent of the party membership vote .
royal does not have an immigrant background , but if she is selected at the three-day convention in reims , the capital of the champagne region , she would be the first woman to head the party . as sarkozy advocated tighter financial regulation - a stance typically represented by the socialists - at the emergency group of twenty summit in washington , the socialists outgoing leader francois hollande friday urged party members to unity .
" there will be no victory in 2012 without a strong and united socialist party , so let 's unite , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .
the bretton woods agreement was formally signed on dec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .

germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .

the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .

" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .

" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .

the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

15 , called for cooperation after their meeting in the border town of komarno , they mostly engaged in a stinging exchange that did more to highlight their disagreements than signal a quick way out of the crisis .
" the biggest problem is the export of fascism and extremism from hungarian territory to slovakia , " fico said at a press conference televised on the ta3 news channel .
he urged his counterpart to crack down on hungary 's neo-nazis , who have contributed to escalating tensions in recent weeks .
" it is unacceptable for us ... that 28 people dressed in hungarian fascist uniforms cross the border and march through a slovak town , " fico said referring to a recent incident .
accusations of nationalism speaking through an interpreter , gyurcsany countered that slovak politics " are not merely flirting with nationalism , but are engaged to it " and urged fico to fight extremists in his own government .
relations between the two neighbours have deteriorated since the summer of 2006 when fico formed a three-party government , which includes the slovak national party , led by jan slota .
the controversial slovak politician has repeatedly attacked hungary .
the tensions have escalated in recent weeks , owing to a string of extremist acts on both sides of the border .
slota recently insulted hungarian foreign minister kinga goncz , likening her to adolf hitler , while hungarian right-wing extremists have protested over territorial claims in slovakia , once part of hungary . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , called for cooperation after their meeting in the border town of komarno , they mostly engaged in a stinging exchange that did more to highlight their disagreements than signal a quick way out of the crisis .
" the biggest problem is the export of fascism and extremism from hungarian territory to slovakia , " fico said at a press conference televised on the ta3 news channel .
he urged his counterpart to crack down on hungary 's neo-nazis , who have contributed to escalating tensions in recent weeks .
" it is unacceptable for us ... that 28 people dressed in hungarian fascist uniforms cross the border and march through a slovak town , " fico said referring to a recent incident .
accusations of nationalism speaking through an interpreter , gyurcsany countered that slovak politics " are not merely flirting with nationalism , but are engaged to it " and urged fico to fight extremists in his own government .
relations between the two neighbours have deteriorated since the summer of 2006 when fico formed a three-party government , which includes the slovak national party , led by jan slota .
the controversial slovak politician has repeatedly attacked hungary .
the tensions have escalated in recent weeks , owing to a string of extremist acts on both sides of the border .

world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .

he advocated greater minority representation in french politics . malek boutih told delegates at the french socialist party convention on friday , nov .
14 , that the " time for waiting is over . "
the election of the first us black president is the " change we 've been waiting for , " he added .
boutih was born in france to algerian parents and , as the former head of the advocacy group sos racism , is known as an anti-racism campaigner .
though france has the largest muslim minority and one of the largest black populations in europe , its political scene remains largely white .
there are two women of north african descent and one black human rights minister in president nicolas sarkozy 's government , but only one black parliamentarian from mainland france , socialist george pau-langevin , who was elected last year .
boutih ran for a parliamentary seat , but lost when a rival from within his socialist party refused to accept his nomination and ran against him on an independent ticket .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's 2007 presidential campaign made her unpopular with some in her own party boutih 's comments come as france 's opposition socialists hold a party congress amid divisions over future leadership and reform plans .
royal confirms candidacy a year and a half after losing the presidential election to conservative sarkozy , segolene royal announced friday her official candidacy to chair the socialist party .
her decision came after her manifesto for party renewal was affirmed this week with a 30 percent vote from party members .
however , she faces competition from several other candidates , including paris mayor bertrand delanoe , who picked up 25 percent of the party membership vote .
royal does not have an immigrant background , but if she is selected at the three-day convention in reims , the capital of the champagne region , she would be the first woman to head the party . as sarkozy advocated tighter financial regulation - a stance typically represented by the socialists - at the emergency group of twenty summit in washington , the socialists outgoing leader francois hollande friday urged party members to unity .
" there will be no victory in 2012 without a strong and united socialist party , so let 's unite , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .
the bretton woods agreement was formally signed on dec .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

like others in the industry , the german carmaker has been forced to temporarily close factories to cut costs . " we are looking into it to see whether it 's appropriate , " steinbrueck said friday , nov .
14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .
general motors , the world 's biggest carmaker , is struggling to stay afloat because of a massive slump in sales triggered by the ongoing financial crisis .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.11.2008 value of art questioned as un unveils masterpiece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelo , pictured , has been compared to miro and picasso spanish artist miquel barcelo is preparing to unveil one of his most important works so far at the united nations headquarters in geneva while still at the height of his artistic glory . only a political squabble over the cost of the art work has been able to cast a shadow over the significance of barcelo 's piece , the opening ceremony for which will be attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon , spain 's king juan carlos and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on tuesday , nov .
18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "
" i do n't want to spend my life doing mega-projects or big pharaonic works , " he insists . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.11.2008 value of art questioned as un unveils masterpiece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelo , pictured , has been compared to miro and picasso spanish artist miquel barcelo is preparing to unveil one of his most important works so far at the united nations headquarters in geneva while still at the height of his artistic glory . only a political squabble over the cost of the art work has been able to cast a shadow over the significance of barcelo 's piece , the opening ceremony for which will be attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon , spain 's king juan carlos and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on tuesday , nov .
18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "

barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

15 , called for cooperation after their meeting in the border town of komarno , they mostly engaged in a stinging exchange that did more to highlight their disagreements than signal a quick way out of the crisis .
" the biggest problem is the export of fascism and extremism from hungarian territory to slovakia , " fico said at a press conference televised on the ta3 news channel .
he urged his counterpart to crack down on hungary 's neo-nazis , who have contributed to escalating tensions in recent weeks .
" it is unacceptable for us ... that 28 people dressed in hungarian fascist uniforms cross the border and march through a slovak town , " fico said referring to a recent incident .
accusations of nationalism speaking through an interpreter , gyurcsany countered that slovak politics " are not merely flirting with nationalism , but are engaged to it " and urged fico to fight extremists in his own government .
relations between the two neighbours have deteriorated since the summer of 2006 when fico formed a three-party government , which includes the slovak national party , led by jan slota .
the controversial slovak politician has repeatedly attacked hungary .
the tensions have escalated in recent weeks , owing to a string of extremist acts on both sides of the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .

zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .

" history is repeating itself " in italy , piero terracina said friday , nov .
14 , at a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the notorious racial laws targeting jews , which were approved by the italian cabinet on nov .
15 , 1938 .
" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .
significantly , city authorities in rome have said they would conduct a census of the roma population , but , under hefty pressure from the eu , agreed to cancel plans for mass fingerprinting .
the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .

" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

" history is repeating itself " in italy , piero terracina said friday , nov .
14 , at a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the notorious racial laws targeting jews , which were approved by the italian cabinet on nov .
15 , 1938 .
" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .

steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .

14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .
general motors , the world 's biggest carmaker , is struggling to stay afloat because of a massive slump in sales triggered by the ongoing financial crisis .

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "

barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "

opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .
general motors , the world 's biggest carmaker , is struggling to stay afloat because of a massive slump in sales triggered by the ongoing financial crisis .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .

the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" history is repeating itself " in italy , piero terracina said friday , nov .
14 , at a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the notorious racial laws targeting jews , which were approved by the italian cabinet on nov .
15 , 1938 .
" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .
significantly , city authorities in rome have said they would conduct a census of the roma population , but , under hefty pressure from the eu , agreed to cancel plans for mass fingerprinting .
the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "

barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .

dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "
" i do n't want to spend my life doing mega-projects or big pharaonic works , " he insists . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .
the bretton woods agreement was formally signed on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

bayern were left three points behind in third place after they were hit by two late goals in two minutes at lowly moenchengladbach .
luca toni and franck ribery from the penalty spot had given the defending champions the lead but headers from canadian striker rob friend and us midfielder michael bradley in the 79th and 81st minutes prevented juergen klinsmann 's side from posting a sixth straight win .
hertha berlin came from behind to beat sv hamburg to move fourth on 24 points - four behind leverkusen and hoffenheim - leaving hamburg a point behind in fifth .
borussia dortmund scored three goals in the first half hour as they defeated eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
elsewhere , bottom club energie cottbus defeated karlsruhe 1-0 , while vfb stuttgart and arminia bielefeld finished goalless .
leverkusen got the better of schalke in the day 's top match thanks to goals in the 30th and 41st minutes from stefan kiessling and patrick helmes .
midfielder renato augusto tied schalke defender levan kobiashvili in knots on the left side before crossing for kiessling to convert , and helmes pounced with a sharp left-foot shot to put leverkusen in command .
however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .

that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .

the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .
significantly , city authorities in rome have said they would conduct a census of the roma population , but , under hefty pressure from the eu , agreed to cancel plans for mass fingerprinting .
the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

he advocated greater minority representation in french politics . malek boutih told delegates at the french socialist party convention on friday , nov .
14 , that the " time for waiting is over . "
the election of the first us black president is the " change we 've been waiting for , " he added .
boutih was born in france to algerian parents and , as the former head of the advocacy group sos racism , is known as an anti-racism campaigner .
though france has the largest muslim minority and one of the largest black populations in europe , its political scene remains largely white .
there are two women of north african descent and one black human rights minister in president nicolas sarkozy 's government , but only one black parliamentarian from mainland france , socialist george pau-langevin , who was elected last year .
boutih ran for a parliamentary seat , but lost when a rival from within his socialist party refused to accept his nomination and ran against him on an independent ticket .
" the experience that i have had with the party leadership has taught me that it is difficult to advance , " said boutih , as reported by afp news agency .

royal does not have an immigrant background , but if she is selected at the three-day convention in reims , the capital of the champagne region , she would be the first woman to head the party . as sarkozy advocated tighter financial regulation - a stance typically represented by the socialists - at the emergency group of twenty summit in washington , the socialists outgoing leader francois hollande friday urged party members to unity .

14 , in washington on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit of developed and emerging economies .
opel - a unit of general motors corp , which itself is seeking a us government bailout - said earlier friday that it wanted the loan guarantees from german federal and state governments after a sharp downturn in orders but insisted it did not need cash injections .
the german-based carmaker did not name a sum for the guarantees it wanted , but kurt beck , the prime minister of the western state of rhineland-palatinate , said it was about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
steinbrueck said a meeting between opel representatives and the four states where opel has factories would take place tuesday , adding that the talks were still at an initial stage .
the state government of hesse and rhineland-palatinate have already signalled that they could take part in the loan guarantees .
" no liquidity problems " hans demant , vice president of gm europe , said opel was only requesting credit guarantees .
" at this time , we have no liquidity problems , " he said .
an opel spokesman said the company would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of its parent company deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary was affected .
general motors , the world 's biggest carmaker , is struggling to stay afloat because of a massive slump in sales triggered by the ongoing financial crisis .

however the home side had to survive the last 23 minutes with 10 men after defender gonzalo castro was sent off following a second booking .
schalke striker kevin kuranyi gave the visitors hope with a headed goal in the 85th minute to leave leverkusen hanging on desperately for the points .
the defeat leaves schalke , who were beaten 2-1 at home last week by bayern munich , in eighth , now eight points off the top .
bayern throw away two-goal lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach came back from the dead to draw in moenchengladbach , bayern appeared to be on their way to sixth successive league win thanks after a close-range strike from toni in the 21st minute was followed by a second-half penalty from ribery .
philipp lahm was the creator for toni 's opener after good work down the left , and shortly afterwards the left back had a strong claim for a penalty turned down .
ribery then converted from the spot in the 65th minute when there was little doubt about a foul in the area on the france midfielder by steve gohouri .
however moenchengladbach were lifted by a friend header after bayern were caught napping following a short corner , and bradley again found the net with a header from a roberto colautti cross .
hoffenheim twice took the lead in the first half against wolfsburg through vedad ibisevic - scoring his 14th goal of the season - and carlos eduardo with a direct free-kick .
felix magath 's side responded quickly each time through grafite , with a clever turn and toe-poke , and edin dzeko , but hoffenheim - playing at their temporary home in mannheim - grabbed all the points when chinedu obasi struck a 69th-minute winner .
hamburg slip again as berlin move into fourth a marvelous overhead goal by croatia striker mladen petric gave sv hamburg a 12th-minute lead against hertha berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha roll on into fourth after beating hsv in berlin but martin jol 's side were caught cold after the break when cicero headed hertha level in the 46th minute and valeri domovchiyski swept in a second two minutes later to chalk up a fourth straight home win for hertha .
dortmund defender neven subotik twice found the net with headers - from a corner and free-kick - either side of a tamas hajnal goal on the way to a comfortable victory over frankfurt .
felipe santana headed a fourth from a free-kick in the 69th as juergen klopp 's side picked up only a second home win this season after five draws .

" history is repeating itself " in italy , piero terracina said friday , nov .
14 , at a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the notorious racial laws targeting jews , which were approved by the italian cabinet on nov .
15 , 1938 .
" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .
significantly , city authorities in rome have said they would conduct a census of the roma population , but , under hefty pressure from the eu , agreed to cancel plans for mass fingerprinting .
the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.11.2008 opinion : eu , russia right to make up amid finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite recent disagreements , the eu has handed an olive leaf to moscow by reopening partnership talks .
that 's commendable - just as long as the problems do n't get swept under the rug , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . over the past few weeks , russia has provoked the european union often enough .
first , russia 's response to georgia 's military effort to recapture two separatist provinces was completely excessive .
when french president nicolas sarkozy then tried to negotiation a ceasefire agreement , russia pulled its troops out of georgia proper , but concentrated even more soldiers in south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's also recognized both territories as independent states .
so it 's understandable that the eu called off negotiations over a new partnership treaty out of protest .
the new eu member states in eastern europe , which had suffered under soviet rule themselves , called in particular for a halt to talks .
they wanted to hold russia at bay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach what has the eu achieved with its protest ?
nothing significant in the caucasus issue .
missile threat from moscow then russia 's president medvedev announced that he would set up short-range missiles in the enclave kaliningrad in response to the united states ' plan for a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
even if that does n't have anything to do with the european union directly , russia showed once again that it responds in a big way to provocations - whether they 're real or just assumed .
now the eu has swallowed its anger and , without any effort from the russia side , offered to restart negotiations .
the baltic , poland and the czech republic gnashed their teeth , but gave in to the political pressure of the big powers in the eu .
was this the right step ?
did n't it show moscow it could get away with anything without being punished for it ?
finance crisis changed situation yes , it was right - particularly because the situation has changed fundamentally for all parties involved .
since the war in the caucasus , the financial crisis has taken center stage .
it has hit the us hard , and the eu as well , but russia is affected even more .
as long as the global economy is running smoothly , russia can charge high prices for gas and oil , its main exports .
but now , with the world slipping into recession and energy prices falling , the russian economy is showing its vulnerable side .
in addition , the eu is now trying to become less dependent on russian energy .
when the economic situation in russia takes a downturn , it can quickly lead to political discontentment and instability .
and that is a threat to the stability of eastern europe , and essentially the continent as a whole .
that 's a reason for concern .
even though russia is still ranting and making threats , the government in moscow has known since this fall at the latest just how dependent both sides are on each other .
for that reason , it should pay off for both that the eu has now taken the first step .
still , it 's essential that problems be talked about openly as part of the new dialogue .
after all , it 's the beginning of a long , difficult discussion process .

15 , called for cooperation after their meeting in the border town of komarno , they mostly engaged in a stinging exchange that did more to highlight their disagreements than signal a quick way out of the crisis .
" the biggest problem is the export of fascism and extremism from hungarian territory to slovakia , " fico said at a press conference televised on the ta3 news channel .
he urged his counterpart to crack down on hungary 's neo-nazis , who have contributed to escalating tensions in recent weeks .
" it is unacceptable for us ... that 28 people dressed in hungarian fascist uniforms cross the border and march through a slovak town , " fico said referring to a recent incident .
accusations of nationalism speaking through an interpreter , gyurcsany countered that slovak politics " are not merely flirting with nationalism , but are engaged to it " and urged fico to fight extremists in his own government .
relations between the two neighbours have deteriorated since the summer of 2006 when fico formed a three-party government , which includes the slovak national party , led by jan slota .
the controversial slovak politician has repeatedly attacked hungary .
the tensions have escalated in recent weeks , owing to a string of extremist acts on both sides of the border .
slota recently insulted hungarian foreign minister kinga goncz , likening her to adolf hitler , while hungarian right-wing extremists have protested over territorial claims in slovakia , once part of hungary . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what exactly is bretton woods ? they hope that saturday 's summit in washington of 20 leading economies will lay the basis for a new international finance order , similar to the 1944 agreement in the new hampshire resort town of bretton woods .
world war ii was still raging when delegates from 44 allied nations met for the first three weeks of july , 1944 , to set up a new system of rules and institutions that would regulate the international monetary system .
it was clear that european currencies would not be able to meet rising demands for international liquidity , so the delegates agreed to peg the currencies of industrialized countries at a fixed rate to the us dollar .
in the wake of the great depression the goal was to avoid the sort of problems of currency fluctuations that plagued the international monetary system during the 1930s as the world recovered from the great depression .
in 1944 , the us currency was still backed by gold , to the tune of $ 35 to the ounce , and was seen as the strongest currency in the world .
" at bottom , the bretton woods system rested on one simple assumption - that economic policy in the united states would be stabilizing , " writes benjamin cohen , a professor of international political economy at the university of california in santa barbara .
the bretton woods agreement also set up the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the predecessor of the world bank to carry out the agreement and regulate the international monetary system .
while the imf and world bank continue to operate , the fixed currency system fell apart as the us increased its deficit spending during the vietnam war and great society years of social outlays of the 1960s .
it became ever clearer that the us could no longer back the dollar with gold , and washington suspended the gold standard in 1971 to allow it to float to its own level .
by 1973 , industrialized countries agreed to let their currencies also float free .
the bretton woods agreement was formally signed on dec .

he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "
" i do n't want to spend my life doing mega-projects or big pharaonic works , " he insists . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .
we had just entered the world stage at a time that the institutions ruling the world were changing due to the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero lobbied hard for the invitation even -lrb- former spanish prime minister jose maria -rrb- aznar had a high international profile and tried to get spain to be the 8th country when the g7 was expanding into the g8 , but at that time the g7 members wanted to include russia for geopolitical reasons instead of adjusting their membership rules to include yet another eu country . aznar was the opposite of zapatero : he tried to enhance spain 's profile in the world by being close to bush and blair and supporting the iraq war , which the spanish public was very much opposed to . yes .
zapatero did n't feel the need to be a member of the g8 in order to further spain 's foreign policy goals . besides , the socialists have pushed for more ideological goals that promote intercultural understanding or alleviate poverty under the un umbrella , such as alliance for civilizations or the international alliance against hunger , so being part of a rich g8 club that represents inequalities would 've been seen as contradictory .
also , the anti-globalization movement has hardly made it attractive for us to join the g8 , even if we were invited . but why is this g20 summit different ? because this is not g8 or g20 business as usual - it 's about reforming global capitalism and we need to be part of the discussion on what went wrong with the international finance system and how we can collectively get out of the mess .
why should argentina be there and not us ? what is the state of spain 's economy now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a sense , zapatero can thank bush for his election victories , says torreblanca we have a very flexible , deregulated market , but that makes us more sensitive to economic cycles .
when there 's growth in europe , we can easily jump into the wave and surf .
our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our construction boom has been the main engine of phenomenal growth in the last few years and spain 's open labor market enabled a wave of immigrants to fill plenty of low wage jobs , which were very much in demand at the time of economic take-off . but when there 's an economic slowdown in europe , we also suffer more heavily than the others , since these are the very jobs that also get axed quickly in a crisis . the spanish financial system seems to have weathered the crisis better than the uk and us .
none of spain 's banks went belly up and the current crisis has been a boon for banco santander , so maybe the others have something to learn from spain at the summit ? what we have learned about banks is that we know nothing about them .
the trouble is that the inter-lending banking system , which is crucial to the world economy , has dried up since banks do n't trust each other anymore . -lrb- former socialist prime minister -rrb- felipe gonzalez once claimed that spain 's got the best banking system in the world , but i 'd be a bit cautious about that . it 's true that our banking practices have been more conservative than other europeans due to self-regulation and stricter government oversight .
we have n't had bailouts yet in spain , but the credit squeeze has forced the government to inject fresh liquidity into the system .
we have problems too , so the main argument for going to washington is not to teach anyone a lesson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is likely to visit an obama white house more often zapatero 's first and last trip to the bush white house should help improve us-spain bilateral relations . opposing bush has helped zapatero get elected -lrb- in 2004 -rrb- and win re-elections -lrb- earlier this year -rrb- , so maybe he can even thank bush for helping him to become prime minister . do you see relations improving under president-elect barack obama ? yes .
obama has a more multilateral vision of world politics .
he understands that complex problems require complex solutions that need to be negotiated with allies .
we can do a lot together - to tackle poverty and climate change .
even on hard military issues in iraq and afghanistan , we can at least talk to the us , although we might see things differently .
the atmosphere in an obama white house is going to be more conducive to disagree in a polite way , and i expect the personal chemistry between obama and zapatero will be good . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "

14 , with a formal white house dinner .
" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new : but what happens next ?
" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .
created in 1999 , the g20 accounts for 85 percent of the world economy and about two-thirds of its population .
its members are the united states , germany , japan , france , italy , britain and canada , the european union , argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea and turkey .

" we share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil , " said bush , as the delegates dined on fruitwood-smoked quail and thyme-roasted rack of lamb .
the us has an interest in tightening financial regulations in order to restore confidence in the financial system " to guarantee that capital inflows continue , " germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters friday on the sidelines of the meeting .
he emphasized the historical nature of the summit , where emerging nations like brazil , russia , india and china are represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want a german plan on the agenda financial reforms and regulations would n't be finalized until march 31 , however , said steinbrueck .
a high-ranking french official told reporters the leaders planned to meet again in april .
however , there 's no guarantee that democratic president-elect barack obama - who did not attend the summit - would implement any promises that bush makes , when he takes office on jan .
20 germany calls for bonus cuts , loan databank leaders of the group of twenty most important economies continue talks saturday , where they will be debating the best way of tackling the on-going fallout from the crash last year of the us real estate market and how they can work together to save the global financial sector .
germany is set to present its contribution to the global efforts : a brief calling for a revision of the way banking executives are paid and the creation of a worldwide loan registry .
compiled by german financial experts , the brief was commissioned by steinbrueck and german chancellor angela merkel .
led by otmar issing , a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , the experts in charge of the brief claim short-term performance bonuses for financial executives have been a significant cause of the global financial crisis .
the experts call for alternative incentives , such as increasing pension rights for good work .
but issing and the other experts said government regulations on pay would not work .
the group also includes a plan for a world database of loans in the brief , similar to the public land registries which in many countries show who owns land .
registries would allow governments to quickly see how big the credit risks in a nation were .
the issing group also calls for annual public reviews by independent auditors of ratings agencies .
merkel : tough is n't a reason to give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants rapid action to stop recession spreading despite the emphasis on unity as a key component to success at the talks , merkel said in a newspaper interview that she expects " difficult talks " but added it was crucial that the first steps towards improved financial regulation were taken soon .
" of course these are going to be difficult talks -lrb- in washington -rrb- , but as europeans we are used to that , " merkel said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's friday issue .
" but what will definitely not happen is that we simply ignore the problems just because they can not be solved within 24 hours .
it is a tough nut to crack but i will keep trying . "
the german chancellor called for the improvement of international regulation , including strengthening of the role of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and improved coordination between national authorities , in order to prevent a repeat of the mistakes of the past .
she added that there was a " danger " that the current reform zeal " is allowed to go to sleep as soon as the first signs of an -lrb- economic -rrb- improvement appear . "
" but this will not happen .
we have to implement the first steps in the coming months .
the target is that in future all areas , all products and all businesses are properly regulated and supervised , " merkel added .
merkel also said the developing economies must be given more responsibilities within the imf .
" -lrb- this -rrb- has to mean that we -lrb- the industrialized economies -rrb- allow them more possibilities to wield influence .
that will happen at the expense of industrialized countries but that is how it goes , " she said .
europe sees small steps , not big solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso admitted europe was verging on slowdown european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed merkel 's mild pessimism by saying that he did not expect a " miracle " at the g20 summit but rather the first steps in tackling the direst problems facing the global economy .
" we can not expect a miracle from this summit , which was europe 's idea , but will rather see the beginning of a process that will create a finished program in 100 days , " he said an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday .
" this summit must not fail . "
he acknowledged that europe was " on the verge of a serious economic slowdown " and said the 27 european union member states must roll out measures to shore up their real economies .
white house transition fuels uncertainties the g20 leaders also face the problem of dealing with a us administration in its last days of power ; one which can not provide the world with any promises as to what the following government will attempt to achieve .
however , before bush departs after eight years in office , he wants a plan of action to overhaul the international financial system and hopes it can be achieved at the g20 summit .

" the leaders attending this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose : to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future , " bush said thursday , adding that the g20 must cooperate to improve banks ' risk management practices , improve accounting rules for securities so that their " true value " is clear and harmonize accounting laws among nations .

18 .
barcelo , who is being compared with pablo picasso -lrb- 1881-1973 -rrb- and joan miro -lrb- 1893-1983 -rrb- , worked for 13 months on redecorating a negotiating room which will now be known as the chamber for human rights and the alliance of civilizations .
the alliance of civilizations project was launched by zapatero and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan to improve dialogue between the west and the muslim world in 2006 .
a new masterpiece the ceiling created by barcelo has been compared with michelangelo 's work at the sistine chapel .
it turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" the cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big african tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " barcelo explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bercelo 's work at the un headquarters has been likened to the sistine chapel " the sea is the past , the origin of the species , and the promise of a new future : emigration , travel , " he adds .
the 51-year-old artist describes his new work as " reaching towards the infinite , bringing a multiplicity of points of view , " like " el libro de arena " -lrb- " the book of sand , " 1975 -rrb- by the late argentine writer jorge luis borges , whose grave barcelo visited during his stay in geneva .
is art truly priceless ?
few question the artistic value of the ceiling created by barcelo , but its cost has sparked controversy .
the renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , 60 percent of which was covered by spanish sponsors .
the rest was paid for by the government , including 500,000 euros that were taken from a development aid fund .
" art has no price , " foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .
but the government countered the comments , insisting the money did not come from funds which would have been used for such projects .
talk of the money having been " stolen from the poor " was not a reflection of reality , said barcelo .
barcelo 's art an " act of resistance " the spaniard 's team included 20 specialists ranging from a speleologist and a cook to architects and engineers .
special machinery was designed to create the artificial stalactites some of which weigh more than 50 kilograms -lrb- 110 pounds -rrb- .
thirty-five tons of paint was used on the work , which measures 1,400 square meters -lrb- 15,000 square feet -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish foreign minister moratinos has defended the pricetag on barcelo 's piece barcelo , who has mastered nearly all artistic techniques - ranging from painting and sculpture to performance art - soared to fame early in his career and is now regarded as one of the world 's top contemporary artists .
dividing his time between his native majorca , paris and mali in west africa , barcelo has absorbed a wide range of influences such as european baroque and other african styles .
" to think that art has made a lot of progress between -lrb- the cave paintings of -rrb- altamira and -lrb- paul -rrb- cezanne is a vain and western attempt , " says the artist , who has described painting as " mud that i stir with a stick . "
fascinated by processes of transformation on land and in the sea , barcelo sees his art as an " organized chaos " and as an " act of resistance . "
among his other projects is a collection of modern terracotta murals created for a gothic chapel in the cathedral of palma de majorca , which was finished in 2007 .
but with such venerated work behind him , the award-winning artist has vowed not to become an " official dinosaur . "
" i do n't want to spend my life doing mega-projects or big pharaonic works , " he insists . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 15.11.2008 spain 's zapatero takes extra seat at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush invited zapatero to the white house at sarkozy 's request dw-world.de spoke to a spanish foreign policy expert about his country 's special invitation to attend saturday 's g20 summit in washington after years of being snubbed by the bush administration . in little more than 30 years , spain has metamorphosed from the poverty and isolation of the franco dictatorship to become the world 's 8th largest economy and one of the most politically tolerant countries in europe .
but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .

but it is not a member of the g20 group of leading industrial nations and developing countries invited to saturday 's emergency summit in washington to discuss global financial reforms . socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is also the only major european leader who has never visited the white house , largely due to a falling out with outgoing president george w. bush over spain 's unilateral troop withdrawal from iraq in 2004 .
but this time , an invitation to the prestigious summit matters . since france 's president nicolas sarkozy held two seats in his dual role as current eu president and g20 member , he gave one up .
the netherlands , czech republic and a few arab states all jockeyed for the extra seat , but spain won out after zapatero 's intense lobbying efforts . dw-world.de spoke to jose ignacio torreblanca , 39 , head of the european council on foreign relations in madrid about spain 's participation at the g20 summit and bilateral relations with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose ignacio torreblanca dw-world.de : does spain deserve to be at the g20 , rather than the czech republic , which holds the next eu presidency starting january ? jose ignacio torreblanca : whether spain deserves to be among the g20 can not be framed in legal , but in political terms .
the question is , does it make sense to include spain ?
can spain make a contribution to the goals of the g20 ?
why ca n't this club be a g22 or g30 for that matter ? the problem for spain is that there are already enough europeans in the g20 or the g7 subset of rich industrial nations , plus the eu also has a seat .
so why bring even more european partners to the table when the legitimacy of the club would be enhanced by expanding membership to include non-western nations ? it would seem that spain has a good argument for being a member based on its economic might and an annual growth rate of nearly 4 percent in the last decade or so . it has even surpassed g8 member italy by some economic indicators like per capita income .
so why is italy , for example , in and spain out ? this has to do with the latecomer effect when certain structures were already in place and we were n't yet ready to be a part of them .
spain only joined the european community -lrb- forerunner to the eu -rrb- in 1986 and had a referendum in favor of nato membership the same year .

" history is repeating itself " in italy , piero terracina said friday , nov .
14 , at a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the notorious racial laws targeting jews , which were approved by the italian cabinet on nov .
15 , 1938 .
" everything started with the census of the jews and the terrible consequences to which this led us , " said terracina , reported afp news agency .
the 80-year-old holocaust survivor was freed from the auschwitz concentration camp in january 1945 , shortly before the end of world war ii .
the discriminatory decrees introduced in both nazi germany and italy under then leader benito mussolini included the prohibition of mixed marriages between jews and so-called " aryans " and economic restrictions on jews , among other measures .
controversial laws affecting roma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma were also persecuted by the nazis in september , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government came under fire from the european union when it passed a controversial security package that seemed to be aimed against the country 's large roma community .
significantly , city authorities in rome have said they would conduct a census of the roma population , but , under hefty pressure from the eu , agreed to cancel plans for mass fingerprinting .
the new deal also made illegal immigration a criminal offense with a prison sentence and made the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail .
when interior minister roberto maroni announced the measures earlier this year , he said they were intended to " prevent phenomena such as begging . "
anti-roma pages removed from facebook on friday , the social networking portal facebook said it had removed seven pages from its web site that had been created by italian far-right extremists to incite violence against roma .
the european parliament had lodged a complaint with the california-based company .
facebook said it bans hateful material , but shimon samuels from the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish human rights group , told reuters news agency that the portal should create technology to filter out " hate speech . "
" it 's not a new thing - it 's happened before , it 's even happened before on facebook , " he said .

the move follows months of fighting and officials say pitched battles are still taking place in the area .
if the army succeeds in taking control , it will have access to the land route up the north-west coast to jaffna .
the peninsula has been cut off by territory held by the rebels , who want a separate state for the tamil people .
the tamil tigers have not yet commented on the reports .
' last bastion ' troops entered pooneryn on saturday morning , according to the defence ministry .
it said in a statement that soldiers had crossed marshlands south of the town during the night , and then marched into what was described as the rebels ' last bastion on the western coast .
it added that the tigers were putting up stiff resistance and that pitched battles were still going on in the area .
for months , amid heavy fighting , troops have pushed up the north-western coast towards pooneryn , trying to open a land route to jaffna , situated just across a lagoon from the town .
the far northern peninsula is in government hands , but has been cut off by territory held by the tamil tigers .
the only ways in and out for troops , supplies and civilians have been by sea and air .
the rebels , who have been fighting for decades for a separate state for the island 's ethnic tamil minority , have not commented on the defence ministry 's claims .
the government has barred independent reporters from the areas where battles are taking place .

chamber of trade members say they should have special consideration because of the " disturbance " they have suffered due to redevelopments .
chamber secretary eirian james said the work had been going on for over 12 months , and was affecting trade .
gwynedd council said some people had taken unfair advantage of the free parking .
last year , the council did not to offer the perk of free parking at its 41 pay-and-display car parks throughout the county .
the free parking scheme had run for 11 years .
" we were all disappointed last year because people knew that parking was free as soon as the schools broke up for the holidays , " said ms james .
" we suffered a double whammy with the cost of parking going up in the summer , then the work starting on the town square .
" this year we will be putting pressure on the council to bring free parking back , as the redevelopment work is still going on after 12 months , and there has been a lot of disturbance , " she added .
however , shoppers will be able to take advantage of free parking in one area of the town as the harbour trust is to allow free parking at its slate quay site for the holiday .
" we are extremely grateful to them for this , " said ms james .
a gwynedd council spokesman said the end of the free parking was part of a review in the county .
" this is in line with practises in a number of nearby counties , " he said .
" we would also note that one of the main reasons for doing away with this practice was because there was a tendency by some to park for long periods in the car parks during his period .

gwynedd council said some people had taken unfair advantage of the free parking .
last year , the council did not to offer the perk of free parking at its 41 pay-and-display car parks throughout the county .
the free parking scheme had run for 11 years .
" we were all disappointed last year because people knew that parking was free as soon as the schools broke up for the holidays , " said ms james .
" we suffered a double whammy with the cost of parking going up in the summer , then the work starting on the town square .
" this year we will be putting pressure on the council to bring free parking back , as the redevelopment work is still going on after 12 months , and there has been a lot of disturbance , " she added .
however , shoppers will be able to take advantage of free parking in one area of the town as the harbour trust is to allow free parking at its slate quay site for the holiday .
" we are extremely grateful to them for this , " said ms james .
a gwynedd council spokesman said the end of the free parking was part of a review in the county .
" this is in line with practises in a number of nearby counties , " he said .
" we would also note that one of the main reasons for doing away with this practice was because there was a tendency by some to park for long periods in the car parks during his period .
" this did not help turnover and meant shoppers could not always benefit from the scheme . "

michael perham , 16 , from potters bar in hertfordshire is the youngest person to have sailed across the atlantic alone .
he set out on his latest voyage from gunwharf quays , portsmouth , on his open 50 racing yacht on saturday morning .
he will be alone at sea for over four months and his only contact with family will be through satellite link-ups .
michael said : " i 'm a little bit nervous but otherwise really , really excited .
" it 's just the feeling of being completely in control , relaxed and at one with nature .
it 's just fantastic .
but you do n't look forward to the fact you are alone for about four months . "
psychologists have helped prepare him mentally for the challenges ahead and he said his experience crossing the atlantic would also stand him in good stead .
his mother , heather , said the family was right behind him : " we 're all really excited , we 're so proud of what he 's going to be doing .
" he 's just such an inspiration for other young people - for anyone really - we 're just amazed we 've got to this point . "
his family have also put a pile of gifts and decorations on board his yacht for christmas .
by then he is expected to be in the south atlantic , near the cape of good hope off the coast of south africa .
his parents , heather , 51 , and peter , 49 , and 18-year-old sister fiona all support him .
mr perham , a chartered quantity surveyor and experienced sailor , introduced his son to sailing at the age of seven .
" as a parent there is always anxiety , even he has anxiety .
" but whether he is 16 , 26 or 36 , as a parent you are always concerned for your children , " said mr perham . "
i could n't have done what he is doing at his age " peter perham , michael 's father meet michael perham " but it will be an amazing achievement .
i take my hat off to him completely .
i could n't have done what he is doing at his age .
" hopefully he will inspire other young people . "
he is expected to arrive back in portsmouth some time near his 17th birthday on 16 march 2009 .
the current holder of the youngest non-stop circumnavigator title is 18-year-old australian , jesse martin , who arrived home in melbourne on october 31 , 1999 .
to set a new record , michael 's journey must be entirely unassisted and completed under sail by wind and muscle power alone .
his journey will pass the coast of africa , cross the pacific ocean and the southern ocean via the cape of good hope in south africa , cape leeuwin in australia and cape horn on the southern tip of south america .
his adventure does not get him out of school work either .
he is taking assignments with him as part of his btec national diploma in sport -lrb- performance and excellence -rrb- at oaklands college in st albans , hertfordshire .
money raised from the epic voyage will be donated to save the children and the tall ships youth trust .

michael perham , 16 , from potters bar in hertfordshire is the youngest person to have sailed across the atlantic alone .
he set out on his latest voyage from gunwharf quays , portsmouth , on his open 50 racing yacht on saturday morning .
he will be alone at sea for over four months and his only contact with family will be through satellite link-ups .
michael said : " i 'm a little bit nervous but otherwise really , really excited .
" it 's just the feeling of being completely in control , relaxed and at one with nature .
it 's just fantastic .
but you do n't look forward to the fact you are alone for about four months . "

a look around mike perham 's boat psychologists have helped prepare him mentally for the challenges ahead and he said his experience crossing the atlantic would also stand him in good stead .
his mother , heather , said the family was right behind him : " we 're all really excited , we 're so proud of what he 's going to be doing .
" he 's just such an inspiration for other young people - for anyone really - we 're just amazed we 've got to this point . "
his family have also put a pile of gifts and decorations on board his yacht for christmas .
by then he is expected to be in the south atlantic , near the cape of good hope off the coast of south africa .
his parents , heather , 51 , and peter , 49 , and 18-year-old sister fiona all support him .
mr perham , a chartered quantity surveyor and experienced sailor , introduced his son to sailing at the age of seven .
" as a parent there is always anxiety , even he has anxiety .
" but whether he is 16 , 26 or 36 , as a parent you are always concerned for your children , " said mr perham .
i could n't have done what he is doing at his age peter perham , michael 's father meet michael perham " but it will be an amazing achievement .

the current holder of the youngest non-stop circumnavigator title is 18-year-old australian , jesse martin , who arrived home in melbourne on october 31 , 1999 .
to set a new record , michael 's journey must be entirely unassisted and completed under sail by wind and muscle power alone .
his journey will pass the coast of africa , cross the pacific ocean and the southern ocean via the cape of good hope in south africa , cape leeuwin in australia and cape horn on the southern tip of south america .

michael perham , 16 , from potters bar in hertfordshire is the youngest person to have sailed across the atlantic alone .
he set out on his latest voyage from gunwharf quays , portsmouth , on his open 50 racing yacht on saturday morning .
he will be alone at sea for over four months and his only contact with family will be through satellite link-ups .
michael said : " i 'm a little bit nervous but otherwise really , really excited .
" it 's just the feeling of being completely in control , relaxed and at one with nature .
it 's just fantastic .
but you do n't look forward to the fact you are alone for about four months . "
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
a look around mike perham 's boat psychologists have helped prepare him mentally for the challenges ahead and he said his experience crossing the atlantic would also stand him in good stead .
his mother , heather , said the family was right behind him : " we 're all really excited , we 're so proud of what he 's going to be doing .
" he 's just such an inspiration for other young people - for anyone really - we 're just amazed we 've got to this point . "
his family have also put a pile of gifts and decorations on board his yacht for christmas .
by then he is expected to be in the south atlantic , near the cape of good hope off the coast of south africa .
his parents , heather , 51 , and peter , 49 , and 18-year-old sister fiona all support him .
mr perham , a chartered quantity surveyor and experienced sailor , introduced his son to sailing at the age of seven .
" as a parent there is always anxiety , even he has anxiety .
" but whether he is 16 , 26 or 36 , as a parent you are always concerned for your children , " said mr perham .
i could n't have done what he is doing at his age peter perham , michael 's father meet michael perham " but it will be an amazing achievement .
i take my hat off to him completely .
i could n't have done what he is doing at his age .
" hopefully he will inspire other young people . "
he is expected to arrive back in portsmouth some time near his 17th birthday on 16 march 2009 .
the current holder of the youngest non-stop circumnavigator title is 18-year-old australian , jesse martin , who arrived home in melbourne on october 31 , 1999 .
to set a new record , michael 's journey must be entirely unassisted and completed under sail by wind and muscle power alone .
his journey will pass the coast of africa , cross the pacific ocean and the southern ocean via the cape of good hope in south africa , cape leeuwin in australia and cape horn on the southern tip of south america .
