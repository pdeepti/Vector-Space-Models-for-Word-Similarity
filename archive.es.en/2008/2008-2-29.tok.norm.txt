now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "

29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy .

29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy . " " western media have to stop using words like campaign and election , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 29.02.2008 serbia ties eu bid to kosovo issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs took to the streets of austria 's capital , vienna to protest against kosovo 's independence serbia 's prime minister has said his country 's eu membership depends on brussels recognizing serbia and kosovo as a single entity and expressed hostility to an international mission to monitor independence in kosovo . serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica repeated his stance that belgrade will not discuss eu membership unless brussels recognized serbia and kosovo as a single state .
backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .

kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .

according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "

located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .

initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "
the couple 's lawyers , meanwhile , have described the incident as a " serious breach of their personal rights and are still to decide whether they will settle with an apology . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .

after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .
29 , said the mission was a success . " we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...

" foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .
29 , said the mission was a success . " we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...
the government refuses to allow lebanon to become an arena for settling regional conflicts , " saniora said , adding that the only foreign ships in lebanese waters were part of the un mission . white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe confirmed thursday that the us had sent a warship to the area in what he described as " a show of support for regional stability . " foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country .

the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.02.2008 putin calls for high voter turnout ahead of russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready for voting though his hand-picked successor has been all but named , russian president vladimir putin urged voters friday , feb .
29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy . " " western media have to stop using words like campaign and election , " he said .
" you are misleading your public .
in russia , instead , we are talking about a farce . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "
the couple 's lawyers , meanwhile , have described the incident as a " serious breach of their personal rights and are still to decide whether they will settle with an apology . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ?

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .

further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .

located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ?

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .

" we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...

" foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .

the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .

" we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...

" foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 29.02.2008 new german archive focuses on music silenced by the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forms of art , including music , were forbidden by the nazis numerous jewish musicians across europe were forbidden from performing or publishing their compositions during the nazi years .
now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "
the couple 's lawyers , meanwhile , have described the incident as a " serious breach of their personal rights and are still to decide whether they will settle with an apology . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .

" we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...

" foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .

" " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "

after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.02.2008 putin calls for high voter turnout ahead of russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready for voting though his hand-picked successor has been all but named , russian president vladimir putin urged voters friday , feb .
29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy . " " western media have to stop using words like campaign and election , " he said .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .

the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .

the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .

located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack .

" after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "

initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .

" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .
29 , said the mission was a success . " we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...
the government refuses to allow lebanon to become an arena for settling regional conflicts , " saniora said , adding that the only foreign ships in lebanese waters were part of the un mission . white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe confirmed thursday that the us had sent a warship to the area in what he described as " a show of support for regional stability . " foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

" we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences .

29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy . " " western media have to stop using words like campaign and election , " he said .

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .
29 , said the mission was a success . " we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...
the government refuses to allow lebanon to become an arena for settling regional conflicts , " saniora said , adding that the only foreign ships in lebanese waters were part of the un mission . white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe confirmed thursday that the us had sent a warship to the area in what he described as " a show of support for regional stability . " foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.02.2008 germany opens massive cold war bunker as museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was fitted with equipment in case of nuclear or chemical attack hidden beneath the vine-covered hills of the ahr valley , the enormous nuclear bunker was one of west germany 's best kept secrets during the cold war .
now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .

although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .

it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .

kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .

serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .

the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .

the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .

" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves .

" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .

" in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy . " " western media have to stop using words like campaign and election , " he said .

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .
" there is no real opposition ahead of the election .
there is no real electoral campaign battle . " she added that only people in russia 's two largest cities , moscow and st. petersburg , had access to opposition media . the corruption watchdog transparency international said on thursday that between dec.1 and feb.15 , medvedev had received more coverage in national media than his three rivals combined . former world chess champion and kremlin opponent garry kasparov said he has plans to hold street protests the day after the election that would " show the authorities that we 're prepared to stand up to their plans to destroy democracy .

29 , to go to the polls in the presidential elections on sunday .
critics have called the vote a " farce . " in televised statement to the nation , the outgoing president stressed that his successor would need a citizens ' trust and a broad mandate to run the country efficiently . " we all understand what a great and responsible role the leader of a state such as russia is - and how important it is for him to have the faith of his citizens , " putin said in a short address on russian television .
" he needs it for effective and confident work in his presidential post , to ensure stability in the country . " the kremlin leader had tipped his deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev as his successor two weeks after putin 's party united russia won a solid majority in the parliamentary vote last december . putin , who after two consecutive four-year terms as president is barred from running for the office again , has said he would become prime minister under a medvedev presidency and is considered by many to be the one source of medvedev 's power . securing the putin plan 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder how long the prime minister 's mainly domestic duties will please putin friday was the last day for official campaigning before the " day of silence " ahead of sunday 's elections . but putin 's encouragement was tepid compared to bristling rhetoric he used ahead of the december parliamentary election when he said the vote was needed to protect the country against enemy " jackals , " and " wolves . "
after winning in december , putin no longer had to fear a defeat in march , according to vitaly ivanov , an analyst with the center for the study of current political events . " in essence , the two election campaigns were seen by putin as two stages of a single campaign , which would first lead to the renewal of the regime and , second , to securing the continuity of his policy line , " he said in comments published by state newspaper izvestia . the " political squabbles " of democracy with russia in the midst of an economic boom , mainly due to record prices for gas and oil , medvedev has said he will have little to do other than continue putin 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'll continue the policies putin put in place " if i am entrusted with leading the state i will simply be obliged to continue the policies ... of president vladimir vladimirovich putin , " the 42-year-old medvedev said .
" i hope if we continue to work in this format , as a pair , it will benefit our country . " in a press conference this month , putin said he was pleased that medvedev was able to continue in his official duties as deputy prime minister . " otherwise the country could have run the risk of sinking into endless political squabbles , " he said . putin 's critics , however , have said that medvedev 's decision not to take part in political debates and the blanket coverage he receives by the media has turned the election - which also features three other candidates - into a one-sided race . medvedev triples opposition 's combined support medvedev enjoyed 70 percent support in recent polls by state-owned pollster vtsiom .
nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky was in second place on 11 percent , gennady zyuganov third with 10 percent and andrei bogdanov polled at 1 percent . most western election observers are not monitoring the vote , citing obstruction by the authorities and the lack of any real choice or even political debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin may have to make room for medvedev - at least on a few channels " television broadcasts naturally give a very one-sided view as they are controlled by the state , " friederike behr , an amnesty international russia researcher told a news conference in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.02.2008 germany opens massive cold war bunker as museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was fitted with equipment in case of nuclear or chemical attack hidden beneath the vine-covered hills of the ahr valley , the enormous nuclear bunker was one of west germany 's best kept secrets during the cold war .
now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.02.2008 germany opens massive cold war bunker as museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was fitted with equipment in case of nuclear or chemical attack hidden beneath the vine-covered hills of the ahr valley , the enormous nuclear bunker was one of west germany 's best kept secrets during the cold war .
now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 29.02.2008 new german archive focuses on music silenced by the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forms of art , including music , were forbidden by the nazis numerous jewish musicians across europe were forbidden from performing or publishing their compositions during the nazi years .
now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission , which did not confiscate any weapons , was called success by german defense minister jung . italian rear admiral ruggiero di biase is to take charge of the un maritime task force , which was created to end the 33-day conflict between israel and lebanon in 2006 and to prevent weapons from being smuggled by sea to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . german defense minister franz josef jung , on hand at the ceremony on the german frigate bayern on friday , feb .
29 , said the mission was a success . " we can guarantee that no weapons were smuggled by sea , " he said , adding that in the last 17 months some 13,000 ships had been checked and no weapons were discovered . the deployment represents the bundeswehr 's first deployment to the middle east . un mission continues indefinitely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unclear how long foreign ships will keep patrolling the coast of lebanon , jung said germany contributed 2,400 personnel , including 625 soldiers , to the naval mission and led the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- for 17 months , with a maritime force consisting of among others two frigates , two supply ships .
the multinational force also includes ships from france , spain and portugal . germany is set to reduce its presence from seven ships to four and the number of sailors to 500 . jung said it remains unclear how long the un mission will continue to patrol along the lebanese coast .
the german ships ' mandate is scheduled for parliamentary renewal in september . us assistance that was n't requested the handover comes amid reports that the united states is sending the uss cole warship toward waters off the lebanese coast in a move it says is intended to support regional stability . but lebanese prime minister fuad saniora said that his country has not requested the americans help and that the ship would not enter lebanese waters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saniora said lebanon had not requested help from the us " the lebanese government did not call for any intervention ...
the government refuses to allow lebanon to become an arena for settling regional conflicts , " saniora said , adding that the only foreign ships in lebanese waters were part of the un mission . white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe confirmed thursday that the us had sent a warship to the area in what he described as " a show of support for regional stability . " foreign interference in lebanon the uss cole , a destroyer armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , was dispatched to the area from malta amid the political crisis in lebanon that washington has blamed on syrian interference . hezbollah member of parliament hassan fadlallah said friday that " sending a warship and threatening military force is proof that the american administration has failed in imposing its policies and hegemony on our region . " " the americans are trying to support their -lrb- anti-syrian ruling majority -rrb- allies in lebanon with its warships , " he said . lebanon has been locked in a deep political division between the western-backed ruling majority and the hezbollah-led opposition , which is supported by syria and iran .
the crisis has prevented political parties from electing a new president to replace pro-syrian politician emile lahoud , whose term ended nov .

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "
the couple 's lawyers , meanwhile , have described the incident as a " serious breach of their personal rights and are still to decide whether they will settle with an apology . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

backed by russia , serbia and kosovo 's 120,000 remaining serbs continue to reject the western-backed secession .
" for us ... -lsb- it is -rsb- clear - when it comes to any further negotiations on eu membership it means for us only serbia with kosovo , ' he told the russia today tv channel on thursday , feb .
28 .
kostunica has already frozen serbia 's eu membership bid over the western support of kosovo 's independence , declared on feb .
17 .
serbia has also recalled ambassadors for consultations from the 20 countries that have recognized kosovo so far .
belgrade 's relations with the west have been chilly in the wake of last week 's riots targeting the us and other embassies representing countries that serbian nationalists consider to be hostile .
face-to-face at a meeting of balkan foreign ministers in sofia , serbian and kosovar officials came face-to-face thursday for the first time since kosovo declared independence .
" let me tell you loud and clear : for as long as serbia is , kosovo shall never be , " warned serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" kosovo will not be a member of the united nations .
it will not be a member of the osce .
and as such it will not belong to the world community of sovereign nations .
it will never acquire this ultimate status of legitimacy , " he said .
according to afp , jeremic also said that belgrade would ask the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- to ascertain " whether or not this -lsb- declaration of independence -rsb- was done in compliance with international law . "
the minister called on the international community not to recognize kosovo until the icj had made its ruling , stressing that kosovo 's " illegal attempt " to secede from serbia would create instability throughout the region and encourage separatist movements around the world .
jeremic also criticized the international community for asking serbia to choose between kosovo and the eu , and slammed balkan countries for succumbing to outside pressure and recognizing kosovo .
" deals have been made , pressure has been exerted , arms have been twisted - throughout the region , across europe and around the world , " jeremic added .
russia lambastes eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bundeswehr has 2000 troops in kosovo the eu 's mission to kosovo , eulex , is set to swing into action soon .
the mission , seen as an eu effort to assist kosovo 's government in developing a stable and multi-ethnic democracy , was deemed " illegal " by russia at the un security council on thursday .
composed of more than 2,000 police officers , judges and prosecutors , the mission will be cooperating with nato forces in kosovo to maintain stability there .
along with serbia , russia strongly opposes the eu presence in kosovo , charging that it violates international law and un resolutions .
germany , moreover , has decided to send more troops to kosovo , a bundeswehr source said on friday .
the extra soldiers would be deployed from the state of bavaria in the next few days as part of a training exercise , but the transfer was also meant to demonstrate the force 's strength in the context of recent violence , the source said .
germany already has more than 2,000 troops in kosovo which are part of the 16,000-plus nato-led kfor security force .
isg meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian leaders plan to reject eu membership if the west recognizes the independence of kosovo again with russia 's backing , serbian prime minister kostunica , meanwhile , has been railing against the establishment of the international steering group , meeting in the austrian capital vienna on thursday for the first time , to monitor kosovo 's progress after its declaration of independence .
" the illegal setting-up of an international steering group ... represents a most brutal violation of international law , " kostunica said in a statement .
he called on un secretary general ban ki-moon to " produce the precise legal documentary basis " upon which the decision to form the group had been taken .
the primary task of the isg will be to monitor the plan presented by un kosovo negotiator martti ahtisaari by the authorities of the newly independent former serbian province .
ahtisaari envisaged the formation of the isg in his status proposal , which foresaw internationally monitored independence for kosovo with special protection mechanisms for the serbian minority population and serbian cultural heritage .
the former finnish president 's plan met with strong opposition from belgrade and was subsequently rejected by russia in the un security council .
the steering group is made up of austria , belgium , britain , the czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hungary , italy , slovenia , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .

28 , that their governments were ready to follow the example set by the czech republic and conclude separate visa agreements with the united states . czech interior minister ivan langer signed a bilateral air security and visa accord with the us during a visit to washington on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu countries are frustrated that they still need a visa for us entry as part of the deal , the czech republic has agreed to strengthen cooperation on air security and provide the us with passengers ' data .
however , the accord surrenders more passenger information than a broader deal reached on behalf all 27-member nations . brussels say the czech-us deal contravenes eu rules and jeopardizes efforts to forge a common approach on the issue . " we can not tolerate any violation or discrepancy ... from european legislation in visa-related matters , " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said on thursday . eu backs down on wednesday , the european commission said it reserved the right to take action against prague .
frattini , however , said he would not take the czech republic to court for now because the deal it signed was only an outline pact and its implementation was key . the czech republic is one of 11 eu member states - former communist countries plus greece - whose citizens are obliged to have visas , even for a short stay , in order to travel to the us . czech interior minister ivan langer said his country had no alternative as eu-us talks had failed to get the czech republic , an eu member since 2004 , into the us visa scheme . " a well-fed man does not believe a hungry one , " langer told reporters on thursday .
" we 've been waiting for four years to share not only the duties but also the freedoms -lsb- of being in the eu -rsb- .
we wo n't have to wait in line , we wo n't have to pay for visas , we 'll feel like a real partner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the czech visa deal would allow air marshals on flights to the us langer added that slovakia , hungary , the baltic states , malta and greece were also " hungry . "
after thursday 's meeting , frattini conceded that progress had not been fast enough . " there was unanimous consensus about -lsb- the need to -rsb- speed up negotiations with the us on the basis of a common approach , " he said . frattini called on the us to stop trying to reach bilateral deals with individual eu countries and asked member states not to rush into new agreements with washington ahead of an eu-us justice and home affairs meeting scheduled for march 12-13 in slovenia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , part of the bunker is open to the public . it 's a 20-minute walk from the sleepy tourist town of ahrweiler up a serpentine path to the entrance to the new government bunker documentation center .
the 9-meter -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- high concrete wall marking the museum 's entrance seems completely out of place among the vineyards and woods of the ahr valley . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " warning : life-threatening danger ! "
a 200-meter stretch of the original subterranean bunker , which runs 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- under the hillside , has been restored to its original state for the museum . small exhibit rooms branch off from the bunker 's dimly-lit central corridor .
every couple of meters bright red signs warn people if the emergency siren goes off , they should immediately move away from the numerous heavy steels doors that line the corridor . grim exhibits a room filled with radiation decontamination equipment , including full-body suits , gas masks and oxygen tanks , reminds visitors of the then real threat of nuclear attacks in europe during the cold war .
further along the corridor , the bedroom intended for the german chancellor is fitted out with a spartan bed and basic locker .
it 's a bleak display of how luxury has no place during times of war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor and president were the only ones with the privilege of private rooms " it is a unique documentation of the cold war , and i think you can compare it in significance with the berlin wall , " dr. juergen pfoehler , the ahrweiler county commissioner , said at the museum 's inauguration . construction on the government bunker started in 1960 , a year before the berlin wall was built .
located only 30 kilometers from the then-west german capital of bonn , the nuclear shelter was designed to house 3,000 government officials for up to 30 days in the case of an attack . " these 3,000 were made up of german parliamentarians , the president , the chancellor , members of constitutional court -lsb- germany 's highest court -rsb- as well as others necessary for government , " explained paul gross , a tour guide at the museum , who worked for 36 years as a technician at the bunker . cut into the hillside by the time the project was completed in 1972 , the massive shelter had more than 936 bedrooms and 897 offices , as well as five field hospitals , a dentist and even a hairdresser .
although the bunker was never used , it was kept in a constant state of readiness by 200 full-time technical and administrative staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technicians made sure the bunker was constantly prepared for a possible attack " we would have been completely independent from the external world in case of attack , " gross said .
" we had our own electricity and water supplies , as well as food stores .
much of the food was designed to be prepared fresh , but there were also frozen supplies that we exchanged every four to five years . " after the end of the communist regime in east germany , in 1989 , and the transfer of reunified germany 's political institutions from bonn to berlin , in 1991 , the federal government decided to close the bunker , in 1997 . back then , it was never intended to make a museum out of the underground complex .
initially , the government explored the idea of selling the bunker , but it was unable to find a suitable commercial purpose .
it then resolved to strip the shelter down to its concrete walls and seal it off forever . given growing public interest in the bunker , however , florian mausbach , the president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning , decided to push to save part of it for future generations .
in a unique move , the federal government then decided to fund the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- museum , which has now been turned over to ahrweiler local government . learning from the past " the bunker was a part of the system of nuclear threats on both sides , " mausbach said .
" and our children do n't even know what the cold war means , so i think it is important to keep them informed and let them see this for themselves . " despite the bunker having been constructed for times of catastrophe , former technician paul gross has happy memories of his time in the shelter , where the staff was " like a big family . "
the bond was also strengthened , he explained , because they all shared the same problem : " we had to keep our work secret from our families . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker had five sections , which could all be isolated from each other there was one main drawback to gross ' work though .
in the case of a serious attack , technicians like gross would have been expected to man the bunker , which meant leaving their families and loved ones outside to face the consequences . " you would have been there in a safe place , and you would n't have known what was happening outside - are -lsb- your wife and children -rsb- alive , what are they doing , how are they coping ? " he said .
" you had to consider that . " the documentation center opens to the public on saturday , march 1 . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new center for ostracized music aims to recover these lost musical voices . after the introduction of race laws in 1933 , the german music chamber -lrb- reichsmusikkammer -rrb- established a registry of all german musicians .
as a result , many talented composers and musicians had their work deliberately suppressed because their race or style of music offended the third reich . works by renowned composers such as felix mendelssohn , gustav mahler , and arnold schoenberg were among those forbidden by the nazis . as the nazis occupied other parts of europe , the numbers of banned musicians grew .
however , many of these names are forgotten today .
in some case , this is because they were murdered by the nazis , and in others , their persecution meant they were unable to continue their creative work . revive forbidden music based at the schwerin music conservatorium , the center for ostracized music -lrb- zentrum für verfemte musik -rrb- , which opened last month , aims to bring these silenced works back to life . the conservatorium has already been extremely active in the promotion of ostracized music ; it holds an annual international silenced music competition , organizes concerts , and offers studies in the field .
according to jennu swensson , one of the archive employees , the center was the next logical step . " this music is such a huge treasure today , " she said .
" when you hear -lrb- it -rrb- , then you realize that this could have disappeared . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis banned the music of austrian composer arnold schoenberg , who moved to the us in 1934 the search for these forbidden compositions , scores and notebooks is a difficult and time consuming process .
this is because many of the banned musicians were unable to have their work published or recordings , she said . " you have to rely on contemporary eye witnesses or hope that their children have managed to hold onto some works , " swensson said . it was the son of italian composer aldo finzi who donated copies of his father 's compositions to the center , allowing the musician 's works to be reheard . " aldo finzi is virtually unknown , but here in schwerin , we have increased his visibility by showing off his work in many concerts , " said volker ahmels , the director of the conservatorium . born in 1897 , finzi came from an established milanese jewish family .
he was considered one of the most talented young composers of his generation .
but forced into hiding before being finally imprisoned by the nazis in 1944 , finzi 's health suffered and he died of a heart attack in 1945 . the archive currently holds 400 works from 50 ostracized composers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whitey " bulger - definitely not a german estate agent you 're kicking back on the couch friday night watching your favorite crime-fighting show , when suddenly your picture flashes up and you 're named as number two on the fbi 's most wanted list after osama bin laden . imagine .
the fbi wrongly identifies you as a heinous criminal suspected of 21 murders , drug dealing and blackmail .
and as if it that were n't bad enough , it shows your picture to the nation on primetime tv .
it 's enough to make you paranoid .
and it 's exactly what happened to a law-abiding german citizen , whose face was beamed into households around the country last friday night while a voiceover named him as james " whitey " bulger , former alcatraz inmate and head of boston 's notorious winter hill gang .
crime kingpin the fbi has been hunting james j. bulger since 1999 , and has offered a $ 1 million -lrb- 664,000 euros -rrb- reward for any information leading to his capture .
an organized crime kingpin , he and his lover catherine greig have been on the run for years .
after sightings in london in 2002 and uruguay two years later , us investigators recently decided to go public with the case on " aktenzeichen xy … ungelöst , " germany 's answer to " america 's most wanted , " convinced that the pair was currently traveling through europe .
oops maybe they are - and maybe they are n't .
they certainly were n't the couple featured in the footage watched by 5.11 million viewers .
the tv station fielded 25 calls after airing the footage - a record response for the show - including one from a panicked german couple who recognized themselves in the picture innocently holidaying in taormina on the island of sicily .
they now have a lot of explaining to do to the neighbors .
at least the feds are happy the show insisted that this is the first time in its 40-year-history that such an error has been made and tried to play down the gaffe .
apparently , they said , the feds are very pleased with the outcome .
well , that 's ok then .
" the fbi is glad it can give up on a lead it has been following for a year , " said the show 's spokeswoman , margit preiss , somewhat insensitively .
" the fbi simply gave us the photo and neither we nor the german investigators realized that the americans were looking for the right person with the wrong picture . "

the ferry , carrying more than 100 passengers , collided with another vessel in the buriganga river , near dhaka , and capsized .
several passengers swam ashore but others were feared trapped in the stricken boat .
bangladesh frequently sees ferry accidents - typically blamed on unsafe , ageing boats and on overcrowding .
some more bodies were found inside the ferry after it was pulled out of the water early on friday , police official asm maniruzzaman told the associated press news agency .
the ferry had been travelling from dhaka to the neighbouring town of taltata when it met with the accident .
unsafe passenger rina aktar and her 10-month-old son survived the accident , but her mother-in-law died .
" i huddled my baby and ran to the upper deck when the boat wobbled and started going down , ms aktar , said .
" the boy took in lot of water , but i 'm glad he is still alive . "
another survivor , farhana , said he jumped into the river as the boat started going down .
a recent study on ferry safety said that about 20,000 cargo and passenger vessels operate in bangladesh , and about half of them fail to meet basic safety standards , or take on more than their legal quota of passengers .
the study asked the government to strengthen coast guard patrols , identify dangerous river crossings , enforce registration requirements and provide training for navigators and crew .
the government says that measures are being taken to improve safety in the waterways .

the ferry , carrying more than 100 passengers , collided with another vessel in the buriganga river , near dhaka , and capsized .
several passengers swam ashore but others were feared trapped in the stricken boat .
bangladesh frequently sees ferry accidents - typically blamed on unsafe , ageing boats and on overcrowding .
some more bodies were found inside the ferry after it was pulled out of the water early on friday , police official asm maniruzzaman told the associated press news agency .
the ferry had been travelling from dhaka to the neighbouring town of taltata when it met with the accident .
unsafe passenger rina aktar and her 10-month-old son survived the accident , but her mother-in-law died .

" the boy took in lot of water , but i 'm glad he is still alive . "
another survivor , farhana , said he jumped into the river as the boat started going down .
a recent study on ferry safety said that about 20,000 cargo and passenger vessels operate in bangladesh , and about half of them fail to meet basic safety standards , or take on more than their legal quota of passengers .
the study asked the government to strengthen coast guard patrols , identify dangerous river crossings , enforce registration requirements and provide training for navigators and crew .

the welsh assembly government says it wants to see an " economic hub " of industry and tourism for anglesey and gwynedd based around the menai strait .
an estimated 1,500 jobs will be lost in the area when wylfa nuclear power station is decommissioned in 2010 .
north wales conservative am brynle williams welcomed the action plan but said : " it could do with being more . "
deputy minister for regeneration leighton andrews set out a programme for the area in partnership with the local authorities , educational institutions , private sector employers and the nuclear decommissioning agency .
the môn a menai programme was developed in october 2006 in response to the employment implications of the decommissioning of wylfa nuclear power station .
the plan aims to make the menai straits an ' economic hub ' anglesey and gwynedd councils have called for a 10-year regeneration strategy to offset the expected job losses from the closure of the ageing magnox nuclear reactor , which is one of the biggest employers on the island .
the action plan will also look at the development of the waterfronts in holyhead and caernarfon as well as improvements to bangor 's city centre .
it also aims to expand north wales ' outdoor pursuits sector , currently worth around £ 140m a year , as well as work with bangor university to turn research and development into commercial projects .
mr andrews said : " important challenges to the north west wales economy lie ahead .
' migrating ' " we are focusing on specific projects which can make a difference to the overall economy of môn a menai . "
gwynedd council leader richard parry-hughes said : " we will be working with our partners to ensure the wealth created in the proposed economic hub is spread out to the rims and the outskirts of both môn and gwynedd , which will be the test of its success . "
anglesey -lsb- ynys mon -rsb- council leader gareth winston roberts said the action plan was an " first important step towards regeneration in the region " and must " get to grips with the task in hand and continue to work to attract new jobs to the island and wider area " .
mr williams said the campaign to secure a replacement to wylfa , a so-called wylfa b , needed to be successful to avoid the " devastating effects on job prospects " for anglesey of the power station 's closure .
he said : " we need to stop our young people migrating from anglesey .
we need more investment on the north wales coast right through . "

even though they are not in power in the assembly - it 's their first conference as the " official opposition " and the party believes it will give them a springboard for taking more seats at may 's local council elections .
but there are real tensions within the party over the assembly group wanting more powers for wales .
" they want to go further than most of the party " as one source says .
but that is unlikely to break out into the open as the welsh conservatives present a united front .
the uk leader david cameron speaks on saturday - st david 's day - and in the afternoon assembly group leader nick bourne - it will be followed by a speech from the shadow defence secretary , liam fox , mp .
david cameron speaks at the conference on saturday another high profile speaker is the shadow security minister baroness pauline neville jones , a former career civil servant , who served for a time as chair of the joint intelligence committee .
a review of policy is already underway on enterprise and other reviews are likely to be announced on health and the environment , heritage , social justice and rural affairs - but no " rafts " of new policies .
" we are in a strong position , " said nick bourne .
" but we have to keep focusing to keep the momentum going , and presenting ourselves as a credible alternative to labour and plaid cymru in the welsh assembly government . "
in the may assembly elections the party won another seat - bringing their group number to 12 .
they also won the second highest number of votes , after labour and at 22.4 % a major share of the vote .
grumblings the welsh conservatives won 109 seats at the last local council elections in 2004 election and the party expects " significant gains " .
they have their sights set on councils like the vale of glamorgan , but it would be a huge task to gain many more authorities .
at the moment they only hold power outright in one - monmouthshire but share power in three others , denbighshire , bridgend and wrexham .
" at these elections we will be fighting in every local authority area in wales , which is a first , " said nick bourne .
and that includes fighting in areas like rhondda cynon taf and neath port talbot where they have no seats at all .

he was known as " chemical ali " for his role in alleged gas attacks on northern iraq , during the offensive against the kurds in 1988 .
he was convicted on 24 june 2007 of genocide in the so-called anfal campaign of 1988 and sentenced to death by hanging .
his execution was finally approved by iraq 's presidency in february 2008 , after a delay of several months because of legal wranglings .
as the iraqi president 's paternal cousin , he sat astride two pillars of the iraqi regime - saddam hussein 's extended family and the baath party .
before the fall of the regime , arab press reports cast him in the part of a family kingmaker , playing a significant role in the simmering rivalry for succession between saddam hussein 's sons , qusay and uday .
after several years without a ministerial position , al-majid left his behind-the-scenes role in the upper strata of the baath party as saddam hussein placed iraq on a war footing .
in march 2003 , he was appointed to head the southern region - one of four senior commanders reporting directly to the president .
a month later , british officials said they believed he had been killed in a coalition air strike in the southern city of basra .
but in june , us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld conceded that he did not know whether he was dead or alive .
two months later , us military officials announced that they had captured him .
kurdish offensive al-majid was appointed governor of northern iraq in march 1987 , marking the beginning of a sustained offensive , known as the " anfal campaign " , by iraqi troops against the kurdish population .
kurdish organisations describe the events which followed as genocide .
a decree signed by al-majid , dated 3 june 1987 , stated : " within their jurisdiction , the armed forces must kill any human being or animal present in these areas . "
human rights campaigners say the iraqi army then proceeded to kill tens of thousands of kurdish civilians in gas attacks and by summary execution .
' governor of kuwait ' iraq 's invasion of kuwait ended al-majid 's career in the north .
following the annexation of the gulf state in august 1990 he became effectively " governor " of what baghdad called " iraq 's 19th governorate " .
although he was replaced in that position in november 1990 , in march 1991 al-majid was promoted to minister of the interior .
the british pressure group indict accuses him of crimes against humanity for his role in suppressing the kurdish and shia-led uprising which broke out as iraqi troops fled kuwait .
after a period as defence minister from 1991 to 1995 , he was relieved of his ministerial duties .
however , he continued to hold important baath party posts , as a member of the ruling revolution command council and leader of the baath party in salah-al-din governorate , which included saddam hussein 's home town of tikrit .
family defectors al-majid 's position was threatened in 1995 , when two of his nephews , saddam hussein 's sons-in-law , hussein kamil al-majid and saddam kamil al-majid , defected to jordan with their families .
he then personally led the so-called " jihadi offensive " , which resulted in the murder of the two brothers , their father -lrb- his own brother -rrb- and several others for treason .
family feuds during peace time did not prevent saddam hussein from turning to trusted relatives for support in times of war .
renewed us and british bombing raids on iraq in december 1998 saw al-majid return to iraq 's sensitive border with kuwait .
he was appointed as commander of a newly-formed southern region - a role he would take up again in 2003 , as iraq once again prepared for war .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- pensions ' taking up ' council tax bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine 08:20 gmt , friday , 29 february 2008 pensions ' taking up ' council tax rises in council tax are being taken up by the rising bill for workers ' pensions , a campaign group says .
a report by the taxpayers ' alliance says spending on local government pensions rose 13 % last year to £ 4.6bn.
for every £ 5 in revenue raised by local authorities , more than £ 1 now goes to fund staff retirement , it says .
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- , which represents councils in england , insists that council workers deserve good pensions .
the local government pension scheme -lrb- lgps -rrb- is still being linked to final salary and allows many employees to retire early with full benefits .
taxpayers ' alliance chairman andrew allum said other parts of society were being hurt by the over-generous provision for council staff . "
this is a fair and affordable pension scheme for local government workers , which is also fair to taxpayers " department for communities and local government " it 's unacceptable that ordinary families and pensioners who struggle to pay inflated council tax bills see so much of their money spent on gold-plated council pensions that have all but disappeared in the wider economy , " mr allum said .
" the problem is clearly getting worse and requires urgent attention .
" councils should start correcting their own behaviour immediately and the government must face down union pressure and reform the outdated local government pensions scheme as soon as possible . "
the researchers used freedom of information laws to obtain copies of annual accounts from 98 % of councils in england and wales .
they found the average local authority spent £ 10m on pension contributions in 2006/07 - up 13 % on the previous year .
lga deputy chief executive john ransford said : " the taxpayers ' alliance appears to be condemning lollipop ladies , bin men , street cleaners and librarians for getting a pension worthy of the years of service they have given helping local people .
" the local government pension scheme recently underwent a radical overhaul , which provides greater value for money to the taxpayer while at the same time recognising the invaluable work that council staff do to make the lives of local people better . "
impending reform shadow local government secretary eric pickles said the government was " adding insult to injury by making hard-working families and hard-pressed pensioners pay towards the soaring cost of gold-plated town hall pensions " .
but the department for communities and local government said : " this is a fair and affordable pension scheme for local government workers , which is also fair to taxpayers . "
brian strutton , national officer of the gmb , said : " it 's a shame the taxpayers alliance did n't do their homework .
" they ask for a reform of local government pensions oblivious to the fact that a new scheme starts in april .

for every £ 5 in revenue raised by local authorities , more than £ 1 now goes to fund staff retirement , it says .
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- , which represents councils in england , insists that council workers deserve good pensions .
the local government pension scheme -lrb- lgps -rrb- is still being linked to final salary and allows many employees to retire early with full benefits .
taxpayers ' alliance chairman andrew allum said other parts of society were being hurt by the over-generous provision for council staff .
this is a fair and affordable pension scheme for local government workers , which is also fair to taxpayers department for communities and local government " it 's unacceptable that ordinary families and pensioners who struggle to pay inflated council tax bills see so much of their money spent on gold-plated council pensions that have all but disappeared in the wider economy , " mr allum said .
" the problem is clearly getting worse and requires urgent attention .
" councils should start correcting their own behaviour immediately and the government must face down union pressure and reform the outdated local government pensions scheme as soon as possible . "
the researchers used freedom of information laws to obtain copies of annual accounts from 98 % of councils in england and wales .
they found the average local authority spent £ 10m on pension contributions in 2006/07 - up 13 % on the previous year .
lga deputy chief executive john ransford said : " the taxpayers ' alliance appears to be condemning lollipop ladies , bin men , street cleaners and librarians for getting a pension worthy of the years of service they have given helping local people .
" the local government pension scheme recently underwent a radical overhaul , which provides greater value for money to the taxpayer while at the same time recognising the invaluable work that council staff do to make the lives of local people better . "
impending reform shadow local government secretary eric pickles said the government was " adding insult to injury by making hard-working families and hard-pressed pensioners pay towards the soaring cost of gold-plated town hall pensions " .
but the department for communities and local government said : " this is a fair and affordable pension scheme for local government workers , which is also fair to taxpayers . "
brian strutton , national officer of the gmb , said : " it 's a shame the taxpayers alliance did n't do their homework .
" they ask for a reform of local government pensions oblivious to the fact that a new scheme starts in april .
" all their facts - which are misrepresented anyway - are based on historic data from the old scheme .
" the new scheme from april will see councils paying less and council workers paying more . "
