" i only have four months left to work with the team , and i am going to enjoy them , " he said . captains pick munich to win munich are the top title favorite among players as well with 15 of the 18 team captains seeing them in front of bremen at the end of the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni has had a successful start to his bundesliga career bremen host lowly vfl bochum on sunday after losing their cup game 2-1 at borussia dortmund , but midfielder tim borowski is upbeat that his team , even with national team midfielder torsten frings out with another knee injury , is good enough for the title before he joins munich in summer .

" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .

with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .

canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .

average attendance in the top-flight bundesliga division was a best-ever 38,529 while second-division gates averaged 17,693 , up 10.83 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld left bayern once already in 2004 - he may take over the swiss national team the average price for a ticket to a bundesliga games costs 19.32 euros -lrb- $ 28.75 -rrb- .
according to consultants deloitte & touche , the bundesliga 's ticket prices are considerably lower than the england ' premier league -lrb- 51 euros -rrb- and spain 's primera division -lrb- 33 euros -rrb- . lots of new , untested players germany clubs were also busier than ever before in the january transfer window , with 50 new players joining the bundesliga as spending went above 48 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .
the increased instability has led to the eu suspending its plans to deploy a peacekeeping mission to the country and officials announced that no troops would be leaving for chad over the weekend .
no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .
" we do n't know exactly what the situation there is but today , we in paris will be more involved in gathering information than anything else .
there are no flights planned over the weekend .
we have decided to watch events in chad very closely and will take our decisions on a day-to-day basis . "

french bolster force in chadian capital de cussac said the advance party members of the european mission - including french , irish , austrian and italian troops - are not currently under threat .
" there is no risk because they are at the moment in the french camps , " he said .
the french government beefed up its military presence in the chadian capital on friday with a company of 150 soldiers from its garrison in libreville , gabon , to protect french nationals in n 'djamena .

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .

no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .

we have decided to watch events in chad very closely and will take our decisions on a day-to-day basis . "

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .

14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .

and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .
the increased instability has led to the eu suspending its plans to deploy a peacekeeping mission to the country and officials announced that no troops would be leaving for chad over the weekend .
no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .
" we do n't know exactly what the situation there is but today , we in paris will be more involved in gathering information than anything else .
there are no flights planned over the weekend .
we have decided to watch events in chad very closely and will take our decisions on a day-to-day basis . "
three flights , one with a dozen austrian soldiers and two with around 50 irish soldiers and equipment , were due to arrive in chad on friday but were cancelled due to the rebel 's advance on the capital .

french bolster force in chadian capital de cussac said the advance party members of the european mission - including french , irish , austrian and italian troops - are not currently under threat .
" there is no risk because they are at the moment in the french camps , " he said .
the french government beefed up its military presence in the chadian capital on friday with a company of 150 soldiers from its garrison in libreville , gabon , to protect french nationals in n 'djamena .
french defense minister herve morin said a military airbus was flying to the capital on saturday to fly out the expatriates , who include more than 1,000 french citizens .

but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .

" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .

" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .

canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .

and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .

renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .

motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week .

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week . " you can only do this sort of thing in berlin , " phillip wolff , hugo boss communications chief , told fashion reporters .
" what other city would let you take over a major airport for a fashion show ? " dw staff -lrb- dc / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .
us leads calls for more troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants more international help in its fight in a strongly-worded letter to defence minister franz josef jung , gates asked germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to afghanistan , with some deployed to the more dangerous south .

" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .

" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2008 petition to keep tempelhof airport gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers entering tempelhof are transported back in time the closure of berlin 's tempelhof airport later this year should have been a done deal .
but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .
the increased instability has led to the eu suspending its plans to deploy a peacekeeping mission to the country and officials announced that no troops would be leaving for chad over the weekend .
no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .

" there is no risk because they are at the moment in the french camps , " he said .
the french government beefed up its military presence in the chadian capital on friday with a company of 150 soldiers from its garrison in libreville , gabon , to protect french nationals in n 'djamena .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .
us leads calls for more troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants more international help in its fight in a strongly-worded letter to defence minister franz josef jung , gates asked germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to afghanistan , with some deployed to the more dangerous south .
with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .
gates warned that without reinforcements nato faced a loss of credibility and a division within the alliance , according to sources who have seen the letter .
nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .
" we have agreed on a clear division of labor , " jung said .
" i believe that we really need to keep our focus on the north . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer called us comments unhelpful de hoop scheffer described gates ' letter as " unhelpful , " a view shared by many german politicians .
" we need to do more but it does n't help to go public about this , " he said .
" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "
opposition greens party defence spokesman winfried nachtwei said the tone of the gates letter was a " relapse " into the era of former defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
" the german government should not allow itself to be blackmailed by a sinking us administration , " he said .
germany has been considering a nato request for combat troops for a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan to replace a 350- strong norwegian force that leaves in july .

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2008 petition to keep tempelhof airport gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers entering tempelhof are transported back in time the closure of berlin 's tempelhof airport later this year should have been a done deal .
but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week . " you can only do this sort of thing in berlin , " phillip wolff , hugo boss communications chief , told fashion reporters .

renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .
us leads calls for more troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants more international help in its fight in a strongly-worded letter to defence minister franz josef jung , gates asked germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to afghanistan , with some deployed to the more dangerous south .
with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .
gates warned that without reinforcements nato faced a loss of credibility and a division within the alliance , according to sources who have seen the letter .
nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .
" we have agreed on a clear division of labor , " jung said .
" i believe that we really need to keep our focus on the north . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer called us comments unhelpful de hoop scheffer described gates ' letter as " unhelpful , " a view shared by many german politicians .
" we need to do more but it does n't help to go public about this , " he said .
" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "
opposition greens party defence spokesman winfried nachtwei said the tone of the gates letter was a " relapse " into the era of former defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
" the german government should not allow itself to be blackmailed by a sinking us administration , " he said .
germany has been considering a nato request for combat troops for a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan to replace a 350- strong norwegian force that leaves in july .
government sources said the defence ministry would probably agree to the request . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .

with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .
gates warned that without reinforcements nato faced a loss of credibility and a division within the alliance , according to sources who have seen the letter .
nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .
" we have agreed on a clear division of labor , " jung said .

" we need to do more but it does n't help to go public about this , " he said .
" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "
opposition greens party defence spokesman winfried nachtwei said the tone of the gates letter was a " relapse " into the era of former defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
" the german government should not allow itself to be blackmailed by a sinking us administration , " he said .
germany has been considering a nato request for combat troops for a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan to replace a 350- strong norwegian force that leaves in july .

" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .

with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .

canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .

" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .
the increased instability has led to the eu suspending its plans to deploy a peacekeeping mission to the country and officials announced that no troops would be leaving for chad over the weekend .
no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .
" we do n't know exactly what the situation there is but today , we in paris will be more involved in gathering information than anything else .
there are no flights planned over the weekend .
we have decided to watch events in chad very closely and will take our decisions on a day-to-day basis . "
three flights , one with a dozen austrian soldiers and two with around 50 irish soldiers and equipment , were due to arrive in chad on friday but were cancelled due to the rebel 's advance on the capital .

force commanders expect the mission to be initially ready in march and fully up and running in may , with a total of some 3,700 european troops drawn from 14 nations , and france has provided more than 2,000 personnel in its former colony since 1986 .
french bolster force in chadian capital de cussac said the advance party members of the european mission - including french , irish , austrian and italian troops - are not currently under threat .
" there is no risk because they are at the moment in the french camps , " he said .
the french government beefed up its military presence in the chadian capital on friday with a company of 150 soldiers from its garrison in libreville , gabon , to protect french nationals in n 'djamena .
french defense minister herve morin said a military airbus was flying to the capital on saturday to fly out the expatriates , who include more than 1,000 french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has had to pull its staff out after attacks as another result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad .
the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns .
un condemns attempted rebellion the united nations rejected the use of force to topple the government in chad and condemned actions worsening the humanitarian situation , un secretary general ban ki-moon said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un condemns the attempts to overthrow deby ban said in a statement he was " deeply concerned " by the renewed fighting and reiterated the un 's " condemnation of the use of military means to seize power . "
" the secretary general calls on all parties to abide by their commitment under the different peace accords signed by them and to urgently resort to dialogue to reach a peaceful and negotiated settlement of this latest crisis , " the statement said .
the chadian government informed the un security council on thursday that it intended " to make use of the full range of means at its disposal , including hot pursuit of the aggressors , to exercise its right of self-defense against the aggression orchestrated and strongly supported by the sudan .

nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .
" we have agreed on a clear division of labor , " jung said .
" i believe that we really need to keep our focus on the north . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief de hoop scheffer called us comments unhelpful de hoop scheffer described gates ' letter as " unhelpful , " a view shared by many german politicians .
" we need to do more but it does n't help to go public about this , " he said .
" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "
opposition greens party defence spokesman winfried nachtwei said the tone of the gates letter was a " relapse " into the era of former defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
" the german government should not allow itself to be blackmailed by a sinking us administration , " he said .
germany has been considering a nato request for combat troops for a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan to replace a 350- strong norwegian force that leaves in july .
government sources said the defence ministry would probably agree to the request . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

witnesses described the rebels , in olive-green battledress and white armbands , as roaring around in camouflaged pick-up trucks while others had stormed the main prison in n 'djamena and released its inmates .
the increased instability has led to the eu suspending its plans to deploy a peacekeeping mission to the country and officials announced that no troops would be leaving for chad over the weekend .
no more eu peacekeepers in chad this weekend " it 's still very unstable " on the ground , lieutenant colonel philippe de cussac , spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told reporters .
" we do n't know exactly what the situation there is but today , we in paris will be more involved in gathering information than anything else .
there are no flights planned over the weekend .
we have decided to watch events in chad very closely and will take our decisions on a day-to-day basis . "
three flights , one with a dozen austrian soldiers and two with around 50 irish soldiers and equipment , were due to arrive in chad on friday but were cancelled due to the rebel 's advance on the capital .

force commanders expect the mission to be initially ready in march and fully up and running in may , with a total of some 3,700 european troops drawn from 14 nations , and france has provided more than 2,000 personnel in its former colony since 1986 .
french bolster force in chadian capital de cussac said the advance party members of the european mission - including french , irish , austrian and italian troops - are not currently under threat .
" there is no risk because they are at the moment in the french camps , " he said .
the french government beefed up its military presence in the chadian capital on friday with a company of 150 soldiers from its garrison in libreville , gabon , to protect french nationals in n 'djamena .
french defense minister herve morin said a military airbus was flying to the capital on saturday to fly out the expatriates , who include more than 1,000 french citizens .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .
us leads calls for more troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants more international help in its fight in a strongly-worded letter to defence minister franz josef jung , gates asked germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to afghanistan , with some deployed to the more dangerous south .
with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .
gates warned that without reinforcements nato faced a loss of credibility and a division within the alliance , according to sources who have seen the letter .
nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .
germany to concentrate on reconstruction jung rejected gates ' call for more combat troops to be sent to the south and said germany would continue to concentrate on its reconstruction efforts in the north .
" we have agreed on a clear division of labor , " jung said .
" i believe that we really need to keep our focus on the north . "

" we need to do more but it does n't help to go public about this , " he said .
" such an approach will conceal the gains we have already made in afghanistan . "
opposition greens party defence spokesman winfried nachtwei said the tone of the gates letter was a " relapse " into the era of former defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
" the german government should not allow itself to be blackmailed by a sinking us administration , " he said .
germany has been considering a nato request for combat troops for a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan to replace a 350- strong norwegian force that leaves in july .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .

with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2008 petition to keep tempelhof airport gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers entering tempelhof are transported back in time the closure of berlin 's tempelhof airport later this year should have been a done deal .
but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week . " you can only do this sort of thing in berlin , " phillip wolff , hugo boss communications chief , told fashion reporters .
" what other city would let you take over a major airport for a fashion show ? " dw staff -lrb- dc / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de historic berlin airport set to close in 2008 a german court has rejected a bid to prevent the closure of the capital 's imposing tempelhof airport .
berlin 's lifeline during the soviet blockade of the 1940s , the airport will now shut for good in october 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week . " you can only do this sort of thing in berlin , " phillip wolff , hugo boss communications chief , told fashion reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2008 petition to keep tempelhof airport gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers entering tempelhof are transported back in time the closure of berlin 's tempelhof airport later this year should have been a done deal .
but now that a public petition against the decision has been successful , the berlin government might have to hold a referedum . the people of berlin have long been saying that they do n't want to see tempelhof completely closed down .
according to surveys conducted by local media at the time of the court ruling on the airport 's future last year , around 75 percent of berliners want the airport to remain open , with only 22 percent in favor of a complete shut-down .
around 40 percent of residents said they would like to see the airport maintain some sort of business , for example in business or medical flights . and when the head of the berlin cdu , friedbert pflüger , called on berliners to sign a protest petition aimed at forcing the government to reverse its decision , they duly did so . by thursday , jan .
31 , the petition had received a total of 170,000 signatures - which , a fortnight before the feb .
14 deadline , is enough to justify a referendum . the city 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , recently said that the petition would not cause the government to rethink tempelhof 's closure .
experts agree that a referendum would not be legally binding and could not force the government to change its plans . this has prompted indignation from other local politicians who insist that a successful petition would leave the berlin city government duty bound to keep tempelhof open - at least until the city 's new main airport , berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- , is completed . ghostly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : june 1948 saw the beginning of tempelhof 's glory days - the berlin airlift , which lasted almost a year though still operational , tempelhof , berlin 's inner-city airport already has the aura of a ghost town .
its nazi-era architecture looms large at the southern edge of the city 's center .
and in the expansive entrance hall - with its imposing columns and polished floor - visitors can conjure up images of nearly forgotten days , when aviation was thrilling and heroic , and travelers dressed accordingly in their smartest clothes . heroism was at its most evident at tempelhof during the tense months of the berlin airlift , when allied pilots flew in food and supplies to sustain the population of west berlin when the soviets blockaded the enclave in 1948 . nowadays , the airport handles a handful of domestic flights as well as a shuttle to brussels - but even this modest business is due to cease in october when tempelhof will close for good .
the airport is to be replaced by the new bbi that 's being developed on the site currently occupied by schönefeld airport on berlin 's eastern outskirts . minister reopens debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is one of the best known examples of nazi-era architecture in the year that has passed since a local court rejected a bid to prevent tempelhof 's closure , it seemed that local politicians had accepted the airport 's fate . but in a testament to tempelhof 's emotional tug on berliners ' hearts , debate about its future was once again been stirred up , this time by ulrich junghanns , economics minister for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the neighboring state of brandenburg . he publicly wondered whether , after the closing date , small business flights might still be permitted to fly in and out of tempelhof .
surely that would n't compete in any meaningful way with business at the city 's new international airport ?
and besides , junghanns continued , the government has ignored the question of what should happen to tempelhof after october 2008 .
that 's a question , he said , that deserves to be discussed publicly . the minister 's comments reignited what was an extremely heated debate between berlin 's opposition cdu and the coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party members .
the cdu accused the coalition of " ignorance in destroying a valuable city asset - one with enormous economic potential . " the spd , however , maintains that the complete closure of tempelhof is necessary if the bbi project is to succeed .
brandenburg 's former social democratic state premier , manfred stolpe , reacted to junghanns ' comments saying : " if we want bbi , then we ca n't afford to play these games . " alternative uses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have already begun making proposals for future uses of the airstrip the cdu is already thinking of alternative uses for the historic airstrip , including proposals by foreign investors to turn it into an international health center with affiliated airport landing facilities .
pflüger said these plans would be worth 350 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- to the city and create more than 1,000 new jobs . proving that the airport could be re-tasked for any number of high-profile events , tempelhof is currently serving as one of the main catwalks at the 2008 berlin fashion week . " you can only do this sort of thing in berlin , " phillip wolff , hugo boss communications chief , told fashion reporters .

" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .

" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .

canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .

2 , increasing pressure on germany to deploy troops in the hostile south of the country where taliban insurgency is strongest . de hoop scheffer told bild am sonntag newspaper that germany should expand its military activities in afghanistan , a day after chancellor angela merkel 's government rejected calls by us defence secretary robert gates to do just that .
" germany plays a leading role in the north and is doing an exemplary job .
but i believe the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- could use more of this in other parts of afghanistan , " he said .
" i think all nations should show greater flexibility in the deployment of their forces , " de hoop scheffer said in an interview , excerpts of which were released in advance of publication sunday .
germany has around 3,200 soldiers serving with the 37,000-strong nato-led isaf .
most of them are engaged in training and reconstruction work in the relatively peaceful north .
under a mandate approved by parliament in october , germany can only send combat troops to the south under exceptional circumstances .
us leads calls for more troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants more international help in its fight in a strongly-worded letter to defence minister franz josef jung , gates asked germany to consider a new mandate which could allow thousands more troops to be sent to afghanistan , with some deployed to the more dangerous south .
with experts warning of more taliban attacks , washington wants the troops to replace the 3,200 marines it is sending to afghanistan to beef up the 26,000 us soldiers already stationed there .
the marines , though , are only supposed to stay for seven months at the most , after which other nato allies are expected to provide replacements .
gates warned that without reinforcements nato faced a loss of credibility and a division within the alliance , according to sources who have seen the letter .
nato allies at odds over deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are already in the cross-hairs the reluctance of allies like germany and france to make more troops available for a combat role has frustrated the us , canada , and other nato allies whose troops have been taking losses fighting the taliban and al qaeda .
canadian prime minister stephen harper issued a warning earlier this week that canada might end its military mission in the dangerous south unless other nato countries send more troops .
german politicians are reluctant to commit more forces amid growing concern among the population that the country could become a target for terrorists because of its involvement in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.02.2008 study claims women rising in far-right ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are gaining in importance in far-right ranks , a new study shows think of a neo-nazi and you think of a man with a shaved head , pummeling a foreigner .
but that image is outdated , some social researchers say .
she may well be a woman - and a feminist , to boot . at a recent conference of the friedrich ebert foundation in berlin , researchers examined the role of the sexes in the extreme right wing .
their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gdf 's logo is based on an ancient germanic symbol there are a wide range of approaches to combining these two roles , ranging from a strong identification to the mother-role to the creation of a so-called " national feminism . "
groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .
" this could mean that the women themselves are starting to see cooperation among women as an attractive thing in itself , " she said .
neo-nazi girls " just wanna have fun " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she looks like the girl next door - and she 's attending a neo-nazi rally .
one worker at a mobile youth clinic in ostprignitz , a depressed area of eastern germany , took a shot at explaining the attraction young women feel toward such right-wing groups .
" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .
outreach aimed mostly at men there is a long-held misconception that young women are either not part of the scene or are just " fellow travelers " with their truly active male counterparts .
this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .
" teachers are n't trained to deal with it , " she said .
" there are few examples in practice .
i think it is the area where there is a lot of need for information , where early intervention could help . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .

motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .

their findings : there may well be a preponderance of young male neo-nazis , but there are women in their ranks , too .
and they are gaining in importance .
renate bitzan , of the university of göttingen , has formed the research network on women and right-wing extremism .
her objective is to look into what sort of women join the far-right - and why .
" generally , it is not the image of women in the scene that draws women to be a part of it in the first place , " bitzan said .
" it is their ideology .
like the men , they are mainly attracted by ideas of togetherness , race and nation .
relations between the genders is of a lesser importance , so to speak . "
producing the pure race , and raising it right nonetheless , she said , women tend to be assigned certain roles .
and that is first and foremost that their job is to produce the purest possible offspring for the race , and raise them in the national spirit .
the woman 's second-most-important job is to take part in the political struggle , as a " comrade " to the men , bitzan said .

groups like the nationalistic , right-wing gemeinschaft deutscher frauen -lrb- organization of german women -rrb- promotes not only political activism but also strongly advocates motherhood and uses populist rhetoric .
on the other hand , groups like the mädelring thüringen -lrb- thüringen girl gang -rrb- exist to combat the patriarchy and political immaturity .
" today 's right-wing woman is not necessarily only the protector of hearth and home , but also an equal partner in creating a public life , which includes all areas of life and career equally , " bitzan said .
racist , nationalist - and feminist bitzan contends that this reflects a change of focus among right-wing women .
motherhood may still play a role , but independence , personal development , competency and challenging the patriarchy are more important .
but while the women may be exactly as racist , anti-semitic and nationalistic as their men , in keeping with gender clichés that also fit outside of the right-wing scene , they tend to leave violent public demonstrations to their men .
this does n't mean that women would never publicly demonstrate , bitzan said .
" most frequently , they are included in mixed-gender groups - parties , clubs , fellowships , " bitzan said .
some of them are members in right-wing women 's groups , which have seen a boom in the past years , the expert claims .

" the girls want to have fun , they are totally bored - especially in the countryside , " said the worker , who did not give her name .
" they are looking for something really attractive .
that is the far-right scene . "
as part of the far-right , the girls feel strong .
they can terrorize people , and have the feeling they are influencing society - the same thing that draws young men , the worker added .

this means outreach clinics and social workers are " overrepresented " in terms of being geared toward young men , said esther lehnert , a spokeswoman for the mobile outreach against right extremism in berlin .
she warned that young women need to be taken seriously .
one way to reach young women in the scene is to go through the schools , said gabi elverich , of the german youth institute in halle . but that is a hard nut to crack , because schools do n't deal with racism and discrimination at all , she said .

average attendance in the top-flight bundesliga division was a best-ever 38,529 while second-division gates averaged 17,693 , up 10.83 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld left bayern once already in 2004 - he may take over the swiss national team the average price for a ticket to a bundesliga games costs 19.32 euros -lrb- $ 28.75 -rrb- .
according to consultants deloitte & touche , the bundesliga 's ticket prices are considerably lower than the england ' premier league -lrb- 51 euros -rrb- and spain 's primera division -lrb- 33 euros -rrb- . lots of new , untested players germany clubs were also busier than ever before in the january transfer window , with 50 new players joining the bundesliga as spending went above 48 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
together with the summer transfers totaling almost 195 million euros , it takes the outlay on new players to a record 242.25 million euros for the bundesliga for a single season . but fans hoping for an immediate influx of international stars will be disappointed .
most teams have strengthened squads with young but largely untested players with an eye to the future . bayern , who splashed out some 70 million euros in the summer on big-name players such as luca toni and franck ribery , again wrote the biggest check - 12 million euros - to sao paulo for the young brazilian defender breno . czech striker and bundesliga old acquaintance jan koller has returned to germany 's nuremberg from monaco for 1 million euros . hitzfeld 's second farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borowski said he wants to beat bayern before joining them the second half of the season will also mark the last 17 games for bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who wants to bid farewell to german soccer - again - with another bundesliga title in may . munich used the hibernation period to select former germany coach and munich player jürgen klinsmann as hitzfeld 's replacement and on wednesday unveiled american martin vasquez as klinsmann 's assistant . bayern started superbly into the season , but then slumped in the closing stages of 2007 with just one win in their last seven games , with a mere four goals scored in the period and a six-point lead thrown away . general manager uli hoeness named the second half " breathtaking " and named the team fit for the three-title quest in the league , german cup and uefa cup . hitzfeld , however , warned that " we will need a few more games to be in our best shape , " but the coach maintained he was looking forward to finishing the season with bayern . " i only have four months left to work with the team , and i am going to enjoy them , " he said . captains pick munich to win munich are the top title favorite among players as well with 15 of the 18 team captains seeing them in front of bremen at the end of the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni has had a successful start to his bundesliga career bremen host lowly vfl bochum on sunday after losing their cup game 2-1 at borussia dortmund , but midfielder tim borowski is upbeat that his team , even with national team midfielder torsten frings out with another knee injury , is good enough for the title before he joins munich in summer .

ray gosling has presented hundreds of tv and radio documentaries i did n't want to be here - where i am .
it 's social care .
it says above the communal door that opens with an electronic tag we 've been given - " sheltered scheme " .
there are around 30 flats for people with special needs -lrb- built in 1984 and run by the guinness trust -rrb- - and i 'm here .
i did n't want to be .
how old am i ? 69 .
i was 60 when it happened - maybe 55 when it started .
and i was forced to be in here .
i used to have a house - a proper house i 'd lived in since i was 25 years old - in a quite posh hampstead-like suburb .
i 'd bought it for £ 3,000 in the 1960s and when it was sold it was worth £ 200,000 .
my partner and i had made that old big rickety house a home - and fairly grand , i suppose , by the end : a roof of rosemary tiles , a front room with a vaulted high ceiling , a marble fireplace , and original paintings by local artists .
when you 've established yourself in your 20s , you think your life will go on .
in your 30s it does , in your 40s it does , but what about in your 50s ?
series of misfortunes out of the blue my partner bryn went yellow in the street one lunch time and did n't feel well .
he went to the hospital where they said he had pancreatic cancer - and that is serious .
at the same time my work that had just gone on and on happily , richly , rewardingly , relentlessly - just stopped .
no fault of mine .
i also owed some back tax - about five grand - but he was dying .
i was trying hard to find new work and failing .
and he took a long time to die - two , three years . ... luckily , i 've always made big investments in the best bank in the world - the bank of friends i was made bankrupt .
then they came for the possession of the house -lrb- thankfully after my partner had died in the house we 'd built together -rrb- .
i was 60 years old , had gone through these terrible years - and age had taken its toll .
i was becoming beyond coherence with grief and bewilderment and anger some days .
communal lounge luckily - and this is a tip for those who 've just sailed through life so far - luckily , i 've always made big investments in the best bank in the world - the bank of friends .
so i was trolling along in town one day when i bumped into my old mate ken - a coal miner he 'd been .
we went into the pub , as you do , me feeling forlorn and he said , " come and see where i live now " .
i replied , " alright " .
ken lived in a red-brick , 1980s , three-storey block .
" it might suit you , you know , " he tentatively murmured .
i remember , as if it were yesterday , entering this block for the first time and walking with him through a communal lounge of high back chairs in which sat a blind lady , celia -lrb- she 's now my friend -rrb- and a wizen guy with a walking frame , john -lrb- he 's now my friend -rrb- .
i thought more sensibly : do n't be silly , ray .
you 've always been social - you might like the company .
did n't you run oap clubs yourself once ?
ken 's flat was quite nice : tiny , as you 'd expect a flat in a modern block to be , but it was warm -lrb- in my big old house we 'd never had central heating fitted -rrb- .
there was a warden who lives in , and every flat had a red cord to call her - or central control if she was off site .
but i walked out after my first visit thinking : i ca n't do this , at 60 i 'm not done - where is what i had ?
getting something back ?
the next day , when i woke up cold -lrb- still in my big house -rrb- , the interest on the bankruptcy clocking up like a london taxi meter , i thought more sensibly : do n't be silly , ray .
you 've always been social - you might like the company .
did n't you run oap clubs yourself once ?
acknowledge what you are now .
i 'm in some need .
i ca n't decorate / climb ladders / mend / repair / as i once could .
that 's all gone .
and i 've paid loads of taxes .
i 'm entitled to something back .
then the warden tells me there 's a ground-floor flat coming up vacant - do i want it ?
i thought : this chance may never come to me again .
so i asked my doctor to write a note of recommendation - thank you susan .
and being bankrupt and about to be evicted " earnt " me points .
and in i moved : slowly .
raise a glass i learnt to take part - oh yes , most sundays in the afternoon i 'll be there in a high back chair playing bingo , just for an hour or so .
at night time it 's quiet and yet surprisingly close to town .
throw a stone and you are on a main street with everything - there 's a convenience store two minutes walk away and five pubs near by .
i 'm a pig in clover .
so i raise a glass of thanks to lloyd george , william beveridge , aneurin bevan and the others who have brought about such a level of social care for so many .
and then i pour another glass to drink to myself for having the common sense - and courage - to accept .

but after a series of misfortunes , he found himself facing the reality of going into care .
ray gosling has presented hundreds of tv and radio documentaries i did n't want to be here - where i am .
it 's social care .
it says above the communal door that opens with an electronic tag we 've been given - " sheltered scheme " .
there are around 30 flats for people with special needs -lrb- built in 1984 and run by the guinness trust -rrb- - and i 'm here .
i did n't want to be .
how old am i ? 69 .
i was 60 when it happened - maybe 55 when it started .
and i was forced to be in here .
i used to have a house - a proper house i 'd lived in since i was 25 years old - in a quite posh hampstead-like suburb .
i 'd bought it for £ 3,000 in the 1960s and when it was sold it was worth £ 200,000 .
my partner and i had made that old big rickety house a home - and fairly grand , i suppose , by the end : a roof of rosemary tiles , a front room with a vaulted high ceiling , a marble fireplace , and original paintings by local artists .
when you 've established yourself in your 20s , you think your life will go on .
in your 30s it does , in your 40s it does , but what about in your 50s ?
series of misfortunes out of the blue my partner bryn went yellow in the street one lunch time and did n't feel well .
he went to the hospital where they said he had pancreatic cancer - and that is serious .
at the same time my work that had just gone on and on happily , richly , rewardingly , relentlessly - just stopped .
no fault of mine .
i also owed some back tax - about five grand - but he was dying .
i was trying hard to find new work and failing .
and he took a long time to die - two , three years . ... luckily , i 've always made big investments in the best bank in the world - the bank of friends i was made bankrupt .
then they came for the possession of the house -lrb- thankfully after my partner had died in the house we 'd built together -rrb- .
i was 60 years old , had gone through these terrible years - and age had taken its toll .
i was becoming beyond coherence with grief and bewilderment and anger some days .
communal lounge luckily - and this is a tip for those who 've just sailed through life so far - luckily , i 've always made big investments in the best bank in the world - the bank of friends .
so i was trolling along in town one day when i bumped into my old mate ken - a coal miner he 'd been .
we went into the pub , as you do , me feeling forlorn and he said , " come and see where i live now " .
i replied , " alright " .
ken lived in a red-brick , 1980s , three-storey block .
" it might suit you , you know , " he tentatively murmured .
i remember , as if it were yesterday , entering this block for the first time and walking with him through a communal lounge of high back chairs in which sat a blind lady , celia -lrb- she 's now my friend -rrb- and a wizen guy with a walking frame , john -lrb- he 's now my friend -rrb- .
i thought more sensibly : do n't be silly , ray .
you 've always been social - you might like the company .
did n't you run oap clubs yourself once ?
ken 's flat was quite nice : tiny , as you 'd expect a flat in a modern block to be , but it was warm -lrb- in my big old house we 'd never had central heating fitted -rrb- .
there was a warden who lives in , and every flat had a red cord to call her - or central control if she was off site .
but i walked out after my first visit thinking : i ca n't do this , at 60 i 'm not done - where is what i had ?
getting something back ?
the next day , when i woke up cold -lrb- still in my big house -rrb- , the interest on the bankruptcy clocking up like a london taxi meter , i thought more sensibly : do n't be silly , ray .
you 've always been social - you might like the company .
did n't you run oap clubs yourself once ?
acknowledge what you are now .
i 'm in some need .
i ca n't decorate / climb ladders / mend / repair / as i once could .
that 's all gone .
and i 've paid loads of taxes .
i 'm entitled to something back .
then the warden tells me there 's a ground-floor flat coming up vacant - do i want it ?
i thought : this chance may never come to me again .
so i asked my doctor to write a note of recommendation - thank you susan .
and being bankrupt and about to be evicted " earnt " me points .
and in i moved : slowly .
raise a glass i learnt to take part - oh yes , most sundays in the afternoon i 'll be there in a high back chair playing bingo , just for an hour or so .
at night time it 's quiet and yet surprisingly close to town .
throw a stone and you are on a main street with everything - there 's a convenience store two minutes walk away and five pubs near by .
i 'm a pig in clover .
so i raise a glass of thanks to lloyd george , william beveridge , aneurin bevan and the others who have brought about such a level of social care for so many .

around 120 restaurants in flintshire are being given the chance to try out the new salt cellars , which have only five holes in the top .
the initiative comes from flintshire council 's trading standards officers , and coincides with salt awareness week .
health experts say adults should eat no more than 6g a day - around a teaspoon .
" nationally , on average we are all consuming 9g of salt every day which is far too high , " explained ron hughes , head of flintshire trading standards .
" research has shown that salt added to takeaway meals such as fish and chips can be up to 3g - half the daily intake .
we 've had a very positive response from those taking up the offer .
they know their customers are benefiting ron hughes , flintshire trading standards " in flintshire we estimate there are over one million fish and chips meals sold every year and we want to work with takeaways to try and introduce a new healthier salt shaker which dispenses less salt . "
while traditional chip shop salt cellars have around 17 holes in their top , the healthy option has five .
" what it means is that if people want more salt on their chips , it will mean more shakes , but in general we find that does n't happen , " added mr hughes .
benefits the council has written to every takeaway restaurant in the county encouraging them to use the new shakers , and has provided some free of charge to fish and chip shops .
" we wanted to target the fish and chip shops first , because that is obviously where the salt shakers get used the most , " said mr hughes .
" we 've had a very positive response from those taking up the offer .
they know their customers are benefiting . "
the scheme coincides with national salt awareness week , highlighting the health issues around consuming too much salt .
experts estimate that by reducing salt intake to the recommended levels deaths from strokes could be cut by 24 % and from coronary heart disease by 18 % .
