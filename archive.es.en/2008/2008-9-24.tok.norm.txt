but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.09.2008 germany seeks organ donors with new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many germans have the organ donor id card two-thirds of germans say they want to donate their organs in the event of their death .
but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europe-wide organ donor card aims to slash death rates more than 3,500 eu citizens died last year because they did not get a donor organ in time .
now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem .
-lrb- 26.04.2008 -rrb- dutch tv hoax boosts organ donation a reality tv stunt condemned as sick and unethical around the world may have actually achieved its aims .

24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .
they have not been badly treated , " he said . " we are going to continue our efforts to release the hostages and we will do that until this unfortunate incident is completely resolved . "
" this is an act of banditry , not of terrorism , " the egyptian tourism ministry said in a statement monday .
egypt has witnessed a number of deadly attacks in recent years targeting foreigners at major tourist sites which have been blamed on al qaeda and other islamist militants .
the most recent attacks occurred between 2004 and 2006 in popular red sea resorts in the sinai . dw staff -lrb- dm / sp / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .

24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .
they have not been badly treated , " he said . " we are going to continue our efforts to release the hostages and we will do that until this unfortunate incident is completely resolved . "
" this is an act of banditry , not of terrorism , " the egyptian tourism ministry said in a statement monday .
egypt has witnessed a number of deadly attacks in recent years targeting foreigners at major tourist sites which have been blamed on al qaeda and other islamist militants .
the most recent attacks occurred between 2004 and 2006 in popular red sea resorts in the sinai . dw staff -lrb- dm / sp / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .
economy relies on seal products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenland 's population is made up mostly of inuits greenland , an autonomous danish territory of only 57,000 residents , including 50,000 inuits , however also relies heavily on seal hunting , counting some 2,300 professional hunters and about 6,500 recreational hunters .
in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .
public opinion " does not distinguish between canadian and greenlandic hunters , something we noticed in the 1980s , " the island 's former deputy prime minister josef motzfeldt lamented to reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu proposes partial ban on seal products the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .

in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 24.09.2008 lufthansa could benefit from european airline uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergers and takeovers are poised to take off in the european airline market as european airlines suffer from rising fuel prices , experts have said larger carriers , including germany 's lufthansa , could benefit from the industry 's consolidation . italy 's embattled airline alitalia is in desperate need of a buyer - or at least a potential buyer - before thursday , sept .
25 , or it may lose its operating license . the dire situation led the company to take out advertisements in european newspapers tuesday looking for buyers after earlier talks with italian air company consortium failed last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia may be on its way out the rome-based airline has n't made a profit since 1999 and is losing approximately 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- per day .
but italian politicians , who had been predicting there was little chance of a buyer appearing to save alitalia , started to sound more upbeat on wednesday . " it 's too much to talk about optimism , but you could say hopes have been revived , " said transport minister altero matteoli after italian media reported renewed interest from lufthansa as well as venezuelan carrier aserca . lufthansa 's expanding interests when it comes to european airlines looking for deep-pocketed partners , alitalia is n't alone .
though neither scandinavian airlines -lrb- sas -rrb- nor austrian airlines is quite as desperate as their italian counterparts , they 're both reportedly looking for partners . germany 's lufthansa has been rumored to be a favorite merger partner for both carriers after having taken over at brussels airlines earlier this month .
the company 's supervisory board is slated to meet on wednesday amid reports discussions will cover takeover candidates on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa could become the new boss for additional european carriers a takeover at sas or austrian airlines would bring lufthansa closer to market leader air france-klm .
the french-dutch alliance sold 203 billion kilometers worth of tickets , followed by lufthansa 's 147 billion , according to the international air transport association . small airlines the first to go the global financial crisis , rising fuel prices and the international economic downturn has hit airlines ' profits hard as fewer people travel .
airlines without a solid economic basis will be the first to go , according to ulrich horstmann , an aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank " trends are pointing toward larger airlines , " he said , adding that bigger carriers like lufthansa , british airways and air france-klm are likely to profit .
" smaller carriers are going to disappear from the market . " for its part , lufthansa is keeping quiet on its merger plans , but horstmann said additional takeovers , including of alitalia , were a possibility - if the conditions were right . but it may be too late for anyone to consider taking over at alitalia , according to bhf bank analyst nils machemehl .

dortmund officials issued an apology to hopp .
the dfb said in a statement that the criminal investigation in this case was sufficient , but that it will conduct its own probes in the case of future incidents in order to protect hopp .
" it is no longer enough to call for fairness towards dietmar hopp as some of the spectators have not changed their behavior , " said dfb vice-president rainer koch in the statement .
hopp said tuesday he would press charges against the borussia dortmund fan who was arrested for displaying the banner threatening to kill him .
a teenage dortmund supporter was arrested for holding up a poster showing hopp 's face in a crosshair under the message " hasta la vista hopp ! " at the carl-benz stadium on sunday before hoffenheim 's home win .
police arrested a 19-year-old man from halbstadt in the central german state of saxony-anhalt before kick-off .
german tabloid bild also reported the fan hurled the insult " son of a whore " at hopp .
hopp to press charges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp -lrb- r . -rrb- has become a hate figure in the bundesliga " we will press charges , " hopp , a multi-millionaire , told bild .
" a murder threat is not anything to be taken lightly .
this is not something you can ignore and it is important to send out a clear signal that a line has been crossed . "
hopp 's lawyer is looking into whether to also launch a civil prosecution against the teenager .
" it is not clear yet whether we can also file a complaint under civil law , " hopp 's lawyer dr johannes knorz told bild .
" however , we will press charges because of the insults .
the ' whore ' insult was bad enough , but the crosshair on the poster went too far . "
" what happened was embarrassing , shameful and unbecoming , " dortmund 's managing director hans joachim watzke told the tabloid .
the club have said they will do anything they can to help the police investigation .
hoffenheim owner becoming a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp achieved his dream by getting hoffenheim into the bundesliga hopp was also insulted by borussia moenchengladbach fans on the second weekend of the season and the multi-millionaire rarely travels to hoffenheim 's away games .
and the dfb announced tuesday afternoon they will give hopp as much protection as they can and will keep a close eye on the behavior of fans in future games involving hoffenheim .
vice-president rainer koch said : " in future , the dfb will intervene for the protection of dietmar hopp and pursue any inappropriate behavior or menaces against him until the perpetrators are caught . "

germany currently has 44 police and civilian experts in afghanistan under the eu mission . the eupol mission will now have 120 german police officers and civil experts , instead of the 60 currently working there .
experts from 21 countries are taking part in the project , which began in 2007 to help the nation create a sustainable police force .
worsening security earlier this year , european union ministers decided to boost the size of the bloc 's police training mission in afghanistan to try to improve security in the face of mounting attacks on international forces by a resurgent taliban .
in a separate bilateral arrangement , the berlin foreign and interior ministries said germany would also boost a direct aid scheme for the afghanistan police . a german training school for police is to open next month in mazar-e-sharif in northern afghanistan .

" surveys showed business confidence weakened in germany , france and italy in september , fueling fears the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of us financial market turmoil spread . " situation in europe less acute " " but the situation we face here in europe is less acute and -lrb- eu -rrb- member states do not at this point consider that a us-style plan is needed , " almunia said in a speech to the european parliament . his words were echoed by jean-pierre jouyet , france 's secretary of state for european affairs , who was addressing european lawmakers on behalf of the presidency of the eu .
jouyet said that the financial system in europe remains stable . consequently , the eu " is not planning similar measures as those adopted by the us authorities , such as buying toxic assets , " he added . the head of the international monetary fund , frenchman dominique strauss-kahn said europe 's banks are less in danger than their us counterparts but they should still " prepare for the worst . " in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , strauss-kahn suggested the crisis was created by america . " we should not forget that first and foremost this is an american crisis ...
therefore the job of dealing with the crisis should be fulfilled first and foremost by the united states , " he said . losses mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of the treasury , paulson , left , and bernanke are the architects of the bailout the us congress is currently hotly debating an unprecedented $ 700billion program to buy up bad mortgage debts and related securities that have brought the banking system and the nation 's economy to the brink of ruin . " action by congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " bernanke said on the second day of congressional testimony aimed at persuading the us congress of the need for a vast bailout .
almunia on wednesday welcomed the initiative , but said the details of the proposal by us treasury secretary henry paulson " need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed . " the current financial turmoil , which was sparked by last year 's subprime mortgage crisis in the united states , has already led to disclosed global losses totaling more than 500 billion dollars - a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of a country like sweden , almunia noted . " and unfortunately , the final figure is considered to be larger still , " the commissioner added . however , unlike in the united states , only a handful of european banks have so far required a public bailout - among them britain 's northern rock and germany 's ikb .
european officials agree that lack of transparency on the financial markets is largely to blame .
but some have also pointed their fingers at greedy bankers and company bosses . new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia is calling for more regulations the eu 's executive body , the commission , will over the coming weeks unveil a series of proposals aimed at improving the rules that govern financial markets and institutions .
these include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu . " delivering improvements in financial market regulation ... is more urgent than ever , " almunia said . the commissioner also told the european parliament that eu finance ministers plan to discuss what to do about the excessively high bonuses and severance pay earned by some european ceos at a meeting scheduled for october 6-7 . fbi investigates banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi is looking into possible criminal activity by 26 companies meanwhile , the federal bureau of investigation is examining possible criminal activity at 26 companies including recent bailout recipients fannie mae , freddie mac and american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- , according to media reports . major investment bank lehman brothers , which declared bankruptcy last week , is also on the list of firms in the fbi 's probe of accounting and other possible irregularities , the bloomberg financial news agency reported late tuesday , citing a senior law enforcement official . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .
economy relies on seal products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenland 's population is made up mostly of inuits greenland , an autonomous danish territory of only 57,000 residents , including 50,000 inuits , however also relies heavily on seal hunting , counting some 2,300 professional hunters and about 6,500 recreational hunters .
in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .
public opinion " does not distinguish between canadian and greenlandic hunters , something we noticed in the 1980s , " the island 's former deputy prime minister josef motzfeldt lamented to reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 24.09.2008 european hostages still held in egypt ; kidnappers unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group was seized in a remote egyptian region marked by barren and rugged terrain conflicting reports on the identity of the group that kidnapped 11 european tourists and eight egyptians in egypt 's western desert on friday continued to circulate wednesday , sept .
24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .
they have not been badly treated , " he said . " we are going to continue our efforts to release the hostages and we will do that until this unfortunate incident is completely resolved . "

" surveys showed business confidence weakened in germany , france and italy in september , fueling fears the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of us financial market turmoil spread . " situation in europe less acute " " but the situation we face here in europe is less acute and -lrb- eu -rrb- member states do not at this point consider that a us-style plan is needed , " almunia said in a speech to the european parliament . his words were echoed by jean-pierre jouyet , france 's secretary of state for european affairs , who was addressing european lawmakers on behalf of the presidency of the eu .
jouyet said that the financial system in europe remains stable . consequently , the eu " is not planning similar measures as those adopted by the us authorities , such as buying toxic assets , " he added . the head of the international monetary fund , frenchman dominique strauss-kahn said europe 's banks are less in danger than their us counterparts but they should still " prepare for the worst . " in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , strauss-kahn suggested the crisis was created by america .

" action by congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " bernanke said on the second day of congressional testimony aimed at persuading the us congress of the need for a vast bailout .
almunia on wednesday welcomed the initiative , but said the details of the proposal by us treasury secretary henry paulson " need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed . " the current financial turmoil , which was sparked by last year 's subprime mortgage crisis in the united states , has already led to disclosed global losses totaling more than 500 billion dollars - a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of a country like sweden , almunia noted . " and unfortunately , the final figure is considered to be larger still , " the commissioner added . however , unlike in the united states , only a handful of european banks have so far required a public bailout - among them britain 's northern rock and germany 's ikb .
european officials agree that lack of transparency on the financial markets is largely to blame .

these include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu . " delivering improvements in financial market regulation ... is more urgent than ever , " almunia said . the commissioner also told the european parliament that eu finance ministers plan to discuss what to do about the excessively high bonuses and severance pay earned by some european ceos at a meeting scheduled for october 6-7 . fbi investigates banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi is looking into possible criminal activity by 26 companies meanwhile , the federal bureau of investigation is examining possible criminal activity at 26 companies including recent bailout recipients fannie mae , freddie mac and american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- , according to media reports . major investment bank lehman brothers , which declared bankruptcy last week , is also on the list of firms in the fbi 's probe of accounting and other possible irregularities , the bloomberg financial news agency reported late tuesday , citing a senior law enforcement official . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a separate bilateral arrangement , the berlin foreign and interior ministries said germany would also boost a direct aid scheme for the afghanistan police . a german training school for police is to open next month in mazar-e-sharif in northern afghanistan .

1 .
wilhelm says the eu mission will include at least 200 observers from the 27-nation european union .
the german ambassador in beirut hansjoerg haber has already been appointed to head the mission .
talks on georgia in october meanwhile , the european union 's top diplomat said high-level international talks on the georgian-russian war are set to start in geneva on october 15 . after a meeting between european union foreign ministers and their russian counterpart in new york , eu foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the two sides agreed to “ a meeting , most probably on october 15 , on expert level first . " that decision appears to overturn the september 15 announcement by french foreign minister bernard kouchner - current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency at foreign-ministerial level - that the talks would not be held on october 15 because the eu had already scheduled a summit for the same day . " we arranged -lrb- the peace talks -rrb- for october 15 ... that was a bit of a slip-up because there will be a -lrb- european -rrb- council -lrb- summit -rrb- .
so it will be a little bit later , " kouchner said after a meeting with eu counterparts . location of eu mission still unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first members of the eu observer mission have already arrived in georgia the peace talks were originally agreed between french president nicolas sarkozy and his russian and georgian counterparts during a whirlwind diplomatic tour on september 8 . the accord requires russia to withdraw all its troops from georgia - outside of abkhazia and south ossetia , which moscow considers to be independent countries - within 10 days of the deployment of the eu mission on october 1 . experts say ambiguity over where the eu team might go has been the key weakness in the deal , with some saying the bloc could be accused of consolidating russia 's hold over the regions by not deploying there . the european union wants its monitors to be deployed also within abkhazia and south ossetia , but russia is firmly opposed to such a move . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , or it may lose its operating license . the dire situation led the company to take out advertisements in european newspapers tuesday looking for buyers after earlier talks with italian air company consortium failed last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia may be on its way out the rome-based airline has n't made a profit since 1999 and is losing approximately 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- per day .
but italian politicians , who had been predicting there was little chance of a buyer appearing to save alitalia , started to sound more upbeat on wednesday . " it 's too much to talk about optimism , but you could say hopes have been revived , " said transport minister altero matteoli after italian media reported renewed interest from lufthansa as well as venezuelan carrier aserca . lufthansa 's expanding interests when it comes to european airlines looking for deep-pocketed partners , alitalia is n't alone .
though neither scandinavian airlines -lrb- sas -rrb- nor austrian airlines is quite as desperate as their italian counterparts , they 're both reportedly looking for partners . germany 's lufthansa has been rumored to be a favorite merger partner for both carriers after having taken over at brussels airlines earlier this month .
the company 's supervisory board is slated to meet on wednesday amid reports discussions will cover takeover candidates on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa could become the new boss for additional european carriers a takeover at sas or austrian airlines would bring lufthansa closer to market leader air france-klm .

the text above a picture read , " why ? " ten people were killed when 22-year-old matti s. opened fire on fellow students at a vocational college in western finland on tuesday before turning the gun on himself .
he later died at the hospital . the shooting in the town of kauhajoki , some 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital helsinki , caused panic as the hooded gunman , identified by police as second-year culinary arts student matti s. , 22 , entered the school and began firing in a classroom where students were taking exams . small-caliber guns enough to kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police vehicles rushed to the school after news of the shooting was reported police said on wednesday they believed matti s. planned the massacre since 2002 and acted alone .

" police reached him on monday and asked him to be interviewed regarding the shooting video , " holmlund said .
" police action will be examined in more detail later .

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.09.2008 eu threatens italy with legal action over immigration package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's ideas for solving his immigration problems have angered the eu italy drew the ire of the european commission over its decree which would allow the automatic expulsion of other european union citizens condemned to more than two years of jail there . the commission on tuesday , sept .
23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .

the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .

in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .

in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , with a picture of a woman adding a candle to a memorial in front of the school .
the text above a picture read , " why ? " ten people were killed when 22-year-old matti s. opened fire on fellow students at a vocational college in western finland on tuesday before turning the gun on himself .
he later died at the hospital . the shooting in the town of kauhajoki , some 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital helsinki , caused panic as the hooded gunman , identified by police as second-year culinary arts student matti s. , 22 , entered the school and began firing in a classroom where students were taking exams . small-caliber guns enough to kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police vehicles rushed to the school after news of the shooting was reported police said on wednesday they believed matti s. planned the massacre since 2002 and acted alone . " a cold-blooded shooter entered the building with an automatic pistol and started cutting down students , " said jukka forsberg , a maintenance man at the kauhajoki school .
" he also shot towards me , he did not say anything and once the bullets started to whizz by i started running for my life . " prime minister matti vanhanen said on tuesday that finland , which has one of the world 'd highest levels of gun ownership , should consider banning private handguns altogether . " the kauhajoki shooter had a new gun permit for a small-caliber gun .
those calibers were enough , however , to end the lives of many young people and spread senseless pain and destruction widely , " helsingin sanomat wrote . online video of gunman finnish interior minister anne holmlund told a news conference that finnish police had spoken to the gunman a day before he carried out the attack because of a video he had posted on the internet video site youtube . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish press focused on the fact that police had contacted matti s. before the shooting the video , which has since been removed , showed matti s. wielding a handgun at a shooting range . " police reached him on monday and asked him to be interviewed regarding the shooting video , " holmlund said .
" police action will be examined in more detail later .
the gunman had a temporary permit for a .22 caliber pistol , and he had received it in august 2008 .
it was his first gun . " fire broke out at school a fire brigade duty officer said a fire had been started in several locations around the school . there were some 200 students in the building at the trade school where the shooting was reported , yle said . in november 2007 , a finnish high school student killed eight people in a school shooting before killing himself . the november shooting at jokela , 60 kilometers north of helsinki , triggered a series of threats against schools in finland and its nordic neighbors . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .

in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .
economy relies on seal products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenland 's population is made up mostly of inuits greenland , an autonomous danish territory of only 57,000 residents , including 50,000 inuits , however also relies heavily on seal hunting , counting some 2,300 professional hunters and about 6,500 recreational hunters .
in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 24.09.2008 lufthansa could benefit from european airline uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergers and takeovers are poised to take off in the european airline market as european airlines suffer from rising fuel prices , experts have said larger carriers , including germany 's lufthansa , could benefit from the industry 's consolidation . italy 's embattled airline alitalia is in desperate need of a buyer - or at least a potential buyer - before thursday , sept .
25 , or it may lose its operating license . the dire situation led the company to take out advertisements in european newspapers tuesday looking for buyers after earlier talks with italian air company consortium failed last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia may be on its way out the rome-based airline has n't made a profit since 1999 and is losing approximately 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- per day .
but italian politicians , who had been predicting there was little chance of a buyer appearing to save alitalia , started to sound more upbeat on wednesday . " it 's too much to talk about optimism , but you could say hopes have been revived , " said transport minister altero matteoli after italian media reported renewed interest from lufthansa as well as venezuelan carrier aserca . lufthansa 's expanding interests when it comes to european airlines looking for deep-pocketed partners , alitalia is n't alone .
though neither scandinavian airlines -lrb- sas -rrb- nor austrian airlines is quite as desperate as their italian counterparts , they 're both reportedly looking for partners . germany 's lufthansa has been rumored to be a favorite merger partner for both carriers after having taken over at brussels airlines earlier this month .
the company 's supervisory board is slated to meet on wednesday amid reports discussions will cover takeover candidates on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa could become the new boss for additional european carriers a takeover at sas or austrian airlines would bring lufthansa closer to market leader air france-klm .
the french-dutch alliance sold 203 billion kilometers worth of tickets , followed by lufthansa 's 147 billion , according to the international air transport association . small airlines the first to go the global financial crisis , rising fuel prices and the international economic downturn has hit airlines ' profits hard as fewer people travel .
airlines without a solid economic basis will be the first to go , according to ulrich horstmann , an aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank " trends are pointing toward larger airlines , " he said , adding that bigger carriers like lufthansa , british airways and air france-klm are likely to profit .
" smaller carriers are going to disappear from the market . " for its part , lufthansa is keeping quiet on its merger plans , but horstmann said additional takeovers , including of alitalia , were a possibility - if the conditions were right . but it may be too late for anyone to consider taking over at alitalia , according to bhf bank analyst nils machemehl .

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .
violence flares before , during and after rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftists fought running battles and burning trash but the violence of the previous night which had seen a far-right official shoved and punched and a river cruise boat pelted with stones after the rightists hired it as a venue for a news conference , erupted again on saturday when the radical left fought running battles attacks with the police and carried out more destruction of public property .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .
economy relies on seal products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenland 's population is made up mostly of inuits greenland , an autonomous danish territory of only 57,000 residents , including 50,000 inuits , however also relies heavily on seal hunting , counting some 2,300 professional hunters and about 6,500 recreational hunters .
in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .
public opinion " does not distinguish between canadian and greenlandic hunters , something we noticed in the 1980s , " the island 's former deputy prime minister josef motzfeldt lamented to reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , or it may lose its operating license . the dire situation led the company to take out advertisements in european newspapers tuesday looking for buyers after earlier talks with italian air company consortium failed last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia may be on its way out the rome-based airline has n't made a profit since 1999 and is losing approximately 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- per day .
but italian politicians , who had been predicting there was little chance of a buyer appearing to save alitalia , started to sound more upbeat on wednesday . " it 's too much to talk about optimism , but you could say hopes have been revived , " said transport minister altero matteoli after italian media reported renewed interest from lufthansa as well as venezuelan carrier aserca . lufthansa 's expanding interests when it comes to european airlines looking for deep-pocketed partners , alitalia is n't alone .
though neither scandinavian airlines -lrb- sas -rrb- nor austrian airlines is quite as desperate as their italian counterparts , they 're both reportedly looking for partners . germany 's lufthansa has been rumored to be a favorite merger partner for both carriers after having taken over at brussels airlines earlier this month .

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .
and that is one of the appeals that this conference is all about . interview : christina bergman -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union , the sister party to the country 's ruling christian democratic union , has held the state 's solo leadership since 1962 .
that 's time immemorial in the world of coalition politics .
now , polls show the csu could lose its absolute majority in the vote set for sunday , sept .
28 - meaning it would need to find a coalition partner in order to rule .
this could also signal a dwindling of support for the conservative camp in general and weaken chancellor angela merkel 's chances of retaining power in next year 's federal elections .
during the election campaign bavarian premier guenther beckstein and party chief erwin huber emphasized the party 's past successes and took an egalitarian approach to criticizing their opponents .
even the libertarian free democratic party , the party most likely to agree with the csu 's tax-cut program , was under attack .
according to several opinion polls , the csu 's support was hovering just below the 50-percent mark .
dw reporter michael lawton took an up-close-and-personal look at three of the issues that will help decide the fate of bavaria 's power party .
along the way , he asked a few key questions like : will dairy farmers stand by their politicians ?
why does a tiny town love its new mayor - a 23-year-old , openly gay member of the opposition ?
and what chance does anyone stand against the csu machine ?
to hear the answers , click on the links below . audios and videos on the topic can the csu count on dairy farmers ?
why bodenmais likes its unlikely mayor the unbearable lightness of being the csu feedback how will elections in bavaria turn out ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.09.2008 germany seeks organ donors with new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many germans have the organ donor id card two-thirds of germans say they want to donate their organs in the event of their death .
but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europe-wide organ donor card aims to slash death rates more than 3,500 eu citizens died last year because they did not get a donor organ in time .
now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem .
-lrb- 26.04.2008 -rrb- dutch tv hoax boosts organ donation a reality tv stunt condemned as sick and unethical around the world may have actually achieved its aims .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .
violence flares before , during and after rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftists fought running battles and burning trash but the violence of the previous night which had seen a far-right official shoved and punched and a river cruise boat pelted with stones after the rightists hired it as a venue for a news conference , erupted again on saturday when the radical left fought running battles attacks with the police and carried out more destruction of public property .

" surveys showed business confidence weakened in germany , france and italy in september , fueling fears the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of us financial market turmoil spread . " situation in europe less acute " " but the situation we face here in europe is less acute and -lrb- eu -rrb- member states do not at this point consider that a us-style plan is needed , " almunia said in a speech to the european parliament . his words were echoed by jean-pierre jouyet , france 's secretary of state for european affairs , who was addressing european lawmakers on behalf of the presidency of the eu .
jouyet said that the financial system in europe remains stable . consequently , the eu " is not planning similar measures as those adopted by the us authorities , such as buying toxic assets , " he added . the head of the international monetary fund , frenchman dominique strauss-kahn said europe 's banks are less in danger than their us counterparts but they should still " prepare for the worst . " in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , strauss-kahn suggested the crisis was created by america . " we should not forget that first and foremost this is an american crisis ...
therefore the job of dealing with the crisis should be fulfilled first and foremost by the united states , " he said . losses mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of the treasury , paulson , left , and bernanke are the architects of the bailout the us congress is currently hotly debating an unprecedented $ 700billion program to buy up bad mortgage debts and related securities that have brought the banking system and the nation 's economy to the brink of ruin . " action by congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " bernanke said on the second day of congressional testimony aimed at persuading the us congress of the need for a vast bailout .
almunia on wednesday welcomed the initiative , but said the details of the proposal by us treasury secretary henry paulson " need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed . " the current financial turmoil , which was sparked by last year 's subprime mortgage crisis in the united states , has already led to disclosed global losses totaling more than 500 billion dollars - a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of a country like sweden , almunia noted . " and unfortunately , the final figure is considered to be larger still , " the commissioner added . however , unlike in the united states , only a handful of european banks have so far required a public bailout - among them britain 's northern rock and germany 's ikb .
european officials agree that lack of transparency on the financial markets is largely to blame .
but some have also pointed their fingers at greedy bankers and company bosses . new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia is calling for more regulations the eu 's executive body , the commission , will over the coming weeks unveil a series of proposals aimed at improving the rules that govern financial markets and institutions .

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .
economy relies on seal products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenland 's population is made up mostly of inuits greenland , an autonomous danish territory of only 57,000 residents , including 50,000 inuits , however also relies heavily on seal hunting , counting some 2,300 professional hunters and about 6,500 recreational hunters .
in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .
public opinion " does not distinguish between canadian and greenlandic hunters , something we noticed in the 1980s , " the island 's former deputy prime minister josef motzfeldt lamented to reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .
" more than four million people visit our 21,500 pharmacies each day , " said magdalene linz , president of the federal council of pharmacists , adding that the health-consciousness of their customers and the ease of the application would help increase the number of organ donors .
germany still behind still , the new campaign does not go nearly as far in taking measures to broaden the donor pool as in other countries .
in the united states , applicants for a driver 's license or state id card are asked if they would like to become an organ donor , ensuring that most people have a chance to register .
some european countries , like holland , denmark , austria and spain , go even further , presuming consent from potential donors .
a similar " opt-out " system , which allow potential donors or their surviving relatives to reject donation but dispense with the prior release forms , is under consideration in britain .
in an effort to increase organ availability , the european parliament in april passed a measure instituting an organ donor card that could be recognized europe-wide , aimed at clearing up issues of consent when patients die abroad . the eu also set up an integrated organ bank that would broaden the pool of potential donors across europe . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .
violence flares before , during and after rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftists fought running battles and burning trash but the violence of the previous night which had seen a far-right official shoved and punched and a river cruise boat pelted with stones after the rightists hired it as a venue for a news conference , erupted again on saturday when the radical left fought running battles attacks with the police and carried out more destruction of public property .
some 3,000 police , drafted in to control the protests and seal off part of the old city , used truncheons and water hoses to fend off the violent " anti-fascist " leftist activists . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .
they have not been badly treated , " he said . " we are going to continue our efforts to release the hostages and we will do that until this unfortunate incident is completely resolved . "
" this is an act of banditry , not of terrorism , " the egyptian tourism ministry said in a statement monday .
egypt has witnessed a number of deadly attacks in recent years targeting foreigners at major tourist sites which have been blamed on al qaeda and other islamist militants .

the french-dutch alliance sold 203 billion kilometers worth of tickets , followed by lufthansa 's 147 billion , according to the international air transport association . small airlines the first to go the global financial crisis , rising fuel prices and the international economic downturn has hit airlines ' profits hard as fewer people travel .
airlines without a solid economic basis will be the first to go , according to ulrich horstmann , an aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank " trends are pointing toward larger airlines , " he said , adding that bigger carriers like lufthansa , british airways and air france-klm are likely to profit .
" smaller carriers are going to disappear from the market . " for its part , lufthansa is keeping quiet on its merger plans , but horstmann said additional takeovers , including of alitalia , were a possibility - if the conditions were right . but it may be too late for anyone to consider taking over at alitalia , according to bhf bank analyst nils machemehl . " no serious airline would save alitalia at this point , " he said , adding that while the italian market is of interest to lufthansa , " the price is n't right .

some experts are worried about eu-wide labor disputes if the union 's highest demand in 16 years is met . ig metall boss berthold huber told journalists in frankfurt on tuesday , sept .
23 , that the demand was justified in view of the robust state of the german economy and the uneven distribution of its benefits . " yes , 8 percent will hit profits , we are fully aware of that , " he said , warning that the current economic uncertainty should not detract from the fact that the metalworking industry is a major component of germany 's highly successful export machine . german trade unionists have long argued that while workers showed restraint through a long economic slowdown at the beginning of the decade , they have not seen any rewards for the upswing over the past two years . other branches watching current pay accords in the automobile , it and household goods industries expire on oct .
31 , so the outcome of ig metall 's negations with employers will be closely watched by all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kannegiesser called the union 's demands unrealistic but industry bosses have dismissed the union 's demand as unrealistic .
the president of the gesamtmetall employers association martin kannegiesser called german industrial workers the best paid in the world . the first round of negotiations starts on oct .
2 for workers in three of germany 's 16 states .
ig metall ruled out any industrial action before the end of next month . fears inflation to spiral norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth , " he said . european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet recently warned of the threat of a wage-price spiral and urged workers not to make high pay demands .
inflation has just begun to come off record highs , slipping to 3.8 percent in august from 4.0 percent in july . " high wage demands in germany will not make monetary policy easier for the ecb since they are -lrb- headed toward -rrb- reducing interest rates to support the ailing economy , " commerzbank analyst eckart tuchtfeld told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is concerned about higher wages pushing down buying power the 15-nation euro zone contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and is forecast to stagnate in the third , in which case it would just barely avoid a recession - defined as two quarters of negative growth . the 8-percent wage increase is well above german consumer inflation of around 3.3 percent on the year , due to on price hikes , increased productivity and strong profits in the sector . low wages , high profits unions and employers in germany negotiate wages sector by sector , and unions have become increasingly demanding after several years of moderate pay agreements that played a role in expanding germany 's economy faster than many of its neighbors . there have been several strikes this year , disrupting activity in the transport , postal and dairy sectors before higher pay was agreed to . according to the hans boeckler foundation , a research group with close ties to the unions , germany is the only european union member where inflation-adjusted salaries fell between 2000 and 2008 , by 0.8 percent . that has raised eyebrows across europe because it made the german economy more competitive , producing more goods at lower wage cost . a european commission calculation found that german wages would need to increase by 6 percent annually for several years to reach the level of other euro zone countries , according to a report in the german daily die zeit . " it is now our turn to profit , " ig metall 's huber said .
" the 8 percent should come from -lrb- corporate -rrb- profits , there is no question about it . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .
violence flares before , during and after rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftists fought running battles and burning trash but the violence of the previous night which had seen a far-right official shoved and punched and a river cruise boat pelted with stones after the rightists hired it as a venue for a news conference , erupted again on saturday when the radical left fought running battles attacks with the police and carried out more destruction of public property .
some 3,000 police , drafted in to control the protests and seal off part of the old city , used truncheons and water hoses to fend off the violent " anti-fascist " leftist activists . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .

and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .

in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .
but while they in theory should not be affected by a potential eu ban , they fear they could soon see their markets shrivel as they did 20 years ago when boycotts aimed especially at halting inhumane hunting practices targeting baby seals nearly wiped out the entire industry .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .
al maliki has warned against the migration of whole layers of the iraqi workforce that would be urgently necessary for the reconstruction of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .
" these same measures had been severely criticized as discriminatory and violating human rights law by the council of europe , civil society and indeed the commission itself , " a statement said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .

24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .
they have not been badly treated , " he said . " we are going to continue our efforts to release the hostages and we will do that until this unfortunate incident is completely resolved . "
" this is an act of banditry , not of terrorism , " the egyptian tourism ministry said in a statement monday .
egypt has witnessed a number of deadly attacks in recent years targeting foreigners at major tourist sites which have been blamed on al qaeda and other islamist militants .
the most recent attacks occurred between 2004 and 2006 in popular red sea resorts in the sinai . dw staff -lrb- dm / sp / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .

he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .

" this is a war against us and we ca n't accept that , " aqqaluk lynge , who heads up the greenlandic branch of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- , told reporters .
despite assurances that seal products certified to result from humane hunting techniques or from traditional hunting by inuits across the arctic region would be excluded from the proposed ban , the indigenous people of greenland still have major concerns that their livelihoods will once again be at stake .
" exemptions for inuits have not worked before , and the icc 's position is that exemptions will not work this time around either , " lynge told an international arctic conference in the western greenlandic town of ilulissat earlier this month .
while the proposed ban , put forward by the european commission in july , is mainly aimed at canada , where hunters this year were allowed to slaughter 275,000 seals , or nearly a third of the 900,000 seals hunted each year around the globe , the inuits rely heavily on their own seal trade to survive .

in 2006 , the last year for which numbers are available , 113,000 seals were killed off the shores of the island , which unlike denmark is not part of the eu .
greenland 's hunters are all inuits who , according to their representatives , do not kill seal pups and only kill adult seals with a virtually painless shot to the head .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 24.09.2008 european hostages still held in egypt ; kidnappers unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group was seized in a remote egyptian region marked by barren and rugged terrain conflicting reports on the identity of the group that kidnapped 11 european tourists and eight egyptians in egypt 's western desert on friday continued to circulate wednesday , sept .
24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .

24 . an egyptian government spokesman said the kidnappers were from djibouti , the london-based al-hayat newspaper reported . but other egyptian officials were being quoted as saying one of the kidnappers came from chad , while his three accomplices came from sudan . the al-jazeera news channel , meanwhile , quoted unnamed egyptian officials as having said the group was from chad .
an official at the sudanese foreign ministry said the kidnappers were all egyptians . the 19 went missing while visiting the remote scenic gilf kebir area close to egypt 's borders with libya , chad and sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , like his italian counterparts , denied ransom rumors five germans , five italians and a romanian were among them . various sources have been quoted in media reports as saying german and italian authorities were negotiating with the kidnappers . ransom negotiations denied but while the two governments have confirmed they are monitoring the situation , they have declined to confirm further conflicting reports of ongoing negotiations , reportedly involving a ransom demand of between $ 6 million and $ 15 million -lrb- 4-10.2 million euros -rrb- . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , speaking at the united nations general assembly in new york , declined to say whether the german government was involved in release negotiations . a spokesman for the italian embassy in cairo also declined to confirm the existence of negotiations .
sudanese authorities said on tuesday that they had located the hostages .
hostages located " they are now in an area of no-man 's land between the sudanese , libyan and egyptian border , in the area of jebel uweinat , " sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary mutrief sadiq told journalists in khartoum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region in southern egypt , bordering libya and sudan , where the tourists were seized " their position has been pinpointed and there is coordination between sudanese and egyptian authorities in this regard . " from our point of view the security of the hostages is the absolute priority - we do not want an operation that harms hostages , " sadiq said . asked whether an operation was being planned , he said : " we are coordinating . " the egyptian embassy in berlin had said four masked and armed men , believed to be mountain nomads , attacked and seized the four off-road vehicles in which the tourists were traveling while on a desert safari in egypt 's remote southwest .
hostages in " good health " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana said earlier tuesday that the group was in " very good health . "
" we have very sure and reliable information that everyone is fine .
they are in very good health and they have enough food and water .

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .

the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .
cologne police chief klaus steffenhagen said the police would look into these claims by the protestors , and suggested that the young people may have been held for a long time because their parents lived far away and were not aware of their youngsters ' participation in the demonstration .
the pro cologne rally , against plans to construct a grand mosque in the city and the general " islamification " of cologne , was supposed to take place on the old market square of heumarkt .
only 50 supporters of the far-right managed to reach the proposed site for the rally after some 5000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blockaded every entrance to the square .
violence flares before , during and after rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftists fought running battles and burning trash but the violence of the previous night which had seen a far-right official shoved and punched and a river cruise boat pelted with stones after the rightists hired it as a venue for a news conference , erupted again on saturday when the radical left fought running battles attacks with the police and carried out more destruction of public property .
some 3,000 police , drafted in to control the protests and seal off part of the old city , used truncheons and water hoses to fend off the violent " anti-fascist " leftist activists . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.09.2008 germany seeks organ donors with new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many germans have the organ donor id card two-thirds of germans say they want to donate their organs in the event of their death .
but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .
largest organ campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacists hope the campaign will boost the number of donors germany 's health minister ulla schmidt called it " the biggest campaign promoting organ donation that has ever been mounted in germany , " and said she was convinced it would significantly increase the number of card-carrying organ donors .
previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .

but they have n't yet done much to back it up .
a new pharmacy campaign aims to convince more in germany to register as donors . at any given time , around 12,000 critically ill germans are waiting for an organ transplant .
each day , three of them die .
that 's because there are n't enough organs - only around 4,000 on average are donated each year .
a recent poll by the leading german opinion research firm ipsos found that more than two-thirds of germans were willing to become organ donors .
but only 16 percent -lrb- about 13 million germans -rrb- actually have a donor identification card .
to help bridge this gap , the german health ministry has teamed up with the publisher of two free health magazines available at pharmacies in an unusual outreach campaign .
ten million organ donor card forms will be inserted into the magazines accompanied by articles emphasizing the need for organ donors , as well as assuring readers that their organs will only be taken in the event of their death .

previously , those in germany who wanted to become registered organ donors had to go to a health ministry web site and fill out the release form , which they could put in their wallet .
the chairman of germany 's foundation for organ donation , thomas beck , said wider distribution of the required form was urgent .
in the first six months of 2008 , 586 germans donated their organs after their deaths , 81 fewer than in the equivalent period in 2007 .

the police were confronted before , during and after the event - eventually abandoned on public safety grounds - by extreme leftists who attempted to reach the square during the planned rally by anti-immigrant group pro cologne .
der spiegel magazine alleged on its web site that hundreds of protestors , including 72 teenagers and three children , were taken to a detention center in the nearby town of bruehl , and some had to stay in open air cages despite the cold temperatures .
the protestors said about 30 of them were kept in a 36 square-meter -lrb- 388-square-foott -rrb- cage , and some of the teenagers were not allowed to call their parents or use the toilets , der spiegel online said , adding that a lot of them were not released until the early hours of sunday morning .

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .
and that is one of the appeals that this conference is all about . interview : christina bergman -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .
and that is one of the appeals that this conference is all about . interview : christina bergman -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

what worries you the most ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul heidemarie wieczorek-zeul : the thing that bothers me the most is the fact we have n't successfully reduced the mortality rate of mothers and that each year there are still 600,000 women , most of them in developing countries , who die from complications during pregnancy or birth .
infant mortality remains high too . every year , 10 million children won ’ t reach their fifth birthday .
so we will once again form a working group with the british government and the world bank aimed at channeling funds for the health system and for treatment and access to medical services . do you already have concrete ideas about how the federal government can contribute to that ? well we ’ re actively working on two aspects in this particular area .
in our advisory work with developing nations , we are continually asked about things like developing a basic social security network .
there are fewer traditional familes in developing nations too . so it ’ s important , for example , that health insurance systems are set up that keep people from falling into poverty when they become ill . the second thing is that we have an innovative finance instrument that we can use along with global funds to fight hiv , malaria and tuberculosis .
in effect we forgive a part of the debt of the developing nations , if they want , and they pay an amount equal to half of this forgiven debt into the global funds , so that really all three parties profit .
and an array of these “ debt swaps , ” as they are called , could be mobilized .
so from debt we get productive engagement and productive development for health . the big problem in acheiving the millennium development goals is africa .
why is that ? well i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that economic development and battling poverty has not made any headway , even though there is a large growth rate , because the markets are very small and partly because financial possibilities of the people aren ’ t used to their full advantage .
therefore , during our g8 presidency we always talked about how africa needs , certainly official development assistance , but it also needs direct investment , either from foreign entities or by mobilizing the nations own power .
and therefore the access to , for example micro financing , or the access to financing period is one of the things that really needs to be promoted .
so making finance work for africa and using the african development bank to do it .
that ’ s one important aspect .
the other is the lack of sufficient health systems and the lack of doctors and nurses that people can actually reach . there are eight millennium goals .
they ’ re supposed to be fulfilled by 2015 .
do you think that ’ s possible ? they have to .
they are eight commandments for the just formation of globalization .
and i ’ d like to make the numbers clear one more time .
if it ’ s possible to mobilize a $ 700 billion -lrb- 477 billion euro -rrb- rescue fund for the banking system in america , then it has to be possible to mobilize the billions required to save the world from hunger and poverty .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .

23 , threatened italy with legal action if it did not change the decree , which was part of a controversial package of measures against illegal immigrants and crime agreed by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet in may .
the security package included making illegal immigration an offense carrying a prison sentence and making the use of minors to beg for money a crime punishable with up to three years in jail - a measure which appeared to be aimed at roma people .
berlusconi 's cabinet announced the package after backlashes against illegal roma camps depicted by right-wingers in the prime minister 's new government as dens of criminality .
the eu said that italy had ignored its concerns that its proposals could fuel racism , saying that the decree " poses problems of compatibility with community law , in particular concerning the rules on the automatic expulsion of eu citizens , " according to a statement from eu justice and security commissioner jacques barrot .
the statement added that italy needed to clarify that the decree , which currently applies to all foreigners , would not be applied to eu citizens .
commission could take italy to court if italy does not agree to the change " the commission would launch infringement proceedings , " referring to a process that can lead the eu executive to take an eu member to court , barrot said in the statement .
the commission also asked italy to modify a draft decree setting conditions on how eu citizens can live in italy , including checks on their income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says the eu does n't have a problem with all decrees barrot said there were no problems with two other draft decrees that italy had submitted , concerning family reunification and procedures for recognizing refugee status .
the european commission controversially said earlier this month it had no problems with italian plans to fingerprint roma as it was satisfied italy would limit fingerprinting to cases where it was necessary due to a lack of documentation .
rights campaigners expressed concern last week about the european commission 's stance on italy 's controversial roma policy and urged brussels to release an italian report on the matter .
" the commission appears to have taken the narrowest possible view , accepting a ' softened ' version of the measures initially implemented by the italian government , " said the groups , led by amnesty international .

" surveys showed business confidence weakened in germany , france and italy in september , fueling fears the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of us financial market turmoil spread . " situation in europe less acute " " but the situation we face here in europe is less acute and -lrb- eu -rrb- member states do not at this point consider that a us-style plan is needed , " almunia said in a speech to the european parliament . his words were echoed by jean-pierre jouyet , france 's secretary of state for european affairs , who was addressing european lawmakers on behalf of the presidency of the eu .
jouyet said that the financial system in europe remains stable . consequently , the eu " is not planning similar measures as those adopted by the us authorities , such as buying toxic assets , " he added . the head of the international monetary fund , frenchman dominique strauss-kahn said europe 's banks are less in danger than their us counterparts but they should still " prepare for the worst . " in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , strauss-kahn suggested the crisis was created by america . " we should not forget that first and foremost this is an american crisis ...
therefore the job of dealing with the crisis should be fulfilled first and foremost by the united states , " he said . losses mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of the treasury , paulson , left , and bernanke are the architects of the bailout the us congress is currently hotly debating an unprecedented $ 700billion program to buy up bad mortgage debts and related securities that have brought the banking system and the nation 's economy to the brink of ruin . " action by congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " bernanke said on the second day of congressional testimony aimed at persuading the us congress of the need for a vast bailout .
almunia on wednesday welcomed the initiative , but said the details of the proposal by us treasury secretary henry paulson " need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed . " the current financial turmoil , which was sparked by last year 's subprime mortgage crisis in the united states , has already led to disclosed global losses totaling more than 500 billion dollars - a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of a country like sweden , almunia noted . " and unfortunately , the final figure is considered to be larger still , " the commissioner added . however , unlike in the united states , only a handful of european banks have so far required a public bailout - among them britain 's northern rock and germany 's ikb .
european officials agree that lack of transparency on the financial markets is largely to blame .
but some have also pointed their fingers at greedy bankers and company bosses . new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia is calling for more regulations the eu 's executive body , the commission , will over the coming weeks unveil a series of proposals aimed at improving the rules that govern financial markets and institutions .
these include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu . " delivering improvements in financial market regulation ... is more urgent than ever , " almunia said . the commissioner also told the european parliament that eu finance ministers plan to discuss what to do about the excessively high bonuses and severance pay earned by some european ceos at a meeting scheduled for october 6-7 . fbi investigates banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi is looking into possible criminal activity by 26 companies meanwhile , the federal bureau of investigation is examining possible criminal activity at 26 companies including recent bailout recipients fannie mae , freddie mac and american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- , according to media reports . major investment bank lehman brothers , which declared bankruptcy last week , is also on the list of firms in the fbi 's probe of accounting and other possible irregularities , the bloomberg financial news agency reported late tuesday , citing a senior law enforcement official . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" surveys showed business confidence weakened in germany , france and italy in september , fueling fears the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of us financial market turmoil spread . " situation in europe less acute " " but the situation we face here in europe is less acute and -lrb- eu -rrb- member states do not at this point consider that a us-style plan is needed , " almunia said in a speech to the european parliament . his words were echoed by jean-pierre jouyet , france 's secretary of state for european affairs , who was addressing european lawmakers on behalf of the presidency of the eu .
jouyet said that the financial system in europe remains stable . consequently , the eu " is not planning similar measures as those adopted by the us authorities , such as buying toxic assets , " he added . the head of the international monetary fund , frenchman dominique strauss-kahn said europe 's banks are less in danger than their us counterparts but they should still " prepare for the worst . " in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , strauss-kahn suggested the crisis was created by america . " we should not forget that first and foremost this is an american crisis ...
therefore the job of dealing with the crisis should be fulfilled first and foremost by the united states , " he said . losses mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of the treasury , paulson , left , and bernanke are the architects of the bailout the us congress is currently hotly debating an unprecedented $ 700billion program to buy up bad mortgage debts and related securities that have brought the banking system and the nation 's economy to the brink of ruin . " action by congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " bernanke said on the second day of congressional testimony aimed at persuading the us congress of the need for a vast bailout .
almunia on wednesday welcomed the initiative , but said the details of the proposal by us treasury secretary henry paulson " need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed . " the current financial turmoil , which was sparked by last year 's subprime mortgage crisis in the united states , has already led to disclosed global losses totaling more than 500 billion dollars - a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of a country like sweden , almunia noted . " and unfortunately , the final figure is considered to be larger still , " the commissioner added . however , unlike in the united states , only a handful of european banks have so far required a public bailout - among them britain 's northern rock and germany 's ikb .
european officials agree that lack of transparency on the financial markets is largely to blame .
but some have also pointed their fingers at greedy bankers and company bosses . new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia is calling for more regulations the eu 's executive body , the commission , will over the coming weeks unveil a series of proposals aimed at improving the rules that govern financial markets and institutions .
these include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu . " delivering improvements in financial market regulation ... is more urgent than ever , " almunia said . the commissioner also told the european parliament that eu finance ministers plan to discuss what to do about the excessively high bonuses and severance pay earned by some european ceos at a meeting scheduled for october 6-7 . fbi investigates banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi is looking into possible criminal activity by 26 companies meanwhile , the federal bureau of investigation is examining possible criminal activity at 26 companies including recent bailout recipients fannie mae , freddie mac and american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- , according to media reports . major investment bank lehman brothers , which declared bankruptcy last week , is also on the list of firms in the fbi 's probe of accounting and other possible irregularities , the bloomberg financial news agency reported late tuesday , citing a senior law enforcement official . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .
al maliki has warned against the migration of whole layers of the iraqi workforce that would be urgently necessary for the reconstruction of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules .

germany currently has 44 police and civilian experts in afghanistan under the eu mission . the eupol mission will now have 120 german police officers and civil experts , instead of the 60 currently working there .
experts from 21 countries are taking part in the project , which began in 2007 to help the nation create a sustainable police force .
worsening security earlier this year , european union ministers decided to boost the size of the bloc 's police training mission in afghanistan to try to improve security in the face of mounting attacks on international forces by a resurgent taliban .
in a separate bilateral arrangement , the berlin foreign and interior ministries said germany would also boost a direct aid scheme for the afghanistan police . a german training school for police is to open next month in mazar-e-sharif in northern afghanistan .
between 40 and 50 officers will serve at the new facility beginning in october . some 24,000 afghan police have been trained by german police experts since 2002 . germany also has 3,220 soldiers in the 40-nation nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

germany currently has 44 police and civilian experts in afghanistan under the eu mission . the eupol mission will now have 120 german police officers and civil experts , instead of the 60 currently working there .
experts from 21 countries are taking part in the project , which began in 2007 to help the nation create a sustainable police force .
worsening security earlier this year , european union ministers decided to boost the size of the bloc 's police training mission in afghanistan to try to improve security in the face of mounting attacks on international forces by a resurgent taliban .
in a separate bilateral arrangement , the berlin foreign and interior ministries said germany would also boost a direct aid scheme for the afghanistan police . a german training school for police is to open next month in mazar-e-sharif in northern afghanistan .
between 40 and 50 officers will serve at the new facility beginning in october . some 24,000 afghan police have been trained by german police experts since 2002 . germany also has 3,220 soldiers in the 40-nation nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

" iraqi refugees are in urgent need of protection because in contrast to what iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki says , the security situation is alarming , " julia duchrow of amnesty international 's germany chapter told a news conference on tuesday , sept 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unhcr has said europe needs to help jordan and syria in taking iraqi refugees an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled their homes since the us-led invasion in 2003 , with many heading to neighboring countries such as jordan and syria , leading to overcrowding in camps .
another 2.7 million are internally displaced .
william spindler , spokesman for the un refugee agency , unhcr , said the situation in iraq remained too unsafe for iraqis , who have taken refuge in countries such as jordan and syria , to return home .
a unhcr poll in march found that 20 percent of iraqi war refugees live on less than $ 100 a month , a sizeable jump from five months earlier when only 5 percent of iraqi refugees were reflected by this statistic .
groups slam eu procrastination spindler urged the european union to agree to participate in organized attempts to move the refugees to third countries , pointing out that few eu nations had created such repatriation programs .
sweden leads the way in the eu when it comes to accepting iraqi refugees , taking in 18,600 last year alone .
the unhcr says that between april 2007 and september 2008 , it managed to find a new home for 14,600 iraq refugees from syria , jordan and other nations in the mideast .
the us took in more than 60 percent while eu nations accepted less than 10 percent , spindler said .
in july this year , the eu decided to work towards creating better conditions to enable refugees to return back to iraq rather than increasing their numbers in europe .
" periods of reflection , interruptions and playing for time with more research on the ground like the eu plans to do is irresponsible in view of the suffering of refugees , " karl kopp of the rights group pro asyl said at a press conference .
it would be shameful if eu interior ministers postponed a decision to take in more iraqi refugees , as they did in july last year , kopp added .
germany urged to do more in germany , which has granted asylum to just 5,760 iraqis , churches and some politicians have been urging the government to take in more .
in april the eu 's slovenian presidency rejected german proposals to give priority to refugees from iraq 's christian minority , saying that asylum should be provided without consideration of religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maliki is not in favor of iraqis migrating to europe after a meeting with iraqi premier al maliki in july , german chancellor angela merkel expressed support for iraqi government plans to see refugees return home rather than have some of them stay in europe .
al maliki has warned against the migration of whole layers of the iraqi workforce that would be urgently necessary for the reconstruction of the country . dw staff -lrb- sp / dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first of several trials at the munich-based company . wilhelm schelsky , former leader of the conservative aub union , went on trial for fraud and tax evasion on wednesday , sept .
24 . the court was told he filed 44 invoices for 30.3 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- plus tax for work he never carried out . also on trial at the state court in nuremberg was johannes feldmayer , a former member of the main siemens board .
he was accused of misappropriating corporate funds .
he was arrested last year while still a member of the munich-based giant 's executive board and spent nine days in police custody . the double case is the newest of a series in which prosecutors have revealed how bribery was rife at siemens , with executives hiding the expenditure under innocuous descriptions in the corporate accounts . other departments spent large sums paying kickbacks to secure contracts in greece , italy and elsewhere , according to prosecutors . misused millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schelsky is accused of embezzling funds given illegally to him by siemens executive board member feldmayer signed a contract with schelsky in 2001 to pay 2 million euros annually .
on paper , this was mainly for union-operated training courses , but the indictment said feldmayer 's actual purpose was to weaken the ig metall union by promoting aub . ig metall is germany 's principal industrial union and holds seats on the siemens supervisory board .
the tiny aub , which represented non-militant siemens staff , adopted a pro-business stance . " when they signed the contract , the two defendants were of one mind that schelsky did not have to perform what was officially agreed to , but that the fees were to be for the expansion , preservation and cultivation of the aub , " prosecutor antje gabriels-gorsolke told the court . she said that by 2006 , schelsky had begun diverting some of the funds to his own private needs , to his own business interests and to sports sponsorship . juergen lubojanski , representing schelsky , told reporters outside the court that he would show that " much " of the prosecution case was not proven . widespread corruption in a separate investigation , the 161-year-old firm is also engulfed in a slush-fund scandal , in which the company has acknowledged that up to 1.3 billion euros may have been spent on bribes to win foreign contracts . the conglomerate found the practice was widespread across its numerous divisions .
prosecutors are investigating around 300 people in connection with the affair . it led to the resignation of a string of top siemens executives , including chief executive klaus kleinfeld and his long-term predecessor and chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 40-year-old bolton west mp took up her cabinet post last july when gordon brown became prime minister .
but there had been speculation she could leave the government over her objections to the human fertilisation and embryology bill - with her very strong catholic beliefs cited as the reason .
in march of this year , her name was mentioned among catholic ministers and mps who would refuse to back the bill .
the prime minister was forced into a compromise , saying labour mps could have a free vote on three areas .
reports that ms kelly would vote against the bill persisted .
however , claims that this was the reason for her wish to leave the cabinet have been denied .
climbing the ladder ms kelly , who was born in limavady , northern ireland , attended sutton high school and the private westminster school .
she went on to study politics , philosophy and economics at queen 's college , oxford , followed by an msc in economics at the london school of economics .
she married derek gadd , a local government officer , in 1996 .
her first job was as an economics reporter for the guardian , where she is said to have spotted that tory chancellor norman lamont had broken his " golden rule " in the 1992 budget .
she moved on to the bank of england , where she was deputy editor of the quarterly inflation report .
she holds a record by giving birth to four children while being an mp .
her first child was born just 11 days after she took the marginal seat of bolton west from the conservatives in 1997 .
once an mp , she joined the treasury select committee and a year later was made a parliamentary aide to nick brown , the then minister for agriculture , fisheries and food .
she became a minister for the first time after the 2001 election - joining gordon brown 's team as economic secretary to the treasury .
ms kelly was later promoted to financial secretary but took a bigger leap up the government ladder in september 2004 , becoming minister of state for the cabinet office .
she combined that role with being labour 's deputy election and policy co-ordinator , and was involved in drafting up labour 's manifesto for its third term in government .
aged just 36 when appointed as education secretary in december 2004 , ms kelly was the youngest cabinet minister by 10 years .
her appointment was questioned following revelations of links to the catholic conservative movement opus dei , which critics accuse of being secretive and elitist - claims members deny .
ms kelly rejected calls to quit her job or break off links with the group and said : " it is a private spiritual life and i do n't think it is relevant to my job . "
trust schools as education secretary , she rejected government adviser sir mike tomlinson 's proposals to replace gcses and a-levels with a new diploma , to the anger of many educationalists .
ms kelly ran into enormous political flak - not least from labour backbenchers - over proposed changes to schooling in england and the introduction of trust schools .
she moved to the post of communities secretary in may 2006 .
critics said her religious beliefs would guide her judgment in her task of promoting gay rights .
but ms kelly promised to fight discrimination in all forms .
the following year she was heavily criticised after deciding to send her son to a £ 15,000-a-year specialist private school to help with his learning difficulties .
the issue of private education has long been controversial among labour mps .
and in this particular case it gave ammunition to critics who said the government had reduced the number of special needs schools and pursued a policy of including as many children with special needs as possible in mainstream schools .
' right thing ' ms kelly said her decision was a difficult one to take , a decision she knew some would disagree with , but also one that she felt she had to take as she did " the right thing for my son " .
she also stressed that her three other children remained in the state sector - and that she expected her son to go to a state secondary school in due course .
when gordon brown became prime minister in july 2007 , ruth kelly moved from being communities secretary to transport secretary .
it was she who announced that the government had given the go-ahead for the £ 16bn crossrail project across london .
she refused to be drawn on whether a road congestion charge would be introduced in manchester , however - even if residents voted for it in a referendum .
as a conservative mp , boris johnson once said : " i admire the way she has managed to be a real person as well as succeeding in politics .

the 40-year-old bolton west mp took up her cabinet post last july when gordon brown became prime minister .
but there had been speculation she could leave the government over her objections to the human fertilisation and embryology bill - with her very strong catholic beliefs cited as the reason .
in march of this year , her name was mentioned among catholic ministers and mps who would refuse to back the bill .
the prime minister was forced into a compromise , saying labour mps could have a free vote on three areas .
reports that ms kelly would vote against the bill persisted .
however , claims that this was the reason for her wish to leave the cabinet have been denied .
climbing the ladder ms kelly , who was born in limavady , northern ireland , attended sutton high school and the private westminster school .
she went on to study politics , philosophy and economics at queen 's college , oxford , followed by an msc in economics at the london school of economics .
she married derek gadd , a local government officer , in 1996 .
her first job was as an economics reporter for the guardian , where she is said to have spotted that tory chancellor norman lamont had broken his " golden rule " in the 1992 budget .
she moved on to the bank of england , where she was deputy editor of the quarterly inflation report .
she holds a record by giving birth to four children while being an mp .
her first child was born just 11 days after she took the marginal seat of bolton west from the conservatives in 1997 .
once an mp , she joined the treasury select committee and a year later was made a parliamentary aide to nick brown , the then minister for agriculture , fisheries and food .
she became a minister for the first time after the 2001 election - joining gordon brown 's team as economic secretary to the treasury .
ms kelly was later promoted to financial secretary but took a bigger leap up the government ladder in september 2004 , becoming minister of state for the cabinet office .
she combined that role with being labour 's deputy election and policy co-ordinator , and was involved in drafting up labour 's manifesto for its third term in government .
aged just 36 when appointed as education secretary in december 2004 , ms kelly was the youngest cabinet minister by 10 years .
her appointment was questioned following revelations of links to the catholic conservative movement opus dei , which critics accuse of being secretive and elitist - claims members deny .
ms kelly rejected calls to quit her job or break off links with the group and said : " it is a private spiritual life and i do n't think it is relevant to my job . "
trust schools as education secretary , she rejected government adviser sir mike tomlinson 's proposals to replace gcses and a-levels with a new diploma , to the anger of many educationalists .
ms kelly ran into enormous political flak - not least from labour backbenchers - over proposed changes to schooling in england and the introduction of trust schools .
she moved to the post of communities secretary in may 2006 .
critics said her religious beliefs would guide her judgment in her task of promoting gay rights .
but ms kelly promised to fight discrimination in all forms .
the following year she was heavily criticised after deciding to send her son to a £ 15,000-a-year specialist private school to help with his learning difficulties .
the issue of private education has long been controversial among labour mps .
and in this particular case it gave ammunition to critics who said the government had reduced the number of special needs schools and pursued a policy of including as many children with special needs as possible in mainstream schools .
' right thing ' ms kelly said her decision was a difficult one to take , a decision she knew some would disagree with , but also one that she felt she had to take as she did " the right thing for my son " .
she also stressed that her three other children remained in the state sector - and that she expected her son to go to a state secondary school in due course .
when gordon brown became prime minister in july 2007 , ruth kelly moved from being communities secretary to transport secretary .
it was she who announced that the government had given the go-ahead for the £ 16bn crossrail project across london .
she refused to be drawn on whether a road congestion charge would be introduced in manchester , however - even if residents voted for it in a referendum .
as a conservative mp , boris johnson once said : " i admire the way she has managed to be a real person as well as succeeding in politics .
she must be identical twins . "

the 40-year-old bolton west mp took up her cabinet post last july when gordon brown became prime minister .
but there had been speculation she could leave the government over her objections to the human fertilisation and embryology bill - with her very strong catholic beliefs cited as the reason .
in march of this year , her name was mentioned among catholic ministers and mps who would refuse to back the bill .
the prime minister was forced into a compromise , saying labour mps could have a free vote on three areas .
reports that ms kelly would vote against the bill persisted .
however , claims that this was the reason for her wish to leave the cabinet have been denied .
climbing the ladder ms kelly , who was born in limavady , northern ireland , attended sutton high school and the private westminster school .
she went on to study politics , philosophy and economics at queen 's college , oxford , followed by an msc in economics at the london school of economics .
she married derek gadd , a local government officer , in 1996 .
her first job was as an economics reporter for the guardian , where she is said to have spotted that tory chancellor norman lamont had broken his " golden rule " in the 1992 budget .
she moved on to the bank of england , where she was deputy editor of the quarterly inflation report .
she holds a record by giving birth to four children while being an mp .
her first child was born just 11 days after she took the marginal seat of bolton west from the conservatives in 1997 .
once an mp , she joined the treasury select committee and a year later was made a parliamentary aide to nick brown , the then minister for agriculture , fisheries and food .
she became a minister for the first time after the 2001 election - joining gordon brown 's team as economic secretary to the treasury .
ms kelly was later promoted to financial secretary but took a bigger leap up the government ladder in september 2004 , becoming minister of state for the cabinet office .
she combined that role with being labour 's deputy election and policy co-ordinator , and was involved in drafting up labour 's manifesto for its third term in government .
aged just 36 when appointed as education secretary in december 2004 , ms kelly was the youngest cabinet minister by 10 years .
her appointment was questioned following revelations of links to the catholic conservative movement opus dei , which critics accuse of being secretive and elitist - claims members deny .
ms kelly rejected calls to quit her job or break off links with the group and said : " it is a private spiritual life and i do n't think it is relevant to my job . "
trust schools as education secretary , she rejected government adviser sir mike tomlinson 's proposals to replace gcses and a-levels with a new diploma , to the anger of many educationalists .
ms kelly ran into enormous political flak - not least from labour backbenchers - over proposed changes to schooling in england and the introduction of trust schools .
she moved to the post of communities secretary in may 2006 .
critics said her religious beliefs would guide her judgment in her task of promoting gay rights .
but ms kelly promised to fight discrimination in all forms .
the following year she was heavily criticised after deciding to send her son to a £ 15,000-a-year specialist private school to help with his learning difficulties .
the issue of private education has long been controversial among labour mps .
and in this particular case it gave ammunition to critics who said the government had reduced the number of special needs schools and pursued a policy of including as many children with special needs as possible in mainstream schools .
' right thing ' ms kelly said her decision was a difficult one to take , a decision she knew some would disagree with , but also one that she felt she had to take as she did " the right thing for my son " .
she also stressed that her three other children remained in the state sector - and that she expected her son to go to a state secondary school in due course .
when gordon brown became prime minister in july 2007 , ruth kelly moved from being communities secretary to transport secretary .
it was she who announced that the government had given the go-ahead for the £ 16bn crossrail project across london .
she refused to be drawn on whether a road congestion charge would be introduced in manchester , however - even if residents voted for it in a referendum .
as a conservative mp , boris johnson once said : " i admire the way she has managed to be a real person as well as succeeding in politics .
she must be identical twins . "

indian officials say it is an important development for the agreement , which must now be passed by the full senate and the house of representatives .
the deal will then have to be signed by the us president before it becomes law .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh is in the us to attend the un general assembly .
he is due to meet president george bush on thursday .
officials hope the us congress will approve the deal before the meeting .
earlier this month , the nuclear suppliers group lifted a ban that had stopped india from getting access to the global nuclear market .
' significant ' the senate foreign relations committee voted 19-2 to approve the deal on tuesday .
" enactment of this bill will help the us-india relationship grow , " news agency associated press quoted senator joseph biden as saying .
pm manmohan singh has described the nuclear deal as " momentous " the chairman of the foreign relations committee - and democratic candidate for vice-president - added : " today 's committee passage is significant , but several steps remain before this bill becomes law .
" i hope the congress can complete the job in the few days remaining before adjournment , and i 'll continue fighting as hard as i can to achieve this important victory . "
meanwhile , mr singh , who arrived in new york on tuesday , said he was hopeful that the deal would be approved quickly .
india says the deal with the us is vital for it to meet its civil energy demands .
but critics say it creates a dangerous precedent - effectively allowing india to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- as other nations must .
centrepiece they say the deal would undermine the arguments for isolating iran over its nuclear programme and be a disaster for international non-proliferation efforts .
the agreement is the centrepiece of us efforts to bolster ties with india .
earlier in september , the deal crossed a crucial hurdle when the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group approved it .
mr singh said the decision marked " the end of india 's decades-long isolation from the nuclear mainstream and of the technology denial regime " .

his illness was so severe that he was told he had only months to live .
andy crabb was not given the drugs he needs by his local pct andy 's consultant suggested that he started an experimental drug trial , but the side effects were so severe that andy had to stop it .
by now he was bedridden and extremely ill .
andy 's oncologist then applied for a new and expensive drug called sutent .
it would not cure him , but it was hoped that it would stop his tumours growing and improve and extend his life .
however , andy 's local health authority - oxfordshire primary care trust - said it only provides sutent for exceptional cases , and they ruled that andy 's case was not exceptional .
fundraising though planning to appeal against this decision , andy and his wife diane felt that since his condition was deteriorating rapidly , their only choice was to pay for the drug privately .
andy 's wife diane said : " i think it 's disgraceful , absolutely disgraceful .
why do we have to pay for it when it should be available on the nhs ? "
using money gained by fundraising from friends and family , andy was able to start paying for the treatment in may 2008 .
kate spall , a health campaigner who has helped andy and diane , says the couple are not alone in having to fundraise to pay for a life-extending treatment .
" i think it 's disgusting they are having to fundraise for this treatment , " she said .
" i ca n't imagine how andy must feel - -lrb- it -rrb- must put so much pressure on them . "
the drug costs andy , a former bricklayer , around £ 3,400 every six weeks , but he only has enough money to last until the new year .
after that , unless he has persuaded his pct to give him the drug on the nhs , he may have to sell his house in order to keep paying for the drug .
postcode lottery andy is determined that he will live life to the full , despite his cancer if andy lived in the neighbouring county of buckinghamshire , however , things might have been different .
although his own pct only provided sutent to one person out of the 13 who applied for it last year , buckinghamshire pct provided it to 13 of the 15 people who applied .
living in a different area could have meant andy got the life-extending drug his oncologist recommended without having to worry about raising nearly £ 30,000 a year .
despite the pressure andy is under to find the money to pay for his drugs , he remains optimistic .
he said : " some people just get told that they 've got cancer , and give up , i think .
" you either go one way or the other and i 've definitely gone the other thinking , ' well , i 've got to go and live life to the full ' . "
dom 's on the case , a five-part investigation into the nhs continues on wednesday , 24th september , 2008 at 9:15am on bbc one .

the report , published in the british medical journal the lancet , says 3m self-injecting drug users worldwide could now be hiv-positive .
in nine countries , more than 40 % of drug users were infected .
the authors are concerned about the lack of data from africa and say the risk factors that have helped spread hiv in this way exist on the continent .
drug user hiv blackspots countries where over 40 % of injecting drug users are thought to be hiv positive : estonia : 72.1 % argentina : 49.7 % brazil : 48.0 % kenya : 42.9 % burma : 42.6 % indonesia : 42.5 % thailand : 42.5 % ukraine : 41.8 % nepal : 41.4 % they said there was a " pressing need " to address the problem .
the scientists behind this study , frmo the university of new south wales in australia , carried out a wide-ranging review of published data .
they concluded that both the numbers of injecting drug users and the prevalence of hiv infection among them are on the increase .
the virus is spread mainly by the use of shared needles .
in some countries in south east asia , latin america and eastern europe the rates of infection among injecting users are above 40 % .
in estonia it is more than 72 % .
but some countries have maintained very low rates of infection , such as the uk - where the rate is 2.3 % - new zealand and australia where only 1.5 % of injecting drug users are hiv-positive .
needle exchange researchers say that this was due to the swift introduction of needle exchange programmes in the 1980s .
the report says that there is a clear mandate to invest in hiv prevention programmes such as needle exchanges and drug substitution treatments .
there is also a clear need for education to help prevent the spread of infection in countries where injecting drug use is common but where the virus has not yet become widespread among users .
" the high prevalence of hiv among many populations of injecting drug users represents a substantial global health challenge , " the authors say .
michael carter , of the hiv information service nam , said the report provided " striking evidence " to support the provision of needle exchange programmes .
he said : " the uk has historically low rates of hiv amongst injecting drug users because we put health promotion first .
" compare this to the hiv prevalence in countries which have resisted the provision of needle exchanges in the misguided belief that they ' encourage ' drug use . "
mr carter added there was good evidence that idus can do very well on anti-hiv treatment - but often stigma and discrimination meant that they were denied potentially life-saving drugs .
ailsa spindler , of the charity terrence higgins trust scotland , said : " there is a long way to go globally in tackling idu , its causes and its effects on health , including hiv transmission . "
she said health among idus was " relatively good " in the uk , but the number of new hiv diagnoses among the group had increased gradually over the past five years .

the report , published in the british medical journal the lancet , says 3m self-injecting drug users worldwide could now be hiv-positive .
in nine countries , more than 40 % of drug users were infected .
the authors are concerned about the lack of data from africa and say the risk factors that have helped spread hiv in this way exist on the continent .
drug user hiv blackspots countries where over 40 % of injecting drug users are thought to be hiv positive : estonia : 72.1 % argentina : 49.7 % brazil : 48.0 % kenya : 42.9 % burma : 42.6 % indonesia : 42.5 % thailand : 42.5 % ukraine : 41.8 % nepal : 41.4 % they said there was a " pressing need " to address the problem .
the scientists behind this study , frmo the university of new south wales in australia , carried out a wide-ranging review of published data .
they concluded that both the numbers of injecting drug users and the prevalence of hiv infection among them are on the increase .
the virus is spread mainly by the use of shared needles .
in some countries in south east asia , latin america and eastern europe the rates of infection among injecting users are above 40 % .
in estonia it is more than 72 % .
but some countries have maintained very low rates of infection , such as the uk - where the rate is 2.3 % - new zealand and australia where only 1.5 % of injecting drug users are hiv-positive .
needle exchange researchers say that this was due to the swift introduction of needle exchange programmes in the 1980s .
the report says that there is a clear mandate to invest in hiv prevention programmes such as needle exchanges and drug substitution treatments .
there is also a clear need for education to help prevent the spread of infection in countries where injecting drug use is common but where the virus has not yet become widespread among users .
" the high prevalence of hiv among many populations of injecting drug users represents a substantial global health challenge , " the authors say .
michael carter , of the hiv information service nam , said the report provided " striking evidence " to support the provision of needle exchange programmes .
he said : " the uk has historically low rates of hiv amongst injecting drug users because we put health promotion first .
" compare this to the hiv prevalence in countries which have resisted the provision of needle exchanges in the misguided belief that they ' encourage ' drug use . "
mr carter added there was good evidence that idus can do very well on anti-hiv treatment - but often stigma and discrimination meant that they were denied potentially life-saving drugs .
ailsa spindler , of the charity terrence higgins trust scotland , said : " there is a long way to go globally in tackling idu , its causes and its effects on health , including hiv transmission . "
she said health among idus was " relatively good " in the uk , but the number of new hiv diagnoses among the group had increased gradually over the past five years .

a study of breast cancer patients in england and wales diagnosed between 1986 and 1999 found overall long-term survival rates are improving .
however , survival rates one year after diagnosis were worse among poor women than those who were more affluent .
and the british journal of cancer study found this " deprivation gap " doubled five years after diagnosis .
the inequalities in breast cancer survival between richer and poorer women that have been identified are of great concern dr sarah cant breakthrough breast cancer the study , which looked at more than 380,000 women , found that even after adjustijng for other causes of death , the five-year survival rate was about 6 % higher for affluent women .
the figures are part of a detailed analysis of survival rates for the 20 most common forms of cancer .
the researchers found that one-year survival rates tended to be higher among affluent women across a range of cancers .
however , breast cancer was the only form of the disease for which this deprivation gap continued to widen years after diagnosis .
lead researcher professor michel coleman , an epidemiologist for cancer research uk , said women from poor backgrounds might be less likely to access radiotherapy or drug treatment .
others said the key could be that patients living in deprived areas were more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage , or to have other life-threatening diseases .
improvements dr sarah cant , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said there had been significant improvements in access to services and treatments since the 2000 cancer plan which would not be be reflected in the study .
however , she said : " the inequalities in breast cancer survival between richer and poorer women that have been identified are of great concern .
" it is vital to continue to investigate the exact causes of any inequalities so appropriate measures to tackle them can be taken . "
professor mike richards , national cancer director for england , said there tended to be a difference of opinion between clinicians and epidemiologists about the reasons for a deprivation gap .
he said : " in general clinicians were likely to attribute the deprivation gap in survival mainly to the fact that people from poorer backgrounds had other diseases as well as cancer .
" by contrast statisticians put more emphasis on late diagnosis in deprived groups as a cause for poorer survival .
" these differences of opinion highlight the need for high quality information on the details of cancer staging and additional diseases to be collected by clinical teams and made available to the cancer registries . "
for most cancers survival up to 10 years has improved significantly between those diagnosed in the mid 1980s and the late 1990s .
but there was almost no change in survival for lung , pancreatic , cervical and bladder cancer .

britain 's nuclear future is expected to be dominated by french firms selling british energy to edf is about more than just a handover of physical assets .
the deal also completes the line-up of participants in a nuclear race that will lead to the creation of two essentially new branches of britain 's nuclear industry .
one is needed to clean up the mess left behind after half a century of nuclear weapons and energy production .
the other is getting ready to build an entirely new generation of at least eight nuclear reactors , after the government gave the go-ahead for the rebirth of the nuclear industry early this year .
" the role for nuclear new-build as an integral part of uk energy policy is now firmly established , " according to british energy 's chief executive , bill coley .
national asset ?
both clean-up and new-build will create thousands of jobs in the uk , paid for by a mixture of government cash , income from existing and new operators , and investment by the financial sector .
the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build bill coley , chief executive , british energy edf agrees to buy british energy and if british energy is eventually sold to edf , both clean-up and new-build will be dominated by large french companies , which are themselves controlled by the french state .
such a prospect has alarmed critics who question whether it makes sense to transfer this much control from the british to the french government , though there are also many who insist it is not only eminently acceptable but also hugely desirable .
french ambitions edf 's acquisition of british energy is at the heart of french commercial nuclear ambitions in the uk .
contamination from the tricastin plants has given opponents ammunition british energy is the main player in the uk 's nuclear industry .
its eight existing nuclear reactors , which currently generate some 14 % of the domestic electricity supply , will provide edf with an income as it sells the electricity generated by the plants to its existing retail customers .
and as can be seen from recent hikes in electricity prices , this is a valuable commodity in its own right , and an asset that will benefit edf 's uk partner centrica , which is set to acquire a 25 % stake in british energy .
but far more important are the strategic benefits of the takeover .
the next generation of nuclear generators will most likely be built on existing sites owned by british energy .
dungeness in kent , sizewell in suffolk , bradwell in essex and hinkley point in somerset are among the most likely sites for new-build , according to industry insiders .
" the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new-build , " according to an earlier statement by mr coley .
hence , ownership of british energy would give edf considerable market power , which in turn would make it a natural front-runner when the uk government decides who should build the new reactors .
clean-up contract the other side of the equation is made up by edf 's commercial partner , areva of france , which has already entered the uk nuclear industry through the clean-up operations .
have your say nuclear was always the future - as long as edf does indeed spend the money needed it should be welcomed .
philip charles le roux , aldershot send us your comments areva , which is expected to construct the reactors that edf wants to build in the uk , is also the lead member of nuclear management partners , a consortium that also includes amec of the uk , and urs washington division of the us .
in july , areva and its partners were named preferred bidders to decommission the sprawling medley of waste stores and old reactors at sellafield , a contract worth some £ 6.5bn over a five-year period .
nuclear management partners won the contract ahead of rivals such as fluor , babcock & wilcox , bechtel , serco and toshiba .
a possible extension of the contract until 2025 would make the deal worth more than £ 22bn .
when measured by volume , some 65 % of britain 's nuclear waste is stored at sellafield in cumbria , but when measured by its radioactivity some 95 % of the uk 's nuclear waste is stored here .
hence , this is where most of the vast and growing clean-up budget will be spent over the next decades .
enormous investment dungeness is among the nuclear reactors destined for closure given the sums that are being piled into both clean-up and new-build , it might make more sense to talk about two separate nuclear industries in the uk .
the clean-up industry alone is set to attract at least £ 100bn over a 75-year period , including the cost of treating the waste from the nuclear weapons industry .
the cost of decommissioning , reprocessing and storing the waste accumulated by the uk 's civilian power generation industry over the years accounts for more than three-quarters of the total clean-up costs - or £ 83bn , less an expected income from reactors that are still operational of some £ 10bn .
the work includes the gradual closure of existing reactors over the next 15 years , and their subsequent decommissioning , as well as the reprocessing of 470,000 cubic metres of existing nuclear waste , which is currently stored above ground at 37 sites across the uk .
the size of the new-build industry is trickier to quantify .
prime minister gordon brown has said at least eight new reactors must be built over the next couple of decades soon after the first of the new reactors becomes operational , in 2017 at the earliest , the new-build industry will begin to add to the size of the clean-up industry .
however , since the uk will most likely adopt a single reactor system for all its new nuclear power plants , there will only be one type of waste stream .
that will help curb reprocessing costs when compared with the cost of dealing with waste from a string of different reactors - as has been the case hitherto in the uk .
complex situation given their extensive experience at home , edf and areva , both controlled by the french government , may well be well placed to take lead roles as the uk sets out to revive its nuclear industry .
after all , some 80 % of france 's electricity is generated by its 59 nuclear power generators , compared with less than 20 % in the uk , so the two companies ' proven ability as technical and commercial operators is not being questioned .
yet a complex situation could arise from the way the nuclear industry is being funded .
when it comes to the building and running of reactors , it is straightforward ; put simply , the return on upfront investment will come from the sale of power in the future - though expect government guarantees of demand to be embedded in contracts here .
but the clean-up costs , which are covered by taxes , are supplemented by income from ongoing operations at the plants .
cleaning up sellafield is a large and lucrative task at sellafield , much of that income was supposed to come from the waste reprocessing plant thorp 's ability to extract reusable uranium from spent fuel rods .
but in april 2005 , a pipe burst , causing a leak of 83 cubic metres of contaminated liquids into a concrete cell lined with stainless steel .
nobody was harmed by the leak , but thorp faced a lengthy closure that reduced the budget of sellafield 's owner , the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- .
the nda was forced to go cap in hand to the uk government and ask for a fresh cash injection .
it is easy to imagine the political storm it would create if a consortium led by france 's areva were to do the same .
trust and safety beyond the concerns about mounting costs lie the thorny issues of safety and trust .
a couple of recent incidents in france have made such concerns pertinent .
in july , 100 workers at edf 's tricastin power plant in bollene , southern france , were contaminated as waste particles escaped from a pipe during maintenance work .
medical checks found the workers were all fine as the contamination was mild , but it nevertheless pointed to a lack of control .
and only a few weeks earlier , an adjacent areva subsidiary failed to notify the locals until late in the afternoon the day after some 75kg of liquid containing unenriched uranium leaked into the ground water .
the leak was taken seriously .
locals were told to stop drinking tap water ; swimming pools were covered up ; farmers and gardeners stopped watering their crops .
for the companies in france , the challenge has been to rebuild confidence in the nuclear industry .
in the uk , the incidents have given opponents of the government 's power plans ample ammunition as they are trying to shoot down its nuclear ambitions .

philip charles le roux , aldershot send us your comments areva , which is expected to construct the reactors that edf wants to build in the uk , is also the lead member of nuclear management partners , a consortium that also includes amec of the uk , and urs washington division of the us .
in july , areva and its partners were named preferred bidders to decommission the sprawling medley of waste stores and old reactors at sellafield , a contract worth some £ 6.5bn over a five-year period .
nuclear management partners won the contract ahead of rivals such as fluor , babcock & wilcox , bechtel , serco and toshiba .
a possible extension of the contract until 2025 would make the deal worth more than £ 22bn .
when measured by volume , some 65 % of britain 's nuclear waste is stored at sellafield in cumbria , but when measured by its radioactivity some 95 % of the uk 's nuclear waste is stored here .
hence , this is where most of the vast and growing clean-up budget will be spent over the next decades .
enormous investment dungeness is among the nuclear reactors destined for closure given the sums that are being piled into both clean-up and new-build , it might make more sense to talk about two separate nuclear industries in the uk .
the clean-up industry alone is set to attract at least £ 100bn over a 75-year period , including the cost of treating the waste from the nuclear weapons industry .
the cost of decommissioning , reprocessing and storing the waste accumulated by the uk 's civilian power generation industry over the years accounts for more than three-quarters of the total clean-up costs - or £ 83bn , less an expected income from reactors that are still operational of some £ 10bn .
the work includes the gradual closure of existing reactors over the next 15 years , and their subsequent decommissioning , as well as the reprocessing of 470,000 cubic metres of existing nuclear waste , which is currently stored above ground at 37 sites across the uk .
the size of the new-build industry is trickier to quantify .
prime minister gordon brown has said at least eight new reactors must be built over the next couple of decades soon after the first of the new reactors becomes operational , in 2017 at the earliest , the new-build industry will begin to add to the size of the clean-up industry .
however , since the uk will most likely adopt a single reactor system for all its new nuclear power plants , there will only be one type of waste stream .
that will help curb reprocessing costs when compared with the cost of dealing with waste from a string of different reactors - as has been the case hitherto in the uk .
complex situation given their extensive experience at home , edf and areva , both controlled by the french government , may well be well placed to take lead roles as the uk sets out to revive its nuclear industry .
after all , some 80 % of france 's electricity is generated by its 59 nuclear power generators , compared with less than 20 % in the uk , so the two companies ' proven ability as technical and commercial operators is not being questioned .
yet a complex situation could arise from the way the nuclear industry is being funded .
when it comes to the building and running of reactors , it is straightforward ; put simply , the return on upfront investment will come from the sale of power in the future - though expect government guarantees of demand to be embedded in contracts here .
but the clean-up costs , which are covered by taxes , are supplemented by income from ongoing operations at the plants .
cleaning up sellafield is a large and lucrative task at sellafield , much of that income was supposed to come from the waste reprocessing plant thorp 's ability to extract reusable uranium from spent fuel rods .
but in april 2005 , a pipe burst , causing a leak of 83 cubic metres of contaminated liquids into a concrete cell lined with stainless steel .
nobody was harmed by the leak , but thorp faced a lengthy closure that reduced the budget of sellafield 's owner , the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- .
the nda was forced to go cap in hand to the uk government and ask for a fresh cash injection .
it is easy to imagine the political storm it would create if a consortium led by france 's areva were to do the same .
trust and safety beyond the concerns about mounting costs lie the thorny issues of safety and trust .
a couple of recent incidents in france have made such concerns pertinent .
in july , 100 workers at edf 's tricastin power plant in bollene , southern france , were contaminated as waste particles escaped from a pipe during maintenance work .
medical checks found the workers were all fine as the contamination was mild , but it nevertheless pointed to a lack of control .
and only a few weeks earlier , an adjacent areva subsidiary failed to notify the locals until late in the afternoon the day after some 75kg of liquid containing unenriched uranium leaked into the ground water .
the leak was taken seriously .
locals were told to stop drinking tap water ; swimming pools were covered up ; farmers and gardeners stopped watering their crops .
for the companies in france , the challenge has been to rebuild confidence in the nuclear industry .
in the uk , the incidents have given opponents of the government 's power plans ample ammunition as they are trying to shoot down its nuclear ambitions .

britain 's nuclear future is expected to be dominated by french firms selling british energy to edf is about more than just a handover of physical assets .
the deal also completes the line-up of participants in a nuclear race that will lead to the creation of two essentially new branches of britain 's nuclear industry .
one is needed to clean up the mess left behind after half a century of nuclear weapons and energy production .
the other is getting ready to build an entirely new generation of at least eight nuclear reactors , after the government gave the go-ahead for the rebirth of the nuclear industry early this year .
" the role for nuclear new-build as an integral part of uk energy policy is now firmly established , " according to british energy 's chief executive , bill coley .
national asset ?
both clean-up and new-build will create thousands of jobs in the uk , paid for by a mixture of government cash , income from existing and new operators , and investment by the financial sector .
the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build bill coley , chief executive , british energy edf agrees to buy british energy and if british energy is eventually sold to edf , both clean-up and new-build will be dominated by large french companies , which are themselves controlled by the french state .
such a prospect has alarmed critics who question whether it makes sense to transfer this much control from the british to the french government , though there are also many who insist it is not only eminently acceptable but also hugely desirable .
french ambitions edf 's acquisition of british energy is at the heart of french commercial nuclear ambitions in the uk .
contamination from the tricastin plants has given opponents ammunition british energy is the main player in the uk 's nuclear industry .
its eight existing nuclear reactors , which currently generate some 14 % of the domestic electricity supply , will provide edf with an income as it sells the electricity generated by the plants to its existing retail customers .
and as can be seen from recent hikes in electricity prices , this is a valuable commodity in its own right , and an asset that will benefit edf 's uk partner centrica , which is set to acquire a 25 % stake in british energy .
but far more important are the strategic benefits of the takeover .
the next generation of nuclear generators will most likely be built on existing sites owned by british energy .
dungeness in kent , sizewell in suffolk , bradwell in essex and hinkley point in somerset are among the most likely sites for new-build , according to industry insiders .
" the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new-build , " according to an earlier statement by mr coley .
hence , ownership of british energy would give edf considerable market power , which in turn would make it a natural front-runner when the uk government decides who should build the new reactors .

its eight existing nuclear reactors , which currently generate some 14 % of the domestic electricity supply , will provide edf with an income as it sells the electricity generated by the plants to its existing retail customers .
and as can be seen from recent hikes in electricity prices , this is a valuable commodity in its own right , and an asset that will benefit edf 's uk partner centrica , which is set to acquire a 25 % stake in british energy .
but far more important are the strategic benefits of the takeover .
the next generation of nuclear generators will most likely be built on existing sites owned by british energy .
dungeness in kent , sizewell in suffolk , bradwell in essex and hinkley point in somerset are among the most likely sites for new-build , according to industry insiders .
" the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new-build , " according to an earlier statement by mr coley .
hence , ownership of british energy would give edf considerable market power , which in turn would make it a natural front-runner when the uk government decides who should build the new reactors .
clean-up contract the other side of the equation is made up by edf 's commercial partner , areva of france , which has already entered the uk nuclear industry through the clean-up operations .
have your say nuclear was always the future - as long as edf does indeed spend the money needed it should be welcomed .
philip charles le roux , aldershot send us your comments areva , which is expected to construct the reactors that edf wants to build in the uk , is also the lead member of nuclear management partners , a consortium that also includes amec of the uk , and urs washington division of the us .
in july , areva and its partners were named preferred bidders to decommission the sprawling medley of waste stores and old reactors at sellafield , a contract worth some £ 6.5bn over a five-year period .
nuclear management partners won the contract ahead of rivals such as fluor , babcock & wilcox , bechtel , serco and toshiba .
a possible extension of the contract until 2025 would make the deal worth more than £ 22bn .
when measured by volume , some 65 % of britain 's nuclear waste is stored at sellafield in cumbria , but when measured by its radioactivity some 95 % of the uk 's nuclear waste is stored here .
hence , this is where most of the vast and growing clean-up budget will be spent over the next decades .
enormous investment dungeness is among the nuclear reactors destined for closure given the sums that are being piled into both clean-up and new-build , it might make more sense to talk about two separate nuclear industries in the uk .
the clean-up industry alone is set to attract at least £ 100bn over a 75-year period , including the cost of treating the waste from the nuclear weapons industry .
the cost of decommissioning , reprocessing and storing the waste accumulated by the uk 's civilian power generation industry over the years accounts for more than three-quarters of the total clean-up costs - or £ 83bn , less an expected income from reactors that are still operational of some £ 10bn .
the work includes the gradual closure of existing reactors over the next 15 years , and their subsequent decommissioning , as well as the reprocessing of 470,000 cubic metres of existing nuclear waste , which is currently stored above ground at 37 sites across the uk .
the size of the new-build industry is trickier to quantify .
prime minister gordon brown has said at least eight new reactors must be built over the next couple of decades soon after the first of the new reactors becomes operational , in 2017 at the earliest , the new-build industry will begin to add to the size of the clean-up industry .
however , since the uk will most likely adopt a single reactor system for all its new nuclear power plants , there will only be one type of waste stream .
that will help curb reprocessing costs when compared with the cost of dealing with waste from a string of different reactors - as has been the case hitherto in the uk .
complex situation given their extensive experience at home , edf and areva , both controlled by the french government , may well be well placed to take lead roles as the uk sets out to revive its nuclear industry .
after all , some 80 % of france 's electricity is generated by its 59 nuclear power generators , compared with less than 20 % in the uk , so the two companies ' proven ability as technical and commercial operators is not being questioned .
yet a complex situation could arise from the way the nuclear industry is being funded .
when it comes to the building and running of reactors , it is straightforward ; put simply , the return on upfront investment will come from the sale of power in the future - though expect government guarantees of demand to be embedded in contracts here .
but the clean-up costs , which are covered by taxes , are supplemented by income from ongoing operations at the plants .
cleaning up sellafield is a large and lucrative task at sellafield , much of that income was supposed to come from the waste reprocessing plant thorp 's ability to extract reusable uranium from spent fuel rods .
but in april 2005 , a pipe burst , causing a leak of 83 cubic metres of contaminated liquids into a concrete cell lined with stainless steel .
nobody was harmed by the leak , but thorp faced a lengthy closure that reduced the budget of sellafield 's owner , the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- .
the nda was forced to go cap in hand to the uk government and ask for a fresh cash injection .
it is easy to imagine the political storm it would create if a consortium led by france 's areva were to do the same .
trust and safety beyond the concerns about mounting costs lie the thorny issues of safety and trust .
a couple of recent incidents in france have made such concerns pertinent .
in july , 100 workers at edf 's tricastin power plant in bollene , southern france , were contaminated as waste particles escaped from a pipe during maintenance work .
medical checks found the workers were all fine as the contamination was mild , but it nevertheless pointed to a lack of control .
and only a few weeks earlier , an adjacent areva subsidiary failed to notify the locals until late in the afternoon the day after some 75kg of liquid containing unenriched uranium leaked into the ground water .
the leak was taken seriously .
locals were told to stop drinking tap water ; swimming pools were covered up ; farmers and gardeners stopped watering their crops .
for the companies in france , the challenge has been to rebuild confidence in the nuclear industry .
in the uk , the incidents have given opponents of the government 's power plans ample ammunition as they are trying to shoot down its nuclear ambitions .

selling british energy to edf is about more than just a handover of physical assets .
the deal also completes the line-up of participants in a nuclear race that will lead to the creation of two essentially new branches of britain 's nuclear industry .
one is needed to clean up the mess left behind after half a century of nuclear weapons and energy production .
the other is getting ready to build an entirely new generation of at least eight nuclear reactors , after the government gave the go-ahead for the rebirth of the nuclear industry early this year .
" the role for nuclear new-build as an integral part of uk energy policy is now firmly established , " according to british energy 's chief executive , bill coley .
national asset ?
both clean-up and new-build will create thousands of jobs in the uk , paid for by a mixture of government cash , income from existing and new operators , and investment by the financial sector . "
the expertise of our people , together with our sites , makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build " bill coley , chief executive , british energy edf agrees to buy british energy and if british energy is eventually sold to edf , both clean-up and new-build will be dominated by large french companies , which are themselves controlled by the french state .
such a prospect has alarmed critics who question whether it makes sense to transfer this much control from the british to the french government , though there are also many who insist it is not only eminently acceptable but also hugely desirable .

it ruled that the editor , hugo restall , also defamed singapore 's founding father lee kuan yew and his son , current prime minister lee hsein loong .
the case was about an article in feer in 2006 , based on an interview with singapore politician chee soon juan .
the singapore government has frequently resorted to its own courts to protect its reputation .
singapore state media reported that justice woo bih li had reached his conclusion of defamation by summary judgement , as requested by the lees .
in such a judgement , the court makes a ruling without the case going to trial , as it agrees with the applicant that the defence arguments are baseless , the straits times newspaper added .
damages are to be assessed later .
feer has a month in which to lodge an appeal .
the straits times reported that lawyers for the lees had said the article at the centre of the case was " calculated to disparage both leaders by suggesting they were corrupt and unfit for office , and would sue and suppress those who questioned them as the questions would expose their corruption " .
the article which had aroused the lees ' anger was entitled singapore 's ' martyr , ' chee soon juan .
it described the singapore democratic party secretary general 's battle against the ruling people 's action party and its leaders .
feer had argued that the article was based on facts and fair comment , concerned matters of public interest and was a neutral report .
but justice woo said feer 's defences failed or did not apply in singapore , the straits times said .
he said there was no doubt the defamatory words in the article referred to the two singapore leaders , and that other references that linked the government to singapore 's national kidney foundation -lrb- nkf -rrb- and its disgraced director tt durai amounted to " defamation by implication " .
justice woo found the article to mean that lee kuan yew " has been running and continues to run singapore in the same corrupt manner as durai operated nkf and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption " , the newspaper reported .
he also found the article to mean that prime minister lee " is unfit for office because he is corrupt and he too has set out to sue and suppress those who question him to cover up his corruption " .
not ' neutral ' justice woo rejected feer 's argument that the article constituted fair comment , saying the words in question were allegations of facts and not comments .
feer 's argument that dr chee was entitled to respond to allegations made against him by the lees , was also rejected , as justice woo found the defamatory words went beyond such a response .
the allegation of corruption against the lees was " plainly an example of someone going beyond defence and proceeding to offence " , he was reported to have said by the straits times .
singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in defamation cases against critics and foreign publications , which they have said are necessary to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks .
singapore has also banned several foreign publications from distributing their products in singapore , and has required those that do distribute there to promise to abide by stringent media rules .

it ruled that the editor , hugo restall , also defamed singapore 's founding father lee kuan yew and his son , current prime minister lee hsein loong .
the case was about an article in feer in 2006 , based on an interview with singapore politician chee soon juan .
the singapore government has frequently resorted to its own courts to protect its reputation .
singapore state media reported that justice woo bih li had reached his conclusion of defamation by summary judgement , as requested by the lees .
in such a judgement , the court makes a ruling without the case going to trial , as it agrees with the applicant that the defence arguments are baseless , the straits times newspaper added .
damages are to be assessed later .
feer has a month in which to lodge an appeal .
the straits times reported that lawyers for the lees had said the article at the centre of the case was " calculated to disparage both leaders by suggesting they were corrupt and unfit for office , and would sue and suppress those who questioned them as the questions would expose their corruption " .
the article which had aroused the lees ' anger was entitled singapore 's ' martyr , ' chee soon juan .
it described the singapore democratic party secretary general 's battle against the ruling people 's action party and its leaders .
feer had argued that the article was based on facts and fair comment , concerned matters of public interest and was a neutral report .
but justice woo said feer 's defences failed or did not apply in singapore , the straits times said .
he said there was no doubt the defamatory words in the article referred to the two singapore leaders , and that other references that linked the government to singapore 's national kidney foundation -lrb- nkf -rrb- and its disgraced director tt durai amounted to " defamation by implication " .
justice woo found the article to mean that lee kuan yew " has been running and continues to run singapore in the same corrupt manner as durai operated nkf and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption " , the newspaper reported .
he also found the article to mean that prime minister lee " is unfit for office because he is corrupt and he too has set out to sue and suppress those who question him to cover up his corruption " .
not ' neutral ' justice woo rejected feer 's argument that the article constituted fair comment , saying the words in question were allegations of facts and not comments .
feer 's argument that dr chee was entitled to respond to allegations made against him by the lees , was also rejected , as justice woo found the defamatory words went beyond such a response .
the allegation of corruption against the lees was " plainly an example of someone going beyond defence and proceeding to offence " , he was reported to have said by the straits times .
singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in defamation cases against critics and foreign publications , which they have said are necessary to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks .
singapore has also banned several foreign publications from distributing their products in singapore , and has required those that do distribute there to promise to abide by stringent media rules .
