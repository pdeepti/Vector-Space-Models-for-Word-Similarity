would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .

5 , quoting from a letter written by joseph luns , the foreign minister at the time .
luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .
the letter was sent to the dutch ambassador to the united states , informing him of the official position of the ministry of education , art and science towards the anne frank house .
the newspaper said the letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's archives was being moved to a new home .
house narrowly escaped demolition according to the anne frank foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anne frank house is now a museum located on amsterdam 's prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book anne frank - " the dairy of a young girl " was published in 1947 .
in the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
since then it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every year .
anne frank was deported to the german concentration camp at belsen where she died in march 1945 at the age of 16 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

5 , quoting from a letter written by joseph luns , the foreign minister at the time .
luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .
the letter was sent to the dutch ambassador to the united states , informing him of the official position of the ministry of education , art and science towards the anne frank house .
the newspaper said the letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's archives was being moved to a new home .
house narrowly escaped demolition according to the anne frank foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anne frank house is now a museum located on amsterdam 's prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book anne frank - " the dairy of a young girl " was published in 1947 .
in the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
since then it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every year .
anne frank was deported to the german concentration camp at belsen where she died in march 1945 at the age of 16 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .
france currently holds the 27-member bloc 's rotating presidency . a statement released after the talks said , " the application of the stability and growth pact should also reflect the current exceptional circumstances . "
the pact imposes rules public spending rules on eu member states , but includes a clause that allows countries flexibility in difficult situations . relaxing national budget regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel stood out in the crowd of political leaders this was a victory for sarkozy , whose closest advisor henry guaino earlier this week had declared : " temporarily , -lrb- the stability pact -rrb- is not the priority of priorities .
the priority is to save the world banking system and therefore save citizens ' savings . " the criteria , set out in the treaty of maastricht , aims for a national budget deficit totalling less than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and public debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp . the leaders at the meeting also called for an international conference on the financial crisis that would include the g8 countries and large developing economies such as china , india , brazil and south africa . " we will work with all major economies to rebuild the international banking system , " berlusconi told journalists when asked about the purpose of the meeting of the so-called g14 . sarkozy said the aim of the international conference would be to construct " the foundation of an entrepreneurial capitalism instead of a speculative capitalism .
we want to build the beginning of new financial world as they did in bretton woods . " the 1944 international meeting in bretton woods established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states . putting an end to golden handshakes the eu leaders also agreed to work to change to european accounting rules , increase regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds and alter the way executives are rewarded , in order to prevent the payment of " golden handshakes " - that is , exorbitant severance payments - to executives who have created risk for their companies . " executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year . " decisions made at saturday 's mini-summit are to be further elaborated at tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers and at the oct .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

5 , quoting from a letter written by joseph luns , the foreign minister at the time .
luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .
the letter was sent to the dutch ambassador to the united states , informing him of the official position of the ministry of education , art and science towards the anne frank house .
the newspaper said the letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's archives was being moved to a new home .
house narrowly escaped demolition according to the anne frank foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anne frank house is now a museum located on amsterdam 's prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book anne frank - " the dairy of a young girl " was published in 1947 .
in the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
since then it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every year .
anne frank was deported to the german concentration camp at belsen where she died in march 1945 at the age of 16 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

pending the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons , countries should not " develop , produce , test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons , " the resolution said .
israel is the only country in the region that is not a signatory to the npt and therefore accepts only limited iaea inspections .

" we 'll have to see how we can sweep together the pieces that have been dumped on our doorstep , " spokesman torsten albig said sunday , oct .
5 , a day after hre disclosed the collapse of a hoped-for government-backed bailout .
the german government and the banking industry had announced on september 29 a 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 50-billion -rrb- set of guarantees to enable hre to resume short-term lending .
but newspaper reports said the deal unravelled when several leading banks pulled out after discovering that hre 's troubles were more serious than first thought .
a spokesman for hre , which is listed on germany 's blue chip stock index dax , said the company was " working around the clock " with regulators , investors , shareholders and the government .
liquidity problems worsening at the same time he admitted the liquidity problems faced by hre 's irish subsidiary depfa , which triggered the current crisis , had worsened .

depfa 's business involves rounding up short-term money to lend long-term , typically to municipalities .
the banking crisis meant depfa could no longer obtain such funds .
the original bail-out required short-term credit of 15 billion euros and rolling long-term re-financing into the second half of next year totalling 35 billion euros .
the newspaper welt am sonntag said an inspection by deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , had revealed hre needed far more money short term than set out in the plan .
taxpayers worrried about cost the paper said the shortfall to the end of the year was up to 50 billion euros and to the end of 2009 it was 70 to 100 billion .
the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .

" executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year .

would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

meanwhile , berlin called for a solution after the collapse of hypo real estate 's bailout . " in the us , managers are held liable with their private assets .

hans-peter friedrich from the christian social union - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's cdu - also said managers should be taken to task , but added that personal liability should be limited to twice the annual salary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

4 , adopted a resolution calling on all states in the region to accept iaea inspections , and to accede and adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which bans the development of nuclear arms .
after two days of contentious discussions between arab and western countries over the wording of the resolution , 82 nations voted in favor , none against and 13 - including the united states and israel - abstained .
pending the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons , countries should not " develop , produce , test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons , " the resolution said .
israel is the only country in the region that is not a signatory to the npt and therefore accepts only limited iaea inspections .
its government is believed to have atomic weapons , but it neither confirms nor denies its military nuclear capacity as a matter of national policy .
on israel 's initiative , the conference also added an indirect reference to iran and syria to the resolution , calling on states in the region to comply with their obligations on cooperating with iaea inspections .
inconclusive nuclear reports from iran , syria the iaea has received intelligence from various countries indicating iran might have been involved in nuclear weapons research in the past .
tehran asserts it was never involved in military nuclear work .
in june , agency inspectors began probing a syrian site alleged to have been a secret nuclear reactor under construction .
after israel bombed the facility last year , the us provided the iaea with intelligence that started the investigation .
the inspector 's first investigations are still inconclusive .
damascus maintains the site was a civilian nuclear facility .
a separate draft resolution by arab countries expressing concern about israel 's nuclear capabilities narrowly escaped a vote , as a slight majority of mostly western iaea members opposed taking such a decision .
in past years , attempts to have such a resolution adopted also failed . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , adopted a resolution calling on all states in the region to accept iaea inspections , and to accede and adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which bans the development of nuclear arms .
after two days of contentious discussions between arab and western countries over the wording of the resolution , 82 nations voted in favor , none against and 13 - including the united states and israel - abstained .
pending the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons , countries should not " develop , produce , test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons , " the resolution said .
israel is the only country in the region that is not a signatory to the npt and therefore accepts only limited iaea inspections .
its government is believed to have atomic weapons , but it neither confirms nor denies its military nuclear capacity as a matter of national policy .
on israel 's initiative , the conference also added an indirect reference to iran and syria to the resolution , calling on states in the region to comply with their obligations on cooperating with iaea inspections .
inconclusive nuclear reports from iran , syria the iaea has received intelligence from various countries indicating iran might have been involved in nuclear weapons research in the past .
tehran asserts it was never involved in military nuclear work .
in june , agency inspectors began probing a syrian site alleged to have been a secret nuclear reactor under construction .
after israel bombed the facility last year , the us provided the iaea with intelligence that started the investigation .
the inspector 's first investigations are still inconclusive .
damascus maintains the site was a civilian nuclear facility .
a separate draft resolution by arab countries expressing concern about israel 's nuclear capabilities narrowly escaped a vote , as a slight majority of mostly western iaea members opposed taking such a decision .
in past years , attempts to have such a resolution adopted also failed . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .
france currently holds the 27-member bloc 's rotating presidency . a statement released after the talks said , " the application of the stability and growth pact should also reflect the current exceptional circumstances . "
the pact imposes rules public spending rules on eu member states , but includes a clause that allows countries flexibility in difficult situations . relaxing national budget regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel stood out in the crowd of political leaders this was a victory for sarkozy , whose closest advisor henry guaino earlier this week had declared : " temporarily , -lrb- the stability pact -rrb- is not the priority of priorities .
the priority is to save the world banking system and therefore save citizens ' savings . " the criteria , set out in the treaty of maastricht , aims for a national budget deficit totalling less than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and public debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp . the leaders at the meeting also called for an international conference on the financial crisis that would include the g8 countries and large developing economies such as china , india , brazil and south africa . " we will work with all major economies to rebuild the international banking system , " berlusconi told journalists when asked about the purpose of the meeting of the so-called g14 . sarkozy said the aim of the international conference would be to construct " the foundation of an entrepreneurial capitalism instead of a speculative capitalism .
we want to build the beginning of new financial world as they did in bretton woods . " the 1944 international meeting in bretton woods established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states . putting an end to golden handshakes the eu leaders also agreed to work to change to european accounting rules , increase regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds and alter the way executives are rewarded , in order to prevent the payment of " golden handshakes " - that is , exorbitant severance payments - to executives who have created risk for their companies . " executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year . " decisions made at saturday 's mini-summit are to be further elaborated at tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers and at the oct .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .
france currently holds the 27-member bloc 's rotating presidency . a statement released after the talks said , " the application of the stability and growth pact should also reflect the current exceptional circumstances . "
the pact imposes rules public spending rules on eu member states , but includes a clause that allows countries flexibility in difficult situations . relaxing national budget regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel stood out in the crowd of political leaders this was a victory for sarkozy , whose closest advisor henry guaino earlier this week had declared : " temporarily , -lrb- the stability pact -rrb- is not the priority of priorities .
the priority is to save the world banking system and therefore save citizens ' savings . " the criteria , set out in the treaty of maastricht , aims for a national budget deficit totalling less than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and public debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp . the leaders at the meeting also called for an international conference on the financial crisis that would include the g8 countries and large developing economies such as china , india , brazil and south africa . " we will work with all major economies to rebuild the international banking system , " berlusconi told journalists when asked about the purpose of the meeting of the so-called g14 . sarkozy said the aim of the international conference would be to construct " the foundation of an entrepreneurial capitalism instead of a speculative capitalism .
we want to build the beginning of new financial world as they did in bretton woods . " the 1944 international meeting in bretton woods established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states . putting an end to golden handshakes the eu leaders also agreed to work to change to european accounting rules , increase regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds and alter the way executives are rewarded , in order to prevent the payment of " golden handshakes " - that is , exorbitant severance payments - to executives who have created risk for their companies . " executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year . " decisions made at saturday 's mini-summit are to be further elaborated at tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers and at the oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

5 , quoting from a letter written by joseph luns , the foreign minister at the time .
luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .
the letter was sent to the dutch ambassador to the united states , informing him of the official position of the ministry of education , art and science towards the anne frank house .
the newspaper said the letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's archives was being moved to a new home .
house narrowly escaped demolition according to the anne frank foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anne frank house is now a museum located on amsterdam 's prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book anne frank - " the dairy of a young girl " was published in 1947 .
in the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
since then it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every year .
anne frank was deported to the german concentration camp at belsen where she died in march 1945 at the age of 16 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .
france currently holds the 27-member bloc 's rotating presidency . a statement released after the talks said , " the application of the stability and growth pact should also reflect the current exceptional circumstances . "
the pact imposes rules public spending rules on eu member states , but includes a clause that allows countries flexibility in difficult situations . relaxing national budget regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel stood out in the crowd of political leaders this was a victory for sarkozy , whose closest advisor henry guaino earlier this week had declared : " temporarily , -lrb- the stability pact -rrb- is not the priority of priorities .
the priority is to save the world banking system and therefore save citizens ' savings . " the criteria , set out in the treaty of maastricht , aims for a national budget deficit totalling less than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and public debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp . the leaders at the meeting also called for an international conference on the financial crisis that would include the g8 countries and large developing economies such as china , india , brazil and south africa . " we will work with all major economies to rebuild the international banking system , " berlusconi told journalists when asked about the purpose of the meeting of the so-called g14 . sarkozy said the aim of the international conference would be to construct " the foundation of an entrepreneurial capitalism instead of a speculative capitalism .
we want to build the beginning of new financial world as they did in bretton woods . " the 1944 international meeting in bretton woods established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states . putting an end to golden handshakes the eu leaders also agreed to work to change to european accounting rules , increase regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds and alter the way executives are rewarded , in order to prevent the payment of " golden handshakes " - that is , exorbitant severance payments - to executives who have created risk for their companies . " executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year . " decisions made at saturday 's mini-summit are to be further elaborated at tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers and at the oct .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?

how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

the german government and the banking industry had announced on september 29 a 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 50-billion -rrb- set of guarantees to enable hre to resume short-term lending .

" we 'll have to see how we can sweep together the pieces that have been dumped on our doorstep , " spokesman torsten albig said sunday , oct .
5 , a day after hre disclosed the collapse of a hoped-for government-backed bailout .
the german government and the banking industry had announced on september 29 a 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 50-billion -rrb- set of guarantees to enable hre to resume short-term lending .
but newspaper reports said the deal unravelled when several leading banks pulled out after discovering that hre 's troubles were more serious than first thought .
a spokesman for hre , which is listed on germany 's blue chip stock index dax , said the company was " working around the clock " with regulators , investors , shareholders and the government .
liquidity problems worsening at the same time he admitted the liquidity problems faced by hre 's irish subsidiary depfa , which triggered the current crisis , had worsened .

depfa 's business involves rounding up short-term money to lend long-term , typically to municipalities .
the banking crisis meant depfa could no longer obtain such funds .
the original bail-out required short-term credit of 15 billion euros and rolling long-term re-financing into the second half of next year totalling 35 billion euros .
the newspaper welt am sonntag said an inspection by deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , had revealed hre needed far more money short term than set out in the plan .
taxpayers worrried about cost the paper said the shortfall to the end of the year was up to 50 billion euros and to the end of 2009 it was 70 to 100 billion .
the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .
sources linked to the talks said the industry had initially demanded that berlin simply nationalize hre , as the united states did to fannie mae and freddie mac and britain did to bradford & bingley . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .

it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?

and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?

it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 05.10.2008 eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has been criticized for allegedly using food producing arable land for biofuel purposes dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu . after the european union reduced its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel as part of the its plan to fight climate change in september , questions on how this would affect the global production of biofuels began to arise .
would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .

" we 'll have to see how we can sweep together the pieces that have been dumped on our doorstep , " spokesman torsten albig said sunday , oct .
5 , a day after hre disclosed the collapse of a hoped-for government-backed bailout .
the german government and the banking industry had announced on september 29 a 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 50-billion -rrb- set of guarantees to enable hre to resume short-term lending .
but newspaper reports said the deal unravelled when several leading banks pulled out after discovering that hre 's troubles were more serious than first thought .
a spokesman for hre , which is listed on germany 's blue chip stock index dax , said the company was " working around the clock " with regulators , investors , shareholders and the government .
liquidity problems worsening at the same time he admitted the liquidity problems faced by hre 's irish subsidiary depfa , which triggered the current crisis , had worsened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government was to guarantee banks and insurance companies in the deal hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the past month .
depfa 's business involves rounding up short-term money to lend long-term , typically to municipalities .
the banking crisis meant depfa could no longer obtain such funds .
the original bail-out required short-term credit of 15 billion euros and rolling long-term re-financing into the second half of next year totalling 35 billion euros .
the newspaper welt am sonntag said an inspection by deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , had revealed hre needed far more money short term than set out in the plan .
taxpayers worrried about cost the paper said the shortfall to the end of the year was up to 50 billion euros and to the end of 2009 it was 70 to 100 billion .
the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .
sources linked to the talks said the industry had initially demanded that berlin simply nationalize hre , as the united states did to fannie mae and freddie mac and britain did to bradford & bingley . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liquidity problems worsening at the same time he admitted the liquidity problems faced by hre 's irish subsidiary depfa , which triggered the current crisis , had worsened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government was to guarantee banks and insurance companies in the deal hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the past month .
depfa 's business involves rounding up short-term money to lend long-term , typically to municipalities .
the banking crisis meant depfa could no longer obtain such funds .
the original bail-out required short-term credit of 15 billion euros and rolling long-term re-financing into the second half of next year totalling 35 billion euros .
the newspaper welt am sonntag said an inspection by deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , had revealed hre needed far more money short term than set out in the plan .
taxpayers worrried about cost the paper said the shortfall to the end of the year was up to 50 billion euros and to the end of 2009 it was 70 to 100 billion .
the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .
sources linked to the talks said the industry had initially demanded that berlin simply nationalize hre , as the united states did to fannie mae and freddie mac and britain did to bradford & bingley . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on israel 's initiative , the conference also added an indirect reference to iran and syria to the resolution , calling on states in the region to comply with their obligations on cooperating with iaea inspections .
inconclusive nuclear reports from iran , syria the iaea has received intelligence from various countries indicating iran might have been involved in nuclear weapons research in the past .
tehran asserts it was never involved in military nuclear work .
in june , agency inspectors began probing a syrian site alleged to have been a secret nuclear reactor under construction .
after israel bombed the facility last year , the us provided the iaea with intelligence that started the investigation .
the inspector 's first investigations are still inconclusive .
damascus maintains the site was a civilian nuclear facility .
a separate draft resolution by arab countries expressing concern about israel 's nuclear capabilities narrowly escaped a vote , as a slight majority of mostly western iaea members opposed taking such a decision .
in past years , attempts to have such a resolution adopted also failed . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .
additional notes and information : * dorneles claims that criticism of how biofuel production impacts food prices is not founded on scientific arguments and contains misconceptions .
he says : it does not distinguish the different raw materials used to produce ethanol .
it ignores the challenge of global warming and how to mitigate its effects .
it does not take into account how rising oil prices have impacted food prices .
it does not approach the effects of the us dollar devaluation and financial speculation over agricultural commodity prices .
it does not consider the impact of the fast growth in food demand in emerging economies .
it ignores adverse climatic conditions in agricultural nations .
it underestimates technological evolution .
it ignores the benefits that biofuel production may bring to developing countries , such as renewable energies , less oil imports , diversification of farmers ' income and job generation in rural areas . relevant data : • areas with rice crops were reduced by 50 percent between 1976 and 2007 , thus releasing approximately 3 million hectares for other crops . • even so , rice production increased by 50 pe cent in the same period , from 8 to 12 million tons , due to agricultural productivity gains . • coincidentally , areas with sugarcane crops for ethanol increased by 3 million hectares in the same period . • brazil 's production of grain crops and sugarcane grew by 217 pe cent from 1976 to 2007 .

would the change in focus to electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources , or second-generation biofuels from waste , have serious repercussions for nations like brazil which have heavily invested in biofuel technology and production ?
would the eu 's new stance create more friction in an already fractious debate where accusations of self-interest and protectionism are commonplace ?
ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , answers questions about his country 's ambitions in the industry , its production practices and brazil 's role in the international debate .
dw-world.de : what are the levels of cooperation between brazil and europe in biofuel production ?
in which areas is cooperation more productive ?
ricardo dorneles : the biofuel cooperation between brazil and the european union has come to a halt now because of the eu 's policies on producing and using biofuel in its market .
talks on the directive that aims at revising biofuel targets , as well as adopting environmental criteria , have taken over the debate and harmed the progress of cooperation projects .
because of brazil 's initiative in the international biofuels forum , which congregates the world 's main biofuel producers and consumers , the area of cooperation that has seen greater advances lately is the assessment of conditions for aligning metrological standards for biofuels in brazil , the united states and the european union .
what are the main conflict areas between europe and brazil in biofuel production ?
the european union 's subsidies for agricultural products and non-tariff barriers to brazilian biofuels have been obstacles to a commercial integration between brazil and the european bloc .
what are the differences in biofuel production and promotion between brazil and europe ?
in brazil , biofuels are produced based on free enterprise and supported and promoted by the government , especially in international forums by means of the presidential diplomacy .
the president always emphasizes his support for producing biofuels as a means towards development and an option for poorer nations .
the european union has lowered its target for using traditional biofuels from crops in petrol and diesel , with a view to using more second generation biofuels and other renewable resources .
how will that affect brazil and its biofuel industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to use less first generation biofuel several governmental and private studies conducted by specialized agencies , such as epe , embrapa and ctc , and by universities such as unicamp and coppe , have demonstrated that brazil has all the conditions to expand its biofuel production to levels much higher than currently seen .
there is land , agricultural technology and industrial technology for the nation to meet consumption without harming food supply and the increase in grain crops , as demonstrated in the latest years .
research is also being conducted to produce biofuels from cellulose materials , and a significant productivity gain is expected in the transformation of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol .
how does brazil intend to reinforce and improve its position as the world 's second biggest ethanol exporter ?
does brazil intend to become the world 's biggest exporter of ethanol ?
brazil is currently the world 's second biggest ethanol producer and the biggest exporter .
however , the biggest goal in brazil 's biofuel policy is to promote international cooperation so that as many nations as possible may produce biofuels , which will increase the likelihood of commoditization .
brazil has been doing its part by signing cooperation agreements with nations from all continents , without any distinction , to promote biofuel production .
brazil understands that diversifying energy sources is key to reducing dependency on fossil fuels , which are becoming more and more expensive .
and biofuels may certainly play an important role in this process .
how is the brazilian government considering the potential environmental and economic costs of seeking ethanol production on a bigger scale ?
what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil claims it does not need to claim land from the amazon brazil still has a huge agricultural frontier that can be used without compromising sensitive biomes such as the amazon or the pantanal .
livestock raising in brazil is extensive and under-utilizes the land ; breeding the livestock at a density much below the levels that can be reached to obtain greater productivity .
as a consequence , degraded pastures can be released for sugarcane plantations in areas where new units are being built , or where existing ones are being expanded .
the agro-ecological zoning studies for sugarcane in brazil will be published soon .
in practice , it will be an essential step to guide production expansion and ensure its sustainability . a recent report said that brazil 's biofuel production will not affect food production or the amazon deforestation in the next years .
however , farmers are being encouraged to grow sugarcane for biofuels in the land formerly used for food crops .
what 's brazil status concerning expanding sugarcane crops for biofuel ?
what underlies the argument that it is not the reason for the food crisis ?
is the amazon rainforest under threat ?
it should always be taken into account that there will be some economic incentive to guide farmers ' decisions on to how to use the land .
however , in some cases the tradition or economic vocation of a certain region may preponderate and influence farmers ' decisions .
their decisions are also influenced by other factors not under their control .
for example , it would not make sense to grow sugarcane on their land , regardless of the crop 's financial yield , unless there is a nearby industrial unit capable of absorbing their production .
the agro-ecological zoning studies to be released may come to demonstrate what is already known - brazil has spare land to expand sugarcane production and still increase food and grain crop production without compromising or threatening sensitive ecosystems and biomes such as the amazon and the pantanal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil has seen increases in both food and biofuel production the main justification , from brazil 's point of view , for the inexistence of a threat to food crops is the fact that , in the latest harvests , an increase was seen in the production of raw material for biofuel and production and also an increase in the production of food and seed crops offered on the market .
the threats to the amazon region are of a nature completely unrelated to the increase in biofuel production in brazil .
linking both means could seriously harm the search for solutions aimed at maintaining the amazon 's biodiversity . * see additional notes below .
environmentalists say that biofuel production in europe and brazil is benefitting big businesses rather than local communities .
particularly , brazil is being accused of increasing production to meet demand at the detriment of farms and of having four in ten ethanol producers backed by foreign investors .
how do you respond to those accusations ?
the energy market is one of the world 's most income-concentrating markets .
there is an undeniable income concentration in rich nations because of the energy market , which is strongly based on petroleum economics .
biofuels are a viable option to reduce fossil fuel dependency and keep money local , which certainly contributes to the local economy .
in the case of brazil , the sugarcane industry is made up of more than 400 production units owned by more than 200 business groups .
more than 60,000 sugarcane farmers are involved in the supply chain , and more than one million direct jobs are generated .

the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .
sources linked to the talks said the industry had initially demanded that berlin simply nationalize hre , as the united states did to fannie mae and freddie mac and britain did to bradford & bingley . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .

the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .

" we 'll have to see how we can sweep together the pieces that have been dumped on our doorstep , " spokesman torsten albig said sunday , oct .
5 , a day after hre disclosed the collapse of a hoped-for government-backed bailout .
the german government and the banking industry had announced on september 29 a 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 50-billion -rrb- set of guarantees to enable hre to resume short-term lending .
but newspaper reports said the deal unravelled when several leading banks pulled out after discovering that hre 's troubles were more serious than first thought .
a spokesman for hre , which is listed on germany 's blue chip stock index dax , said the company was " working around the clock " with regulators , investors , shareholders and the government .
liquidity problems worsening at the same time he admitted the liquidity problems faced by hre 's irish subsidiary depfa , which triggered the current crisis , had worsened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government was to guarantee banks and insurance companies in the deal hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the past month .
depfa 's business involves rounding up short-term money to lend long-term , typically to municipalities .
the banking crisis meant depfa could no longer obtain such funds .
the original bail-out required short-term credit of 15 billion euros and rolling long-term re-financing into the second half of next year totalling 35 billion euros .
the newspaper welt am sonntag said an inspection by deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , had revealed hre needed far more money short term than set out in the plan .
taxpayers worrried about cost the paper said the shortfall to the end of the year was up to 50 billion euros and to the end of 2009 it was 70 to 100 billion .
the bailout plan had apportioned a loan requirement of 15 billion euros to other banks and 20 billion euros to the bundesbank , the german central bank .
the guarantees backing the total were differently apportioned , with the german federal government playing backstop for 26.5 billion euros of the total and the finance industry giving its word for 8.5 million .
the bailout has caused political controversy in germany , with some opposition groups questioning why the government is risking taxpayers funds to save hre .
sources linked to the talks said the industry had initially demanded that berlin simply nationalize hre , as the united states did to fannie mae and freddie mac and britain did to bradford & bingley . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

each country is responsible for its own banks - but should n't act without consulting the other eu members , they said . the current financial crisis was so severe that governments should be allowed to breach deficit limits to rescue the banking system , agreed the leaders of europe 's largest economies at an emergency summit in paris late saturday , oct .
4 . french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also called for an international conference of the 14 largest industrial nations to " rebuild the international finance system , " as sarkozy phrased it . also attending the mini-summit of the eu 's four members of the g8 group of industrial nations were european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . the meeting was called by sarkozy to formulate a common european position to surmount the finance crisis .
france currently holds the 27-member bloc 's rotating presidency . a statement released after the talks said , " the application of the stability and growth pact should also reflect the current exceptional circumstances . "
the pact imposes rules public spending rules on eu member states , but includes a clause that allows countries flexibility in difficult situations . relaxing national budget regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel stood out in the crowd of political leaders this was a victory for sarkozy , whose closest advisor henry guaino earlier this week had declared : " temporarily , -lrb- the stability pact -rrb- is not the priority of priorities .
the priority is to save the world banking system and therefore save citizens ' savings . " the criteria , set out in the treaty of maastricht , aims for a national budget deficit totalling less than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and public debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp . the leaders at the meeting also called for an international conference on the financial crisis that would include the g8 countries and large developing economies such as china , india , brazil and south africa . " we will work with all major economies to rebuild the international banking system , " berlusconi told journalists when asked about the purpose of the meeting of the so-called g14 . sarkozy said the aim of the international conference would be to construct " the foundation of an entrepreneurial capitalism instead of a speculative capitalism .
we want to build the beginning of new financial world as they did in bretton woods . " the 1944 international meeting in bretton woods established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states . putting an end to golden handshakes the eu leaders also agreed to work to change to european accounting rules , increase regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds and alter the way executives are rewarded , in order to prevent the payment of " golden handshakes " - that is , exorbitant severance payments - to executives who have created risk for their companies . " executives who failed must be penalized , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irresponsible finance managers should be held responsible , said the leaders the summit was preceded by a controversy over a proposal to create a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 413-billion -rrb- fund to bail out struggling financial institutions , similar to the plan passed by the us house of representatives and signed into law by president george w. bush late friday . reportedly supported by the dutch and the french , the idea was summarily rejected by germany and britain , and was not on the summit 's agenda . sarkozy told journalists that the idea was not his .
" i never assumed it , i never proposed it , i never imagined it , " sarkozy said . criticism for ireland 's unilateral action instead , in line with german and british wishes , each eu member state is to aid its troubled banks with its own funds - but after discussions with other countries .
this phrase was added as a reference to the unilateral decision by the irish government to establish a 100-percent guarantee for depositors in the six largest irish-owned banks . the move , made without consultation with the european commission , has already pushed investors away from british banks , and has put pressure on the brown government to match it . merkel said that the european commission and the ecb would talk to the irish about their move , which contravenes the eu 's state aid and competition requirements . " but my satisfaction about -lrb- this solution -rrb- is limited , " the german chancellor said . the leaders concluded that greater cooperation was necessary between eu economies , and demanded the " immediate establishment of colleges or supervisors to oversee cross border institutions . " barroso said that legislation aimed at improving current rules of deposits and aligning the national systems would be launched " before the end of the year . " decisions made at saturday 's mini-summit are to be further elaborated at tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers and at the oct .

4 , adopted a resolution calling on all states in the region to accept iaea inspections , and to accede and adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which bans the development of nuclear arms .
after two days of contentious discussions between arab and western countries over the wording of the resolution , 82 nations voted in favor , none against and 13 - including the united states and israel - abstained .
pending the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons , countries should not " develop , produce , test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons , " the resolution said .
israel is the only country in the region that is not a signatory to the npt and therefore accepts only limited iaea inspections .
its government is believed to have atomic weapons , but it neither confirms nor denies its military nuclear capacity as a matter of national policy .
on israel 's initiative , the conference also added an indirect reference to iran and syria to the resolution , calling on states in the region to comply with their obligations on cooperating with iaea inspections .
inconclusive nuclear reports from iran , syria the iaea has received intelligence from various countries indicating iran might have been involved in nuclear weapons research in the past .
tehran asserts it was never involved in military nuclear work .
in june , agency inspectors began probing a syrian site alleged to have been a secret nuclear reactor under construction .
after israel bombed the facility last year , the us provided the iaea with intelligence that started the investigation .
the inspector 's first investigations are still inconclusive .
damascus maintains the site was a civilian nuclear facility .
a separate draft resolution by arab countries expressing concern about israel 's nuclear capabilities narrowly escaped a vote , as a slight majority of mostly western iaea members opposed taking such a decision .
in past years , attempts to have such a resolution adopted also failed . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , quoting from a letter written by joseph luns , the foreign minister at the time .
luns said the house where anne and her family hid from 1942 until her betrayal in 1944 was " not an historical monument of the netherlands " and unremarkable from an architectural point of view .
the letter was sent to the dutch ambassador to the united states , informing him of the official position of the ministry of education , art and science towards the anne frank house .
the newspaper said the letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's archives was being moved to a new home .
house narrowly escaped demolition according to the anne frank foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anne frank house is now a museum located on amsterdam 's prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book anne frank - " the dairy of a young girl " was published in 1947 .
in the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
the firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the anne frank foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
since then it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every year .
anne frank was deported to the german concentration camp at belsen where she died in march 1945 at the age of 16 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

place the barley in the bottom of the large jar .
crush one of the whole cabbage leaves on a chopping board without tearing it .
then place it on top of the barley in the jar and press it down by hand . chop the cabbage into long strips and put it in a bowl .
sprinkle with salt and add the junipers .
press the cabbage down with your hand and crush it with the pestle .
when the cabbage starts to produce liquid , put it into the jar on top of the crushed leaf . let it stand for one hour , then go back and put pressure on it .
if the volume of the cabbage decreases , repeat the process of finely chopping more cabbage , add salt and juniper and compress it into a bowl .
leave it until it releases liquid and then add it into the jar .
let it stand for another hour and continue the same way until the jar is full .
to finish , add the remaining leaf , which should also be crushed , but still whole . place a cloth on top of the second leaf .
fill the small jar with water and put it on top of the large jar so that it is pressing down on the contents of the large jar .
it should be kept at a cool temperature .
after four days take off the small jar and the cloth , wash the cloth and the outside of the small jar .
remove the mold that should have formed , then cover it again with the cloth and put the small jar full of water back on top .
press down so that the juice that has formed covers the top layer of the contents .
repeat this operation every two days until no more mold forms .
press down the small jar from time to time . after around ten days -lrb- or up to 15 days at a very cold temperature -rrb- , when the cabbage is of a soft consistency and has a distinct taste , you can finalize the process .
take away the small jar , remove the cloth and the large leaf .
pack the cabbage into smaller jars and put them in the fridge .
if mold still forms , remove the mold and press down the cabbage . guten appetit ! dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
