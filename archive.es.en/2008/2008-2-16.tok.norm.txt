a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .
the greek community in berlin , with the help of the local government , has established two bilingual schools . for the past 40 years , the greek community and educational experts have debated the pros and cons of greek schools in germany .
but the most telling fact is reflected in statistics : they show that 80 percent of all students of greek origin in germany attend a german school . stamatis assimenios -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations .

" these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .

team officials said legal action is underway to fight what they called the defamation of clean athletes . stefan schwarzbach , spokesman for the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- , said on saturday , feb .
16 , that all athletes have promised to sign a revised sworn statement that they have never used banned substances or other illegal methods . schwarzbach confirmed that former stars uschi disl , katrin apel , sven fischer and ricco gross - who all won olympic and world championship gold medals - were named in a list that has surfaced allegedly in connection with a latest doping probe in austria . " this is false and we are 100 percent behind -lsb- our athletes -rsb- , " schwarzbach said .
" our athletes , three weeks ago , signed a declaration with our lawyers in which they claim they have never had any link with this laboratory . " he said all athletes were informed again that lying in the statement could result in imprisonment of up to three years . a " witch hunt " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathletes said they 've never doped fischer , a tv expert for public broadcaster zdf at the current world championships in ostersund , said : " i have done nothing in my career ...
i am clean . " schwarzbach spoke of " a witch hunt " and said the dsv will take legal action in the latest affair . " we will institute legal proceedings against unknown persons for slander , " he said .
" this is our strongest weapon . " german men 's team coach frank ullrich said : " this is defamation ...
i stand behind my team . " the current team members could not be reached for comments immediately because of the day 's races .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .

16 .
the riots have been attributed by police mainly to groups with an immigration background . " in copenhagen there were 28 cars set on fire , 35 dumpsters and 14 garbage fires in the streets , " copenhagen police chief inspector lau thytesen told the afp news agency . five arrested suspects were due to face a custodial judge on saturday .
some 50 people have been arrested in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests started before newspapers reprinted caricatures of the prophet mohammed justice minister lene espersen has called for tough measures against the rioting youths .
earlier in the week , police and fire fighters were confronted with stone throwing and molotov cocktails in the capital . on friday a 15-year-old was sentenced to two weeks in custody because he had spoken out on public television for a continuation of the riots .
the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion . " when police choose to stop everyone with arab features or the wrong skin color while they let other people pass by , it 's not about a specific effort anymore .
it 's about racism , " rasmus lingnau amossen , who was among the participants of a peaceful demonstration on friday , told daily politiken . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.02.2008 germany 's greek community faces school dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what language should these turkish students in germany be instructed in ?
a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .
the greek community in berlin , with the help of the local government , has established two bilingual schools . for the past 40 years , the greek community and educational experts have debated the pros and cons of greek schools in germany .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .
" it will be a challenge for serbia , but also for the eu and the international community . " dw staff -lrb- sp / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation .

" these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .

" -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .

some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .

" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .

over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .
the greek community in berlin , with the help of the local government , has established two bilingual schools . for the past 40 years , the greek community and educational experts have debated the pros and cons of greek schools in germany .
but the most telling fact is reflected in statistics : they show that 80 percent of all students of greek origin in germany attend a german school . stamatis assimenios -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.02.2008 germany 's greek community faces school dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what language should these turkish students in germany be instructed in ?
a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .

the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion .

" the bank thought that all the material had been returned but realized in 2007 that client data might have been " passed on illegally to third parties . " a finance ministry spokesman on friday declined to comment on precisely who was under investigation , saying only that they were " known and unknown , especially people whose revenues are at the high end of the scale . " the sueddeutsche zeitung reported , however , that no other board members of firms listed in the dax , germany 's leading share index , were targeted . the affair erupted after a prosecutor in the western city of bochum announced that deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel was suspected of involvement in a case of tax fraud .

the riots have been attributed by police mainly to groups with an immigration background . " in copenhagen there were 28 cars set on fire , 35 dumpsters and 14 garbage fires in the streets , " copenhagen police chief inspector lau thytesen told the afp news agency . five arrested suspects were due to face a custodial judge on saturday .
some 50 people have been arrested in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests started before newspapers reprinted caricatures of the prophet mohammed justice minister lene espersen has called for tough measures against the rioting youths .
earlier in the week , police and fire fighters were confronted with stone throwing and molotov cocktails in the capital . on friday a 15-year-old was sentenced to two weeks in custody because he had spoken out on public television for a continuation of the riots .
the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion . " when police choose to stop everyone with arab features or the wrong skin color while they let other people pass by , it 's not about a specific effort anymore .
it 's about racism , " rasmus lingnau amossen , who was among the participants of a peaceful demonstration on friday , told daily politiken . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .

some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .

" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .

" -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .

some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .

" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.02.2008 germany 's greek community faces school dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what language should these turkish students in germany be instructed in ?
a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .

" germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .

over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .

it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .

" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .

" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .
" it will be a challenge for serbia , but also for the eu and the international community . " dw staff -lrb- sp / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.02.2008 germany 's greek community faces school dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what language should these turkish students in germany be instructed in ?
a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .
the greek community in berlin , with the help of the local government , has established two bilingual schools . for the past 40 years , the greek community and educational experts have debated the pros and cons of greek schools in germany .
but the most telling fact is reflected in statistics : they show that 80 percent of all students of greek origin in germany attend a german school . stamatis assimenios -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investigators said they 're examining some 700 cases of tax evasion that could total over 3 billion euros . economy minister michael glos called on business leaders to adopt ethical behavior and get rid of their bad habits , in an interview to appear sunday in the bild am sonntag tabloid . they should " be aware of their function as a model for society , " he said .
" otherwise our social market economy will no longer be credible . " weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , in its edition to appear monday , quoted interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as saying managers did not realize the consequence of their actions . " these people are destroying everything , " he told the magazine .
" when the elite do not understand that they must respect the law , it is serious . " finance minister peer steinbrueck also accused tax evaders of harming germany 's social system . " the economic elites are undermining the system , " he told the online version of the weekly die zeit on friday . hundreds of search warrants issued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tax office may be getting a lot more paperwork in the next few months munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that investigators in bochum , where the cases are being managed , had requested a total of 900 search warrants for 700 people suspected of hiding a total of 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- from tax authorities . officials said friday they were investigating hundreds of cases of tax evasion , including key figures , via banks in the tiny principality wedged between austria and switzerland . der spiegel reported that investigators paid 5 millions of euros -lrb- 7.3 million -rrb- for secret bank data from liechtenstein enabling them to launch the monster tax evasion probe .
the money was reportedly supplied by german intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- and paid to an informer in 2006 . in the end , the money was deposited in an account in exchange for data identifying those behind the tax fraud in germany but also including secret instructions from liechtenstein on how to hide the flow of money . suspects at high end of income scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank said it would start warning customers liechtenstein 's lgt bank group , which was named in press reports as a focus of the probes , said saturday that it appeared the german authorities were working from client information stolen in 2002 . spokesman hans-martin uehlinger said the list would contain " several hundred names , " adding , " we are going to warn all our clients who are on this list . " the bank thought that all the material had been returned but realized in 2007 that client data might have been " passed on illegally to third parties . " a finance ministry spokesman on friday declined to comment on precisely who was under investigation , saying only that they were " known and unknown , especially people whose revenues are at the high end of the scale . " the sueddeutsche zeitung reported , however , that no other board members of firms listed in the dax , germany 's leading share index , were targeted . the affair erupted after a prosecutor in the western city of bochum announced that deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel was suspected of involvement in a case of tax fraud .

16 .
the riots have been attributed by police mainly to groups with an immigration background . " in copenhagen there were 28 cars set on fire , 35 dumpsters and 14 garbage fires in the streets , " copenhagen police chief inspector lau thytesen told the afp news agency . five arrested suspects were due to face a custodial judge on saturday .
some 50 people have been arrested in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests started before newspapers reprinted caricatures of the prophet mohammed justice minister lene espersen has called for tough measures against the rioting youths .
earlier in the week , police and fire fighters were confronted with stone throwing and molotov cocktails in the capital . on friday a 15-year-old was sentenced to two weeks in custody because he had spoken out on public television for a continuation of the riots .
the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion . " when police choose to stop everyone with arab features or the wrong skin color while they let other people pass by , it 's not about a specific effort anymore .

a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany . " the situation today is much more complex , " said konstantin dimitriou , chairman of the association of greek communities in germany . dimitriou said that greece 's entry into the european union had significantly changed the migration patterns of greeks , making them much more mobile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrant workers poured into germany in the 1960s and 1970s " thousands of temporary greek migrants came and still come to germany with their children , work for two or three years , largely in greek-owned businesses , and then they return home , " dimitriou said .
" the greek schools cater to this mobility .
it allows the children of temporary migrant workers to integrate without problems in a greek school when they return home . " at the same time , many greek immigrants in germany are here to stay and have no plans of returning .
dimitriou pointed to the above average number of jobless and professionally unqualified students who complete greek schools in germany .
on account of their curriculum , the schools are n't geared towards greek children who live permanently in germany , dimitriou said . greek schools in need of reform the view is echoed by wasilios fthenakis , a famous greek educational expert and consultant for several state governments in germany .
fthenakis said the greek school system could not be generally written off but underlined that it needed reform . " we need a program that does n't stick to the national curriculum of the country of origin but rather one that can meet the specific needs of these children , " he said .
" that has to include culture and mother tongue but also take account of the demands of the german school system . " experts say there are n't any easy answers to the dilemma of greek immigrants . " usually , greek families have high expectations of their children in education , " said dimitriou , who added he would like to send his son to a bilingual greek-german school . " the fact that the german educational system is not very open to immigrant children led greek parents and communities to look for alternatives , " he said .
" the greek schools are one , but not the only alternative . " german schools ' the best ? many parents invest a lot of money in tuition and special lessons for their children within the german system , dimitriou pointed out .
the greek community in berlin , with the help of the local government , has established two bilingual schools . for the past 40 years , the greek community and educational experts have debated the pros and cons of greek schools in germany .
but the most telling fact is reflected in statistics : they show that 80 percent of all students of greek origin in germany attend a german school . stamatis assimenios -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.02.2008 germany 's greek community faces school dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what language should these turkish students in germany be instructed in ?
a recent proposal to set up turkish-medium schools in germany was strongly criticized by politicians .
the response ignores the fact that one immigrant group in germany , the greeks , has for decades had its own schools . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan ruffled feathers on a recent trip to germany when he proposed setting up turkish-language schools and universities in the country .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - some 2.5 million .
turkey could also send over teachers to germany , erdogan suggested . while his comments triggered criticism by germany 's politicians and rekindled a debate on integrating immigrants into society , sending children of immigrant background to a school that teaches in their mother tongue is not as unusual as the row suggests . germany 's greek immigrant community has for decades had the option of sending their children to greek schools where the curriculum is set by the greek state and where greek is the language of instruction .
every fifth of an estimated 47,000 students of greek origin attends one of 35 greek schools in germany . most students switch to the greek school system after secondary school with the aim of getting a greek high school diploma and thus securing a place at a greek university . serving a practical purpose michael damanakis of the university of crete in greece , a former teacher in a greek school in germany in the 1970s , said the schools had little to do with preserving the national identity of germany 's greek immigrants , many of whom came to the country in the 1960s to fill a demand for cheap labor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's school system has been criticized for failing to offer equal chances " they -lsb- the schools -rsb- serve a practical purpose , " damanakis said .
" the parents simply want to make use of the easier conditions of the greek school system to get a place at a university for their children , something that the german school system does n't allow because of its structure . " germany 's three-tiered school system , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , has been widely criticized by educational experts .
a slew of international studies have found fault with the system which they say discriminates in particular against children from immigrant backgrounds . damanakis however pointed out those greek schools in germany could n't be the answer . " greek schools in germany have no credible legitimacy from an education viewpoint , " he said .
" these schools separate greek children from germans and other nationalities and you should n't forget that the segregation of minorities , whether ethnic or social , leads to marginalization and unequal opportunities in the long-term . " " a more complex situation today " the first greek schools in germany were founded in the 1960s .
over a million greeks came to germany between 1959 and 1990 , according to statistics .
around 800,000 returned to greece after a short or long-term stay in germany .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .

16 , approved sending a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to the province . the eu civil mission was formally approved at midnight on friday , after none of the 27 bloc members objected to the mission 's plan , which represents the eu 's biggest civilian mission ever . an emergency session of the parliament has been called in pristina , with the declaration of independence expected at on sunday afternoon . " -lsb- sunday -rsb- will be a day of calm , of understanding , and of state engagements for the implementation of the will of the citizens of kosovo , " kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci told reporters on saturday . once kosovar leaders declare independence , the eu will take over responsibility for supervising police , judicial and civil administration from the current un mission after a 120-day transition period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of kosovo 's ethnic albanians are in favor of independence from serbia " it is already more or less clear , " slovenian prime minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu presidency , told a polish daily dziennik in an interview published on friday .
" the european union will send a mission to kosovo to replace the united nations . " serbia and russia both strongly oppose the mission , saying it would be illegal without the backing of an explicit mandate from the un security council . kosovo serb leader milan ivanovic on saturday called the eu 's police and justice mission a form of " occupation . " " in essence , the mission has characteristics of the occupation and it will be accepted neither by serbia nor by the serbs in kosovo , " ivanovic told the afp news agency .
" the eu mission is not welcome .
we will boycott it and use all methods of civic resistance . " ethnic serbs make up about 120,000 of kosovo 's 1.8 million people and want to stay part of serbia .
kosovo has been under un administration for 10 years since a nato bombing campaign ended ethnic violence there . easing the road to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in kosovo the eu 's mission , slated to cost 205 million euros -lrb- $ 301 million -rrb- for the initial 16 months , will consist of a political entity to supervise the transfer of powers from the un mission to the local authorities . eu experts will train and mentor police , justice and customs officials and have wide-ranging legal powers for the transition period .
some 100 members of an advanced planning team are already in pristina . in launching the mission , the eu officially appointed retired french general yves de kermabon to head it , and named dutch ambassador pieter feith as special eu representative . " these appointments further illustrate the eu 's enhanced engagement in the western balkans , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the european commission and the world bank are also planning an international donors ' conference to help build kosovo 's economy .
kosovo , which will not be admitted to the united nations because of russian and serbian opposition to its independence , faces huge challenges to tackle mass unemployment and become a viable state . the eu rejects russian arguments that the eu presence will be illegal .
it argues the existing un security council resolution 1244 on kosovo provides a legal basis for the mission and cites a jan .
3 report by un secretary-general ban ki-moon noting the eu 's readiness to play " an enhanced role . " not speaking with one voice ? though most eu states as well as the united states plan to recognize kosovo , at least six eu members - cyprus , greece , slovakia , spain , bulgaria and romania - have said they will not do so immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members agree kosovo 's future should be democratic , stable and multi-ethnic " our position remains the same : we will not recognize a unilateral declaration of independence , " cypriot foreign minister erato kozakou marcoullis told reuters news agency .
" our position is based on principles of the un charter , the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the un security council . " kosovo , home to 2 million ethnic albanians , has raised fears in some european capitals that separatist movements in their countries may use the serbian province as a precedent for their own unilateral decelerations of independence . eu supporters of kosovar independence say serbia has no moral right to rule the province because of the brutality it perpetrated against the province 's ethnic albanian majority under the late slobodan milosevic . rupel sought to play down differences in the eu over recognizing kosovo . " it is not the independence declaration that is most important , " he said .
" of course , there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries .
but there are not that many after all .
when the moment comes , i think the eu will speak with one voice . " serbia remains opposed serbia , backed by russia , has vowed that it will never accept kosovo 's independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has pledged never to recognise kosovo 's independence on friday , boris tadic who was sworn in as president of serbia reiterated his opposition . " i will never give up fighting for our kosovo and i will , with all my might , fight for serbia to join the european union , " tadic said . tadic is at odds with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica over serbia continuing to pursue eu membership if eu states approve kosovo 's secession . kostunica called the eu 's mission plans as a " brutal violation " of international law , and his government has already officially " annulled " in advance kosovo 's independence move . but tadic has said serbia would risk losing its international influence if it cut ties to countries and institutions that recognize kosovo . " if some countries , including some european union members , recognize kosovo , it is in my opinion that we will certainly enter a frozen conflict , " he said .

team officials said legal action is underway to fight what they called the defamation of clean athletes . stefan schwarzbach , spokesman for the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- , said on saturday , feb .
16 , that all athletes have promised to sign a revised sworn statement that they have never used banned substances or other illegal methods . schwarzbach confirmed that former stars uschi disl , katrin apel , sven fischer and ricco gross - who all won olympic and world championship gold medals - were named in a list that has surfaced allegedly in connection with a latest doping probe in austria . " this is false and we are 100 percent behind -lsb- our athletes -rsb- , " schwarzbach said .
" our athletes , three weeks ago , signed a declaration with our lawyers in which they claim they have never had any link with this laboratory . " he said all athletes were informed again that lying in the statement could result in imprisonment of up to three years . a " witch hunt " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathletes said they 've never doped fischer , a tv expert for public broadcaster zdf at the current world championships in ostersund , said : " i have done nothing in my career ...
i am clean . " schwarzbach spoke of " a witch hunt " and said the dsv will take legal action in the latest affair . " we will institute legal proceedings against unknown persons for slander , " he said .
" this is our strongest weapon . " german men 's team coach frank ullrich said : " this is defamation ...
i stand behind my team . " the current team members could not be reached for comments immediately because of the day 's races .
schwarzbach did not say who was on the list , but named the atmosphere " subdued " after the athletes were informed on friday night . anonymous tip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials said team members are being falsely targeted for doping austria 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- started a formal investigation after it received anonymous information regarding illegal blood doping practices . the austrian apa news agency reported that the anonymous tip contained information accusing 31 athletes , mainly from the field of endurance sports and including several olympic champions , of blood doping and connected insurance fraud . apa said 16 austrian and 15 foreign athletes , 10 of them german , had been named in the letter .
the tiroler tageszeitung said on thursday that three doctors were also involved . the probe comes a few weeks after a vienna blood bank was linked with blood doping practices .
this issue prompted a first written statement from the german biathlon team that they had nothing to do with this issue . the vienna laboratory accused , humanplasma , has denied the accusations , which appeared for the first time in 2007 , and sued for defamation . it is not known whether the two cases are linked . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the riots have been attributed by police mainly to groups with an immigration background . " in copenhagen there were 28 cars set on fire , 35 dumpsters and 14 garbage fires in the streets , " copenhagen police chief inspector lau thytesen told the afp news agency . five arrested suspects were due to face a custodial judge on saturday .

earlier in the week , police and fire fighters were confronted with stone throwing and molotov cocktails in the capital . on friday a 15-year-old was sentenced to two weeks in custody because he had spoken out on public television for a continuation of the riots .
the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion . " when police choose to stop everyone with arab features or the wrong skin color while they let other people pass by , it 's not about a specific effort anymore .

16 .
the riots have been attributed by police mainly to groups with an immigration background . " in copenhagen there were 28 cars set on fire , 35 dumpsters and 14 garbage fires in the streets , " copenhagen police chief inspector lau thytesen told the afp news agency . five arrested suspects were due to face a custodial judge on saturday .
some 50 people have been arrested in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests started before newspapers reprinted caricatures of the prophet mohammed justice minister lene espersen has called for tough measures against the rioting youths .
earlier in the week , police and fire fighters were confronted with stone throwing and molotov cocktails in the capital . on friday a 15-year-old was sentenced to two weeks in custody because he had spoken out on public television for a continuation of the riots .
the youths , who have acted in small groups with no apparent organization , have not explicitly spoken out about their motive . the riots , which had broken out before the renewed dispute over the controversial mohammed cartoons published in numerous danish newspapers , are thought to be connected to new regulations allowing police to conduct random searches for weapons in parts of copenhagen without suspicion . " when police choose to stop everyone with arab features or the wrong skin color while they let other people pass by , it 's not about a specific effort anymore .
it 's about racism , " rasmus lingnau amossen , who was among the participants of a peaceful demonstration on friday , told daily politiken . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is false and we are 100 percent behind -lsb- our athletes -rsb- , " schwarzbach said .
" our athletes , three weeks ago , signed a declaration with our lawyers in which they claim they have never had any link with this laboratory . " he said all athletes were informed again that lying in the statement could result in imprisonment of up to three years . a " witch hunt " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathletes said they 've never doped fischer , a tv expert for public broadcaster zdf at the current world championships in ostersund , said : " i have done nothing in my career ...

" this is our strongest weapon . " german men 's team coach frank ullrich said : " this is defamation ...

the tiroler tageszeitung said on thursday that three doctors were also involved . the probe comes a few weeks after a vienna blood bank was linked with blood doping practices .
this issue prompted a first written statement from the german biathlon team that they had nothing to do with this issue . the vienna laboratory accused , humanplasma , has denied the accusations , which appeared for the first time in 2007 , and sued for defamation . it is not known whether the two cases are linked . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investigators said they 're examining some 700 cases of tax evasion that could total over 3 billion euros . economy minister michael glos called on business leaders to adopt ethical behavior and get rid of their bad habits , in an interview to appear sunday in the bild am sonntag tabloid . they should " be aware of their function as a model for society , " he said .
" otherwise our social market economy will no longer be credible . " weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , in its edition to appear monday , quoted interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as saying managers did not realize the consequence of their actions . " these people are destroying everything , " he told the magazine .
" when the elite do not understand that they must respect the law , it is serious . " finance minister peer steinbrueck also accused tax evaders of harming germany 's social system . " the economic elites are undermining the system , " he told the online version of the weekly die zeit on friday . hundreds of search warrants issued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tax office may be getting a lot more paperwork in the next few months munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that investigators in bochum , where the cases are being managed , had requested a total of 900 search warrants for 700 people suspected of hiding a total of 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- from tax authorities . officials said friday they were investigating hundreds of cases of tax evasion , including key figures , via banks in the tiny principality wedged between austria and switzerland . der spiegel reported that investigators paid 5 millions of euros -lrb- 7.3 million -rrb- for secret bank data from liechtenstein enabling them to launch the monster tax evasion probe .
the money was reportedly supplied by german intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- and paid to an informer in 2006 . in the end , the money was deposited in an account in exchange for data identifying those behind the tax fraud in germany but also including secret instructions from liechtenstein on how to hide the flow of money . suspects at high end of income scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank said it would start warning customers liechtenstein 's lgt bank group , which was named in press reports as a focus of the probes , said saturday that it appeared the german authorities were working from client information stolen in 2002 . spokesman hans-martin uehlinger said the list would contain " several hundred names , " adding , " we are going to warn all our clients who are on this list . " the bank thought that all the material had been returned but realized in 2007 that client data might have been " passed on illegally to third parties . " a finance ministry spokesman on friday declined to comment on precisely who was under investigation , saying only that they were " known and unknown , especially people whose revenues are at the high end of the scale . " the sueddeutsche zeitung reported , however , that no other board members of firms listed in the dax , germany 's leading share index , were targeted . the affair erupted after a prosecutor in the western city of bochum announced that deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel was suspected of involvement in a case of tax fraud .

the salmon 's supplier , marine harvest , said it believed the fish had been contaminated by leaked diesel from a boat that take catches for processing .
the fish went to supermarkets including the " big four " of tesco , sainsbury 's , asda and morrisons .
the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- said the salmon may taste unpleasant , but is very unlikely to pose a risk to health .
' precautionary measure ' the fish , some of which was processed by a second firm , young 's seafood , also went to booths , budgens , co-op , nisa-today , shoprite and somerfield .
there is no risk to health whatsoever from inadvertently eating affected products sainsbury 's list of withdrawn products the affected use-by dates are between 7 and 28 february .
sainsbury 's , which has recalled 18 of its products , said : " due to a potential taint in some salmon products from one of our suppliers , as a precautionary measure we have removed from sale a number of lines because the taint affects the taste .
" sainsbury 's is committed to the highest standards and we can reassure our customers that there is no risk to health whatsoever from inadvertently eating affected products . "
in a statement marine harvest said it wanted to apologise to customers and reassure them of its quality assurance procedures .
' unpleasant taste ' the firm said : " some batches of salmon from marine harvest scotland , harvested in early february , have a risk of a petroleum taint causing an unpleasant taste .
" the taint is caused by presence of substances grouped as ' aromatic hydrocarbons ' which are substances normally present in paint , thinners and petroleum-based fuels . "
the company said it believed the taint had come from diesel from a well boat , and said that the boat had been suspended from use pending an inquiry .
it added it was working closely with its customers and government agencies to deal with the problem .
morrisons was the first supermarket to raise the alarm with marine harvest earlier this week .
it contacted the supplier after complaints from around 50 customers led the chain to recall almost 30 scottish salmon products .

the widespread use of automatic number plate recognition systems helped police seize nearly twice as many uninsured vehicles last year , compared to 2006 .
but criminals are managing to stay one step ahead of the law - by using foreign number plates instead .
the aa is now calling for better checks on foreign registered vehicles .
fewer uninsured drivers police figures gathered by the aa show that 150,000 uninsured vehicles were seized last year compared to 78,000 in 2006 .
aa president edmund king said the rise was not necessarily because there were more uninsured drivers on uk roads .
" rather , we think it is because there is now the widespread use of automatic number plate recognition -lrb- anpr -rrb- systems , " he said .
his contention is backed by police figures on the number of claims made for accidents with uninsured drivers .
they have fallen : down from 36,340 in 2006 to 34,239 in 2007 .
we have anecdotal evidence that many european drivers are failing to register their cars in the uk aa president edmund king the government gave police more powers to use anpr technology in 2006 , as well as changing the rules to allow them to seize uninsured vehicles .
anpr cameras are now fitted as standard in many police patrol vehicles .
connected to a database of insured vehicles , the device automatically scans the road ahead and alerts officers to uninsured vehicles , or those fitted with false uk plates .
mr king said : " it used to be that some uninsured motorists driving top-of-the-range cars like mercedes or bmws felt they were less likely to be stopped .
" this may have been true a few years ago - but now they are finding that the camera does not discriminate . "
foreign plates but the aa is warning that uninsured drivers - and those seeking to avoid speeding fines and congestion charges - are turning to a new ruse : foreign number plates .
because foreign plates are not included in databases accessed by the police , they are not automatically picked up by anpr cameras .
the aa says that because there is no record of foreign-registered vehicles going in and out of british ports of entry , it is impossible for police to check which cars are genuinely from outside the uk .
the aa is also concerned that many foreign drivers are flouting the rules that state that they must register their vehicles and fit uk number plates within six months of arriving in britain .
" we have anecdotal evidence that many european drivers are failing to register their cars in the uk .
when they are stopped by the police they claim they have just arrived in the country , " said mr king .
hit and run he called on the government to install anpr cameras at ports and at the channel tunnel .
" that way the police will know which vehicles have come in , and also which vehicles have left the country " it will enable them to catch uk drivers using false foreign plates , as well as catching foreign drivers who are trying to leave the country after committing a hit-and-run offence . "
a spokesman for the department of transport said that while its rules placed an obligation on foreign drivers to register their vehicle after a certain length of time , enforcement of the rule was up to the home office and the police .
a home office spokesman said that any move to install anpr technology at ports of entry would be a " police operational matter " .

fewer uninsured drivers police figures gathered by the aa show that 150,000 uninsured vehicles were seized last year compared to 78,000 in 2006 .
aa president edmund king said the rise was not necessarily because there were more uninsured drivers on uk roads .
" rather , we think it is because there is now the widespread use of automatic number plate recognition -lrb- anpr -rrb- systems , " he said .
his contention is backed by police figures on the number of claims made for accidents with uninsured drivers .

we have anecdotal evidence that many european drivers are failing to register their cars in the uk aa president edmund king the government gave police more powers to use anpr technology in 2006 , as well as changing the rules to allow them to seize uninsured vehicles .
anpr cameras are now fitted as standard in many police patrol vehicles .
connected to a database of insured vehicles , the device automatically scans the road ahead and alerts officers to uninsured vehicles , or those fitted with false uk plates .
mr king said : " it used to be that some uninsured motorists driving top-of-the-range cars like mercedes or bmws felt they were less likely to be stopped .
" this may have been true a few years ago - but now they are finding that the camera does not discriminate . "
foreign plates but the aa is warning that uninsured drivers - and those seeking to avoid speeding fines and congestion charges - are turning to a new ruse : foreign number plates .
because foreign plates are not included in databases accessed by the police , they are not automatically picked up by anpr cameras .
the aa says that because there is no record of foreign-registered vehicles going in and out of british ports of entry , it is impossible for police to check which cars are genuinely from outside the uk .
the aa is also concerned that many foreign drivers are flouting the rules that state that they must register their vehicles and fit uk number plates within six months of arriving in britain .
" we have anecdotal evidence that many european drivers are failing to register their cars in the uk .
when they are stopped by the police they claim they have just arrived in the country , " said mr king .
hit and run he called on the government to install anpr cameras at ports and at the channel tunnel .
" that way the police will know which vehicles have come in , and also which vehicles have left the country " it will enable them to catch uk drivers using false foreign plates , as well as catching foreign drivers who are trying to leave the country after committing a hit-and-run offence . "
a spokesman for the department of transport said that while its rules placed an obligation on foreign drivers to register their vehicle after a certain length of time , enforcement of the rule was up to the home office and the police .
a home office spokesman said that any move to install anpr technology at ports of entry would be a " police operational matter " .

the widespread use of automatic number plate recognition systems helped police seize nearly twice as many uninsured vehicles last year , compared to 2006 .
but criminals are managing to stay one step ahead of the law - by using foreign number plates instead .
the aa is now calling for better checks on foreign registered vehicles .
fewer uninsured drivers police figures gathered by the aa show that 150,000 uninsured vehicles were seized last year compared to 78,000 in 2006 .
aa president edmund king said the rise was not necessarily because there were more uninsured drivers on uk roads .

women are invited to speak at the " public trial " about their experiences of sexual violence .
but the event is designed to highlight the low conviction rate for rape .
in the 30 years that war have been campaigning , there have been changes in the way both the victim and the crime of rape itself is treated .
for instance , in 1991 , rape within marriage became a crime .
the 2003 sexual offences act clarified the law , giving consent a legal definition in england and wales .
with the help of war , in 1995 two women who worked as prostitutes won a private prosecution against a serial rapist after the crown prosecution service refused to prosecute the case .
the rapist was sentenced to 11 years .
and the police have been given new measures .
assistant commissioner john yates , from the metropolitan police , says he believes the police are tackling rape . "
we want to see the procedures and practices that have been agreed to being properly implemented " lisa longstaff , war mock rape trial planned " we constantly are training our forensics and some really innovative work around those issues which says we 've got the best chance possible .
" we 've got more work to do across the country to raise standards and keep that focus on this dreadful crime . "
there are 19 sexual referral centres in england and wales , with 17 more promised , that provide specialised help and support to victims .
project sapphire , set up in 2000 , operates in london boroughs to investigate sexual crimes and support victims .
gap or chasm ?
despite all this , the conviction rate is appallingly low .
there were 820 convictions recorded for rape in 2005/6 , up from 618 in 1997 .
it means only 5.7 % of reported rapes end in a conviction .
why ?
in 2005 , a home office report a gap or a chasm ? highlighted some campaigners ' concerns : there was an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors " which feeds into a culture of scepticism " .
rape and sexual assault the majority of perpetrators are known to the victim 97 % of callers to rape crisis lines knew their assailant prior to the assault during 2001 it is estimated there were 190,000 incidents of serious sexual assault and 47,000 female victims of rape / attempted rape home office figures show that police recorded 12,630 female rapes in 2006-7 data from children and women abuse studies unit and home office it stated : " the criminal justice system needs to shift from a focus on the discreditability of complainants to enhanced evidence gathering and case-building . "
as war holds its " public trial " , the group has written an open letter to the solicitor-general , vera baird , saying that it believes too little is being done to prosecute rapists .
" the blame does not lie with juries but with professionals not doing their jobs , " the letter states .
" we want to see the procedures and practices that have been agreed to being properly implemented , " says lisa longstaff , from war . "
we are determined that all parts of the criminal justice system work together to ensure that the cases that come before the courts are as strong as possible and are prosecuted as strongly as possible " vera baird , solicitor-general " there have been these changes , more and more women reporting crimes , but when they go to authorities to get protection and justice , the people responsible are not doing their job properly . "
the group is calling on the heads of organisations to make sure workers within the system are " called to account " .
it says it has received complaints from women who have been let down by the very specialists who should be working to help them .
it says cctv and phone evidence is not being collected , witnesses not spoken to .
" if the basic evidence is not there and the work is not done by the barrister - you are not going to get a conviction , " ms longstaff explains .
and the group accuses prosecutors of turning down cases on the " flimsiest excuse " and that " sexism appears to be institutionalised in the criminal justice system " .
' strong as possible ' the government agrees the conviction rate is unacceptable .
but it says it is taking steps : specialist rape prosecutors are in place and specialist training provided to police , prosecutors and barristers , for instance .
new measures , following a consultation carried out in 2006 , including the right for juries to hear the psychological reactions of rape victims have been proposed .
the director of public prosecutions , ken macdonald , says he realises too many cases have been rejected too early , and has made it a priority to tackle the low rate of rape prosecutions .
solicitor-general vera baird points to the way the government has changed the law on rape , adding that there is commitment to the police and cps working together to build better cases .
she cites the sexual offences act 2003 , saying that more relevant evidence can be heard by the jury and that there are tougher sentences for those convicted .
she says : " we are determined that all parts of the criminal justice system work together to ensure that the cases that come before the courts are as strong as possible and are prosecuted as strongly as possible . "

women are invited to speak at the " public trial " about their experiences of sexual violence .
but the event is designed to highlight the low conviction rate for rape .
in the 30 years that war have been campaigning , there have been changes in the way both the victim and the crime of rape itself is treated .
for instance , in 1991 , rape within marriage became a crime .
the 2003 sexual offences act clarified the law , giving consent a legal definition in england and wales .
with the help of war , in 1995 two women who worked as prostitutes won a private prosecution against a serial rapist after the crown prosecution service refused to prosecute the case .
the rapist was sentenced to 11 years .
and the police have been given new measures .
assistant commissioner john yates , from the metropolitan police , says he believes the police are tackling rape .
we want to see the procedures and practices that have been agreed to being properly implemented lisa longstaff , war mock rape trial planned " we constantly are training our forensics and some really innovative work around those issues which says we 've got the best chance possible .

despite all this , the conviction rate is appallingly low .
there were 820 convictions recorded for rape in 2005/6 , up from 618 in 1997 .
it means only 5.7 % of reported rapes end in a conviction .
why ?
in 2005 , a home office report a gap or a chasm ? highlighted some campaigners ' concerns : there was an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors " which feeds into a culture of scepticism " .
rape and sexual assault the majority of perpetrators are known to the victim 97 % of callers to rape crisis lines knew their assailant prior to the assault during 2001 it is estimated there were 190,000 incidents of serious sexual assault and 47,000 female victims of rape / attempted rape home office figures show that police recorded 12,630 female rapes in 2006-7 data from children and women abuse studies unit and home office it stated : " the criminal justice system needs to shift from a focus on the discreditability of complainants to enhanced evidence gathering and case-building .

as war holds its " public trial " , the group has written an open letter to the solicitor-general , vera baird , saying that it believes too little is being done to prosecute rapists .
" the blame does not lie with juries but with professionals not doing their jobs , " the letter states .
" we want to see the procedures and practices that have been agreed to being properly implemented , " says lisa longstaff , from war .

it says it has received complaints from women who have been let down by the very specialists who should be working to help them .

the united states and many european union countries accept that kosovo should no longer be formally part of serbia .
they will recognise a limited form of independence for kosovo , as recommended in a report drawn up for the un by the former finnish president martti ahtisaari .
the eu is sending a major law and order mission to kosovo , made up of 1,800 police and justice officials , including judges , in effect taking over from the current un presence .
serbia itself , supported strongly by russia , rejects independence for kosovo .
serbia and russia argue that there is no un security council approval for the move and that the parties should continue negotiating until an agreement is reached .
serbia offered kosovo autonomy but not independence .
so what are the legal arguments for and against recognition ?
the arguments for after the war over kosovo in 1999 , the un security council took control .
in resolution 1244 of 10 june 1999 , it ordered the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- as it then was -rrb- to withdraw all its forces from kosovo and hand kosovo over to the un .
the problem is that although the resolution called for a " political solution to the kosovo crisis " , it did not specify what that solution should be .
acting to implement the final status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome eu document and there has not been any further security council resolution mandating independence for kosovo .
many western governments argue that because 1244 does refer to general principles that g8 foreign ministers had agreed in advance of the resolution , these should be used as the basis for the acceptance of independence now .
these principles include the deployment in kosovo of " international civil and security presences " and " facilitating a political process designed to determine kosovo 's future status " .
eu legal opinion the european union has drawn up , as it is required to do by eu procedures , a document to justify its own mission to kosovo and the arguments deployed are the same as the ones used to justify recognition .
the city of mitrovica is a symbol of the serb-albanian divide the document basically argues that independence for kosovo is within the spirit of 1244 , if not strictly within the letter .
the 1244 resolution also envisaged a final status process and did not constrain or pre-determine its outcome .
" acting to implement the final status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome in a situation where everyone agrees that the status quo is unsustainable , " it says .
the document adds that this approach " will enable , rather than frustrate , the conclusion of the final status process envisaged in resolution 1244 " .
and it gives approval to international recognition : " generally , once a entity has emerged as a state in the sense of international law , a political decision can be taken to recognise it . "
we are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law sergei lavrov , russian foreign minister un plans to tackle limbo nato troops under the kosovo force -lrb- k-for -rrb- continue to be mandated by 1244 , the opinion holds .
as for the legality of the eu mission , the argument is that there is nothing to stop the eu from taking over from the un , as 1244 simply refers to " international civil and security presences " .
in addition , it suggests that kosovo could invite the eu to undertake this role .
the document interprets references in the 1244 preamble to kosovo being part of the federal republic of yugoslavia and to the " territorial integrity " of yugoslavia as being non-binding .
the arguments against the counter-argument by serbia and russia is simpler .
it is that serbia , the sovereign state , has not agreed to independence for kosovo , that there is no security council resolution authorising the detachment of kosovo from serbia and that therefore its independence is illegal .
some european union members - greece , spain , cyprus , slovakia , bulgaria and romania - agree , though they have not blocked the eu mission .
serbia remains strongly opposed to independence serbia and russia also say that 1244 itself gives no authority for independence .
they point to article 10 of 1244 which authorises " substantial autonomy with the federal republic of yugoslavia " for kosovo , meaning , in their view , that 1244 blocks independence .
and they argue that 1244 talks about international organisations being deployed in kosovo " under united nations auspices " , which an eu mission would lack .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had this to say on 12 february , in a translation by the ria novosti news agency in moscow : " we are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law , about the subversion of those principles which , at huge effort , and at the cost of europe 's pain , sacrifice and bloodletting have been earned and laid down as a basis of its existence .
" we are speaking about a subversion of those principles on which the organisation for security and co-operation in europe rests , those -lsb- principles -rsb- laid down in the fundamental documents of the un . "
the main principle he refers to is that borders should be changed only by agreement .
in russia and serbia 's view , since there is no agreement , there should be no recognition .

it is that serbia , the sovereign state , has not agreed to independence for kosovo , that there is no security council resolution authorising the detachment of kosovo from serbia and that therefore its independence is illegal .
some european union members - greece , spain , cyprus , slovakia , bulgaria and romania - agree , though they have not blocked the eu mission .
serbia remains strongly opposed to independence serbia and russia also say that 1244 itself gives no authority for independence .
they point to article 10 of 1244 which authorises " substantial autonomy with the federal republic of yugoslavia " for kosovo , meaning , in their view , that 1244 blocks independence .
and they argue that 1244 talks about international organisations being deployed in kosovo " under united nations auspices " , which an eu mission would lack .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had this to say on 12 february , in a translation by the ria novosti news agency in moscow : " we are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law , about the subversion of those principles which , at huge effort , and at the cost of europe 's pain , sacrifice and bloodletting have been earned and laid down as a basis of its existence .

the united states and many european union countries accept that kosovo should no longer be formally part of serbia .
they will recognise a limited form of independence for kosovo , as recommended in a report drawn up for the un by the former finnish president martti ahtisaari .
the eu is sending a major law and order mission to kosovo , made up of 1,800 police and justice officials , including judges , in effect taking over from the current un presence .
serbia itself , supported strongly by russia , rejects independence for kosovo .
serbia and russia argue that there is no un security council approval for the move and that the parties should continue negotiating until an agreement is reached .
serbia offered kosovo autonomy but not independence .
so what are the legal arguments for and against recognition ?
the arguments for after the war over kosovo in 1999 , the un security council took control .
in resolution 1244 of 10 june 1999 , it ordered the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- as it then was -rrb- to withdraw all its forces from kosovo and hand kosovo over to the un .
the problem is that although the resolution called for a " political solution to the kosovo crisis " , it did not specify what that solution should be .
acting to implement the final status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome eu document and there has not been any further security council resolution mandating independence for kosovo .
many western governments argue that because 1244 does refer to general principles that g8 foreign ministers had agreed in advance of the resolution , these should be used as the basis for the acceptance of independence now .
these principles include the deployment in kosovo of " international civil and security presences " and " facilitating a political process designed to determine kosovo 's future status " .
eu legal opinion the european union has drawn up , as it is required to do by eu procedures , a document to justify its own mission to kosovo and the arguments deployed are the same as the ones used to justify recognition .
the city of mitrovica is a symbol of the serb-albanian divide the document basically argues that independence for kosovo is within the spirit of 1244 , if not strictly within the letter .
the 1244 resolution also envisaged a final status process and did not constrain or pre-determine its outcome .
" acting to implement the final status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome in a situation where everyone agrees that the status quo is unsustainable , " it says .
the document adds that this approach " will enable , rather than frustrate , the conclusion of the final status process envisaged in resolution 1244 " .
and it gives approval to international recognition : " generally , once a entity has emerged as a state in the sense of international law , a political decision can be taken to recognise it . "
we are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law sergei lavrov , russian foreign minister un plans to tackle limbo nato troops under the kosovo force -lrb- k-for -rrb- continue to be mandated by 1244 , the opinion holds .
as for the legality of the eu mission , the argument is that there is nothing to stop the eu from taking over from the un , as 1244 simply refers to " international civil and security presences " .
in addition , it suggests that kosovo could invite the eu to undertake this role .
the document interprets references in the 1244 preamble to kosovo being part of the federal republic of yugoslavia and to the " territorial integrity " of yugoslavia as being non-binding .
