german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .

german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .

it 's bound to steal the limelight from the luxury limousines that will be presented at the detroit motor show next week , dudenhöffer said . european , us contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renault 's dacia logan seems to be doing well french carmaker renault already proved that discount cars can be successful in europe as well : by 2010 , the company wants to sell one million dacia logans , which is produced by the firm 's romanian subsidiary . us carmaker ford also plans to begin building a discount car priced at around 5,000 euros in india in the next couple of years .
ford is currently investing about half a billion dollars in its plant in chennai , where it plans to build 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines per year .
ford also has similar plans for thailand and china . dudenhöffer said he expects fiat , toyota and chinese carmakers such as cherry and geely to join tata , renault and ford in producing for the discount sector . proud germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has no plans to go below its fox model german firms such as volkswagen have turned their backs on the low-end market so far . " maybe that 's because these are not cars that german engineers can be proud , " dudenhöffer said . willi diez , the head of the institute for automotive business -lrb- ifa -rrb- , said that producing discount cars could seriously harm the image of german companies as producers of high-quality cars that are equipped with leading technologies . but the tata nano , for example , performs quite well as far as climate protection is concerned - despite its simple design and rudimentary technology .
it runs on less than four liters -lrb- about one gallon -rrb- per 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- .
its co2 emissions are below eu limits and well below those of german carmakers . shifting markets according to dudenhöffer , some 74.6 million cars will be sold globally by 2020 - half of them in developing countries . " while the established car markets are stagnating , the growth is happening elsewhere , " he said , adding that this will lead to a shift in focus for european carmakers towards asia and eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .

" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.01.2008 green energy booming , but experts warn of cloudy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say investment is falling in germany 's wind energy sector renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption in 2007 , but further progress may be hindered if government support is cut back , according to new statistics . the use of renewable energy reached a record high in 2007 , the german renewable energy federation -lrb- bee -rrb- said on tuesday , jan 8 , as it released new figures on the sector .
renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , they 've lived next to , not with , belgians .
a new integration project is trying to change that . one would think that brussels was a melting pot of social integration and interaction , given its mix of flemish and francophone locals and the large number of international residents tossed in for good measure .
but the international community seems to operate safely within its expat comfort zone while the locals get on with their lives alongside the distant foreigners . the king baudouin foundation , named after the country 's late monarch , is trying to change that .
its brexpat initiative aims to bring expats and local people closer together .
contacts between expats and locals are often limited or non-existent for reasons such has the temporary stay of expats , the language barrier and the financial gap , said brexpat project coordinator nosheen shakil . " we hope to start initiatives that bridge the gap between locals and expats , " shakil said .
" locals will , in this way , discover the extra value of living in the capital of europe and expats will feel less isolated and have the feeling to live in a real country , not on an expat island . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two communities live side-by-side but rarely interact brexpat was launched in march 2007 with a call for organizations in the region to submit applications for funding .
the groups had to have an expat partner and a brussels and could receive up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,200 -rrb- to help cover costs . the brussels celtic rugby club was one of the successful applicants .
the club , formed in 1998 by mostly irish expats and locals with the onus on creating an expat team with a real and tangible belgian element , has grown to embrace members from a total of 25 nationalities in all .
its expansion , however , had put a lot of pressure on its funds . " we have had to make all kinds of new investments and these , of course , cost a lot of money , " club secretary graham edwards said .
" the foundation 's financial support has been of enormous importance in helping us invest in the materials needed for a rugby club . " integration vital to city 's social fabric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports , including rugby , promote understanding edwards believes that team sports of any type , but especially rugby , are hugely effective at promoting understanding between different nationalities and cultures . " we strongly believe that our unique and very sociable identity and atmosphere is proof of the success of our founding concept and is the reason for our ever increasing success , " he said .
edwards also believes that communication between the expat community and locals in brussels and the surrounding areas is hugely important in maintaining the fabric of civil society . " just go to the paris banlieus if you want to see what , in extreme cases , can happen when cultures are not integrated in spite of living together , " he said . sports clubs are not the only organizations to benefit from the foundation 's initiative .
the gallery gabrichidze in brussels has also increased its reach thanks to funding support .
the gallery organizes international exhibitions for the local wallon and flemish communities and expats as well as workshops where the problems of migration , adaptation to belgian life and dealing with local bureaucracy are discussed . aiming to heal a divided nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is currently struggling with lingustic divisions " our aim is to unite the flemish , walloon and expat communities under one roof using creativity as a tool , " said gallery co-founder olena omelchenko .
" thanks to the funding , we are now able to focus on executing our projects without worrying about making profits to cover the losses . " omelchenko believes that , if brussels wants to keep its role as the capital of eu political and social life , then expats and locals should live together in more harmony and integration .
she says such harmony could then be used as a blueprint for the rest of the country .
" if belgium wants to keep itself together , then the walloons and the flemish should also find a way to cope with each other , " she said . " it is important to bring people together and struggle against negative factors which divide them . " while bringing people together is one of the objectives of the initiative , it also aims to promote the different cultures living in brussels .
liene reine , one of the organizers of the riga nights project , explained that foundation funds are helping to finance a cultural exchange between latvian , belgian and expat artists . understanding through cultural exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project promotes shared spaces in the city " our aim is to cover the lack of presence of latvian contemporary culture in brussels , " reine said .
" the riga nights project explores , discovers and establishes the possibilities of cooperation between latvian and belgian artists , while actively involving the expat community .
ideally the next phase would be to bring belgian artists to latvia . " we aim to create more than just a one-way cultural exposition , " she added .
" we want to create common spaces for common interactions and performances which will establish bridges among people with different cultural backgrounds , yet sharing something in common , thus stimulating the cross-cultural communication . " the foundation is currently calling for applications for the second round of funding , which will carry on the aims of improving the integration of expats in brussels and also giving locals a better feeling for the international vocation of their city . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .
10 .
it 's bound to steal the limelight from the luxury limousines that will be presented at the detroit motor show next week , dudenhöffer said . european , us contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renault 's dacia logan seems to be doing well french carmaker renault already proved that discount cars can be successful in europe as well : by 2010 , the company wants to sell one million dacia logans , which is produced by the firm 's romanian subsidiary . us carmaker ford also plans to begin building a discount car priced at around 5,000 euros in india in the next couple of years .
ford is currently investing about half a billion dollars in its plant in chennai , where it plans to build 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines per year .
ford also has similar plans for thailand and china . dudenhöffer said he expects fiat , toyota and chinese carmakers such as cherry and geely to join tata , renault and ford in producing for the discount sector . proud germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has no plans to go below its fox model german firms such as volkswagen have turned their backs on the low-end market so far . " maybe that 's because these are not cars that german engineers can be proud , " dudenhöffer said . willi diez , the head of the institute for automotive business -lrb- ifa -rrb- , said that producing discount cars could seriously harm the image of german companies as producers of high-quality cars that are equipped with leading technologies . but the tata nano , for example , performs quite well as far as climate protection is concerned - despite its simple design and rudimentary technology .
it runs on less than four liters -lrb- about one gallon -rrb- per 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- .
its co2 emissions are below eu limits and well below those of german carmakers . shifting markets according to dudenhöffer , some 74.6 million cars will be sold globally by 2020 - half of them in developing countries . " while the established car markets are stagnating , the growth is happening elsewhere , " he said , adding that this will lead to a shift in focus for european carmakers towards asia and eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .

the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .

missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .

russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 13.01.2008 poland demands us protection as missile shield debate heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned deployment of us missiles on polish soil angers russia and worries poles poland finds itself between a rock and hard place in regards to the planned deployment of us missiles on its territory .
as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .

tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .

" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .

" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gallery organizes international exhibitions for the local wallon and flemish communities and expats as well as workshops where the problems of migration , adaptation to belgian life and dealing with local bureaucracy are discussed . aiming to heal a divided nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is currently struggling with lingustic divisions " our aim is to unite the flemish , walloon and expat communities under one roof using creativity as a tool , " said gallery co-founder olena omelchenko .
" thanks to the funding , we are now able to focus on executing our projects without worrying about making profits to cover the losses . " omelchenko believes that , if brussels wants to keep its role as the capital of eu political and social life , then expats and locals should live together in more harmony and integration .
she says such harmony could then be used as a blueprint for the rest of the country .
" if belgium wants to keep itself together , then the walloons and the flemish should also find a way to cope with each other , " she said . " it is important to bring people together and struggle against negative factors which divide them . " while bringing people together is one of the objectives of the initiative , it also aims to promote the different cultures living in brussels .
liene reine , one of the organizers of the riga nights project , explained that foundation funds are helping to finance a cultural exchange between latvian , belgian and expat artists . understanding through cultural exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project promotes shared spaces in the city " our aim is to cover the lack of presence of latvian contemporary culture in brussels , " reine said .
" the riga nights project explores , discovers and establishes the possibilities of cooperation between latvian and belgian artists , while actively involving the expat community .
ideally the next phase would be to bring belgian artists to latvia . " we aim to create more than just a one-way cultural exposition , " she added .
" we want to create common spaces for common interactions and performances which will establish bridges among people with different cultural backgrounds , yet sharing something in common , thus stimulating the cross-cultural communication . " the foundation is currently calling for applications for the second round of funding , which will carry on the aims of improving the integration of expats in brussels and also giving locals a better feeling for the international vocation of their city . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.

the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .
10 .
it 's bound to steal the limelight from the luxury limousines that will be presented at the detroit motor show next week , dudenhöffer said . european , us contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renault 's dacia logan seems to be doing well french carmaker renault already proved that discount cars can be successful in europe as well : by 2010 , the company wants to sell one million dacia logans , which is produced by the firm 's romanian subsidiary . us carmaker ford also plans to begin building a discount car priced at around 5,000 euros in india in the next couple of years .
ford is currently investing about half a billion dollars in its plant in chennai , where it plans to build 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines per year .
ford also has similar plans for thailand and china . dudenhöffer said he expects fiat , toyota and chinese carmakers such as cherry and geely to join tata , renault and ford in producing for the discount sector . proud germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has no plans to go below its fox model german firms such as volkswagen have turned their backs on the low-end market so far . " maybe that 's because these are not cars that german engineers can be proud , " dudenhöffer said . willi diez , the head of the institute for automotive business -lrb- ifa -rrb- , said that producing discount cars could seriously harm the image of german companies as producers of high-quality cars that are equipped with leading technologies . but the tata nano , for example , performs quite well as far as climate protection is concerned - despite its simple design and rudimentary technology .
it runs on less than four liters -lrb- about one gallon -rrb- per 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- .
its co2 emissions are below eu limits and well below those of german carmakers . shifting markets according to dudenhöffer , some 74.6 million cars will be sold globally by 2020 - half of them in developing countries . " while the established car markets are stagnating , the growth is happening elsewhere , " he said , adding that this will lead to a shift in focus for european carmakers towards asia and eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .
10 .
it 's bound to steal the limelight from the luxury limousines that will be presented at the detroit motor show next week , dudenhöffer said . european , us contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renault 's dacia logan seems to be doing well french carmaker renault already proved that discount cars can be successful in europe as well : by 2010 , the company wants to sell one million dacia logans , which is produced by the firm 's romanian subsidiary . us carmaker ford also plans to begin building a discount car priced at around 5,000 euros in india in the next couple of years .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .

it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .

ford is currently investing about half a billion dollars in its plant in chennai , where it plans to build 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines per year .

it runs on less than four liters -lrb- about one gallon -rrb- per 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- .
its co2 emissions are below eu limits and well below those of german carmakers . shifting markets according to dudenhöffer , some 74.6 million cars will be sold globally by 2020 - half of them in developing countries .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.01.2008 green energy booming , but experts warn of cloudy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say investment is falling in germany 's wind energy sector renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption in 2007 , but further progress may be hindered if government support is cut back , according to new statistics . the use of renewable energy reached a record high in 2007 , the german renewable energy federation -lrb- bee -rrb- said on tuesday , jan 8 , as it released new figures on the sector .
renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.01.2008 germany launches new drive to tackle skills crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apprenticeship is a crucial route into the german job market for many to plug a long-standing need for skilled workers and reverse the large number of school drop-outs , the german government plans to offer financial incentives to companies that hire extra trainees . the german cabinet agreed this week to help around 100,000 youth , who had applied in vain for an apprenticeship and now face a bleak future , by offering incentives to companies to hire them .
german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "
companies would be forced to accept poorly qualified youth that would end up lowering the standards of apprenticeships . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years . " none of these environment protection goals can be reached if germany does n't expand its renewable energy sector , " said uphoff . clean energy cuts import reliance the bee wants more money for renewable energy providers feeding into the electricity grid as well as a roll-back of the biofuel tax increase . it argues that the use of renewable energy saved the country the equivalent of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- in costs for environmental damages last year . it pointed out that renewable energy - worth 6 billion euros last year - also reduced germany 's reliance on imports of oil , gas , coal and uranium last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .

the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .

india is at the forefront , but german producers hold their own . according to a study by german car expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , some 3.5 million cars priced at 1,360 euros 3,400 euros will be sold each year .
german carmakers , however , are far from being prepared for the demand , which is expected to come mainly from developing countries . the tata nano , the world 's cheapest car at 1,700 euros , was just unveiled in new delhi on thursday , jan .
10 .
it 's bound to steal the limelight from the luxury limousines that will be presented at the detroit motor show next week , dudenhöffer said . european , us contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renault 's dacia logan seems to be doing well french carmaker renault already proved that discount cars can be successful in europe as well : by 2010 , the company wants to sell one million dacia logans , which is produced by the firm 's romanian subsidiary . us carmaker ford also plans to begin building a discount car priced at around 5,000 euros in india in the next couple of years .
ford is currently investing about half a billion dollars in its plant in chennai , where it plans to build 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines per year .
ford also has similar plans for thailand and china . dudenhöffer said he expects fiat , toyota and chinese carmakers such as cherry and geely to join tata , renault and ford in producing for the discount sector . proud germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has no plans to go below its fox model german firms such as volkswagen have turned their backs on the low-end market so far . " maybe that 's because these are not cars that german engineers can be proud , " dudenhöffer said . willi diez , the head of the institute for automotive business -lrb- ifa -rrb- , said that producing discount cars could seriously harm the image of german companies as producers of high-quality cars that are equipped with leading technologies . but the tata nano , for example , performs quite well as far as climate protection is concerned - despite its simple design and rudimentary technology .
it runs on less than four liters -lrb- about one gallon -rrb- per 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- .
its co2 emissions are below eu limits and well below those of german carmakers . shifting markets according to dudenhöffer , some 74.6 million cars will be sold globally by 2020 - half of them in developing countries . " while the established car markets are stagnating , the growth is happening elsewhere , " he said , adding that this will lead to a shift in focus for european carmakers towards asia and eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .
that 's equivalent to co2 emissions emitted in one year by a city the size of cologne , which has around a million inhabitants . " in no other nation has the development of renewable energy been as rapid as in germany , " the bee said . government cut-backs could hamper growth while the rise of renewable energy was stronger in germany than anywhere else in the world , the association warned that government plans to cut support for the industry may hobble further growth . though wind energy played the biggest role in electricity consumption in germany last year ; largely due to strong winds , experts say investment is actually falling in the sector resulting in fewer wind parks being built . " the cost of building wind turbines has risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past few years due to spiraling prices of steel and copper , " harald uphoff , head of bee 's berlin office , told dw-world.de.
" at the same time , government support has been sinking . " uphoff said state aid for renewable was higher in countries such as spain , britain and the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world market leader in solar energy germany 's fast-growing renewable energy sector - employing some 250,000 people - is often criticized for relying too heavily on government support . the sector dates back to a landmark renewable energy law passed in 2000 .
the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .
the law also set up fixed rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid . important tool to protect environment with provisions in the law set to be gradually lowered over the next years , energy experts say investments in the sector are falling .
a new tax hike on biofuels , which took effect last year , has worsened the situation by leading to stagnation in the sector and squeezing mid-size renewable energy companies . " the new tax rise on biofuels has threatened the existence of smaller companies , " said johannes lackmann , bbe president .
" the government 's pronouncements are n't enough to boost renewable energy . " the german government wants to raise the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption to 25 percent to 30 percent by 2020 in order to meet european union targets of reducing co2 emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tax hike on biofuels has been criticized by environmental groups in april this year , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel proposed further ambitious goals which involve slashing germany 's carbon emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .

renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption , up from almost 12 percent in 2006 with wind playing the biggest role . energy drawn from wind , solar , water , biomass and thermal heat accounted for 9 percent of germany 's total primary energy consumption last year , reducing the country 's greenhouse gas emissions by 115 million tons , the association said .

the legislation , which committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 , sets specific tariffs for each renewable energy technology based on its real cost . it guarantees that , for a limited time , the nation 's electric utilities must buy all wind , solar and other renewable power at a price per kilowatt-hour higher than that of power generated from coal , nuclear or natural gas .

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .
not only could the oil seep into the porous ice cap , but the cold water contains fewer microorganisms to decompose the dangerous liquid . competitors will have to talk in the end , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf will decide which countries will be allowed to explore the ocean floor in the arctic .
the applicants will have to submit evidence claiming their right to it by 2014 . the five states wo n't get around negotiations on the matter , said maritime law expert alexander proelß from the university of kiel , since the un commission does n't have the power to decide what should happen in case the territories overlap . some experts have predicted a scenario reminiscent of the cold war if the race for arctic access escalates . proelß , however , said that 's unlikely as the arctic treasure hunt will be tempered not only by the states ' own commitment to cooperation but also by existing bodies like the un continental shelf commission and the arctic council . jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while environmentalists worry about how quickly the north pole is melting away , russia , canada , denmark , norway and the us are waiting for just that . the thinner the ice gets , the sooner the treasures that lie beneath is can be unearthed . researchers believe there to be some 10 billion tons of oil and gas in the so-called lomonosov ridge , an underwater mountain range that stretches from greenland to eastern siberia - precisely underneath the north pole . us scientists even presume that a quarter of the global crude oil and natural gas reserves lie beneath the arctic ice .
however , rudolf kudrass from the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources -lrb- bgr -rrb- in hanover says it 's not likely that larger amounts of these natural resources are to be found more than 200 nautical miles away from russia , canada and the us . scuffle over the ocean floor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia claimed the north pole territory in august by planting a flag on the ocean floor nevertheless , it is precisely the area beyond this mark - which , according to un maritime law is also the boundary for conducting research , fishing and claiming natural resources - that has peaked the interest of the five north pole rivals . there 's just one catch : an exception can be made to the un law if it can be proven that stone formations beyond the 200-nautical-mile border are part of a country 's own continental shelf . russia , which sent a submarine to the north pole last summer and rammed a russian flag into the ocean floor , but also canada and denmark are looking for evidence . the only way to prove a connection between the ridge and a neighboring continental shelf is by drilling and comparing bedrock , which can be very expensive in the arctic , said kudrass . drilling for proof the integrated ocean drilling program , an international initiative , has already bored four times into the ridge - at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17.7 million -rrb- .
since the drill had a maximum depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 1,300 feet -rrb- and could only collect sediment , it 's still inconclusive as to who has claim to the ridge and the treasures it holds . " the water there is around 4,000 meters deep so , technically speaking , it 's new territory , " said christian reichert , also from bgr .
the energy prices would have to be extremely high for it to be worth investing there , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icy conditions make research difficult at the north pole what 's more , drilling for oil or gas under the north pole would have to be done under strict conditions as an oil spill at such low temperatures could have serious consequences for the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 13.01.2008 poland demands us protection as missile shield debate heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned deployment of us missiles on polish soil angers russia and worries poles poland finds itself between a rock and hard place in regards to the planned deployment of us missiles on its territory .
as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .
" it knows perfectly well it ca n't stop the missile shield just as it could not prevent the -lrb- 1999 -rrb- expansion of nato to its doorstep , " he said .
" russia also shares a fundamental security concern with the west - both are worried about iran developing an offensive nuclear capability . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had more than 76,000 school drop-outs in 2005 schavan added that a further goal of the initiative was to boost education opportunities , fulfill demands for skilled labor as germany 's population ages and cut the number of school drop-outs .
according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .
others however pointed out that the planned incentive for companies " is not acceptable in this form . "

german education minister annette schavan said companies who offered extra apprenticeships for such young people could get as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,825 -rrb- .
the measure is part of an initiative called " rising up through education " for which berlin has earmarked around 500 million euros until 2010 .
according to statistics , the number of young graduates who had failed to find an apprenticeship has risen to over 300,000 .
schavan pointed out the goal was to offer these young people " a second chance " and a professional future .
tackling a skills crunch germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .

according to the federal statistics office , some 76,000 youth in germany dropped out of school in 2005 without completing it .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
mixed reaction the latest measure has sparked a mixed reaction among top business groups and industry associations .
" the planned bonuses will come into effect in an area where there are problems : the training of youths who have a tough time on the job market either because of their poor abilities at school or limited social skills , " said volker giersch , head of the ihk .

as a result , the poles want assurances that they will be protected , whatever their decision . poland cranked up the diplomatic heat on washington saturday when defense minister bogdan klich called for a special military treaty ahead of negotiations on a us missile shield in europe .
demanding the same agreements and protection afforded the likes of italy and turkey , klich suggested that the united states owed poland for the support and concessions it had made over the years .
" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .
" the reaction by the united states to our expectations will be a sort of test to see if washington really considers poland as its partner in central europe , " klich told the newspaper .
at the moment , he added , the united states treats poland like " a distant cousin . "
tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister tusk , left , with mirek topolanek tusk said last week that poland and the czech republic were in no rush to conclude negotiations with washington .
" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .
after meeting with russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak , sikorski said that the discussions were of a " matter-of-fact " nature .
" i came away with the impression that our neighbor is happy that we are finally talking , " he added , " but fundamental differences in views remain .
missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .
other missile shield opponents contend the project just wo n't fly as it relies on unworkable technology and is simply too expensive given there is no credible threat to justify it .
russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .

" special military agreements link the united states with certain allies like italy or turkey , " klich told with the dziennik daily , in an interview ahead of talks in washington tuesday .
" the signature of such an accord with poland seems justified in our view given services rendered to the americans over recent years .

tusk demands us security guarantees the defense minister 's remarks follow those of prime minister donald tusk who recently linked an agreement with the us on an anti-missile system with enforcing polish security .
tusk has made it clear he wants extra us security guarantees , possibly in the form of a patriot missile air defense system similar to one already deployed in neighboring nato-member germany .
the us wants to install 10 interceptor missile sites in poland by 2012 to ward off potential attacks by so-called rogue states , notably iran .
the plan also calls for associated radar stations in the czech republic .

" it is not a race against time .
the essential thing is to get what we want from the negotiation , for the polish as well as the czech sides , " tusk told a joint news conference with his czech counterpart , mirek topolanek .
the missile plan has raised a number of concerns in poland .
surveys show a majority of poles worry the shield could make their country more of a target for terrorists .
poland fears being left with nothing but fall-out there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
" the worst scenario is a situation in which poland would agree to the shield , will incur the political costs and then the base is not built , because of a change of government in the united states , " poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said recently .
poland 's regional agenda also casts a shadow over tuesday 's talks in washington , with tusk due in moscow next month .
poland 's ruling liberals are keen to prevent the us plan from compromising their push to mend tattered ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski could not hide the fact that russia was displeased sikorski held talks with his russian counterparts recently and revealed that the two countries still faced " fundamental differences " over the us missile shield plan .

missile shield signals major shift in defense strategy the topic of the us missile shield in europe has generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes .
" the adoption of missile defense in poland would imply a significant shift in western strategic thinking , " benjamin schreer , an analyst at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mixture of offense and defense " with new terrorist threats and particularly the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and nuclear weapons , the west 's offense-based security and deterrence strategy is no longer sufficient - a new mix including offensive and defensive elements is necessary , " he said .
british expert tim williams agreed the shield would be a major departure from current " offensive " policy and said missile defense in eastern europe was clearly seen as " the way to go " in an era of shadowy nuclear proliferation .
" it moves from the current practice of deterrence with offensive weapons to deterrence by defense and denial - denying your enemy the ability to strike , " williams , from the royal united services institute , told afp .
" it could be the first step in a new global security architecture , " he added .
expert believes shield could reduce nuclear threat schreer went even further , suggesting that a shift to missile defense systems from purely offensive capabilities could " reduce the west 's reliance on nuclear weapons as a primary means of deterrence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia can protest but not stop the missile shield critics say the project could provoke a new arms race and point to russian president vladimir putin 's recent decision to suspend participation in the cfe , a cold war-era treaty that set limits on troops and weapons .

russia 's opposition can not stop shield while washington continues its negotiations with prague and warsaw , it is also attempting to win over moscow - so far with little success .
schreer forecasts that moscow 's objections would not prove decisive to the project 's future .

so far , they 've lived next to , not with , belgians .
a new integration project is trying to change that . one would think that brussels was a melting pot of social integration and interaction , given its mix of flemish and francophone locals and the large number of international residents tossed in for good measure .
but the international community seems to operate safely within its expat comfort zone while the locals get on with their lives alongside the distant foreigners . the king baudouin foundation , named after the country 's late monarch , is trying to change that .
its brexpat initiative aims to bring expats and local people closer together .
contacts between expats and locals are often limited or non-existent for reasons such has the temporary stay of expats , the language barrier and the financial gap , said brexpat project coordinator nosheen shakil . " we hope to start initiatives that bridge the gap between locals and expats , " shakil said .
" locals will , in this way , discover the extra value of living in the capital of europe and expats will feel less isolated and have the feeling to live in a real country , not on an expat island . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two communities live side-by-side but rarely interact brexpat was launched in march 2007 with a call for organizations in the region to submit applications for funding .
the groups had to have an expat partner and a brussels and could receive up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,200 -rrb- to help cover costs . the brussels celtic rugby club was one of the successful applicants .
the club , formed in 1998 by mostly irish expats and locals with the onus on creating an expat team with a real and tangible belgian element , has grown to embrace members from a total of 25 nationalities in all .
its expansion , however , had put a lot of pressure on its funds . " we have had to make all kinds of new investments and these , of course , cost a lot of money , " club secretary graham edwards said .
" the foundation 's financial support has been of enormous importance in helping us invest in the materials needed for a rugby club . " integration vital to city 's social fabric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports , including rugby , promote understanding edwards believes that team sports of any type , but especially rugby , are hugely effective at promoting understanding between different nationalities and cultures . " we strongly believe that our unique and very sociable identity and atmosphere is proof of the success of our founding concept and is the reason for our ever increasing success , " he said .
edwards also believes that communication between the expat community and locals in brussels and the surrounding areas is hugely important in maintaining the fabric of civil society . " just go to the paris banlieus if you want to see what , in extreme cases , can happen when cultures are not integrated in spite of living together , " he said . sports clubs are not the only organizations to benefit from the foundation 's initiative .
the gallery gabrichidze in brussels has also increased its reach thanks to funding support .
the gallery organizes international exhibitions for the local wallon and flemish communities and expats as well as workshops where the problems of migration , adaptation to belgian life and dealing with local bureaucracy are discussed . aiming to heal a divided nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is currently struggling with lingustic divisions " our aim is to unite the flemish , walloon and expat communities under one roof using creativity as a tool , " said gallery co-founder olena omelchenko .
" thanks to the funding , we are now able to focus on executing our projects without worrying about making profits to cover the losses . " omelchenko believes that , if brussels wants to keep its role as the capital of eu political and social life , then expats and locals should live together in more harmony and integration .
she says such harmony could then be used as a blueprint for the rest of the country .
" if belgium wants to keep itself together , then the walloons and the flemish should also find a way to cope with each other , " she said . " it is important to bring people together and struggle against negative factors which divide them . " while bringing people together is one of the objectives of the initiative , it also aims to promote the different cultures living in brussels .
liene reine , one of the organizers of the riga nights project , explained that foundation funds are helping to finance a cultural exchange between latvian , belgian and expat artists . understanding through cultural exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project promotes shared spaces in the city " our aim is to cover the lack of presence of latvian contemporary culture in brussels , " reine said .
" the riga nights project explores , discovers and establishes the possibilities of cooperation between latvian and belgian artists , while actively involving the expat community .
ideally the next phase would be to bring belgian artists to latvia . " we aim to create more than just a one-way cultural exposition , " she added .
" we want to create common spaces for common interactions and performances which will establish bridges among people with different cultural backgrounds , yet sharing something in common , thus stimulating the cross-cultural communication . " the foundation is currently calling for applications for the second round of funding , which will carry on the aims of improving the integration of expats in brussels and also giving locals a better feeling for the international vocation of their city . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , they 've lived next to , not with , belgians .
a new integration project is trying to change that . one would think that brussels was a melting pot of social integration and interaction , given its mix of flemish and francophone locals and the large number of international residents tossed in for good measure .
but the international community seems to operate safely within its expat comfort zone while the locals get on with their lives alongside the distant foreigners . the king baudouin foundation , named after the country 's late monarch , is trying to change that .
its brexpat initiative aims to bring expats and local people closer together .
contacts between expats and locals are often limited or non-existent for reasons such has the temporary stay of expats , the language barrier and the financial gap , said brexpat project coordinator nosheen shakil . " we hope to start initiatives that bridge the gap between locals and expats , " shakil said .
" locals will , in this way , discover the extra value of living in the capital of europe and expats will feel less isolated and have the feeling to live in a real country , not on an expat island . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two communities live side-by-side but rarely interact brexpat was launched in march 2007 with a call for organizations in the region to submit applications for funding .
the groups had to have an expat partner and a brussels and could receive up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,200 -rrb- to help cover costs . the brussels celtic rugby club was one of the successful applicants .
the club , formed in 1998 by mostly irish expats and locals with the onus on creating an expat team with a real and tangible belgian element , has grown to embrace members from a total of 25 nationalities in all .
its expansion , however , had put a lot of pressure on its funds . " we have had to make all kinds of new investments and these , of course , cost a lot of money , " club secretary graham edwards said .
" the foundation 's financial support has been of enormous importance in helping us invest in the materials needed for a rugby club . " integration vital to city 's social fabric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports , including rugby , promote understanding edwards believes that team sports of any type , but especially rugby , are hugely effective at promoting understanding between different nationalities and cultures . " we strongly believe that our unique and very sociable identity and atmosphere is proof of the success of our founding concept and is the reason for our ever increasing success , " he said .
edwards also believes that communication between the expat community and locals in brussels and the surrounding areas is hugely important in maintaining the fabric of civil society . " just go to the paris banlieus if you want to see what , in extreme cases , can happen when cultures are not integrated in spite of living together , " he said . sports clubs are not the only organizations to benefit from the foundation 's initiative .
the gallery gabrichidze in brussels has also increased its reach thanks to funding support .
the gallery organizes international exhibitions for the local wallon and flemish communities and expats as well as workshops where the problems of migration , adaptation to belgian life and dealing with local bureaucracy are discussed . aiming to heal a divided nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is currently struggling with lingustic divisions " our aim is to unite the flemish , walloon and expat communities under one roof using creativity as a tool , " said gallery co-founder olena omelchenko .
" thanks to the funding , we are now able to focus on executing our projects without worrying about making profits to cover the losses . " omelchenko believes that , if brussels wants to keep its role as the capital of eu political and social life , then expats and locals should live together in more harmony and integration .
she says such harmony could then be used as a blueprint for the rest of the country .
" if belgium wants to keep itself together , then the walloons and the flemish should also find a way to cope with each other , " she said . " it is important to bring people together and struggle against negative factors which divide them . " while bringing people together is one of the objectives of the initiative , it also aims to promote the different cultures living in brussels .
liene reine , one of the organizers of the riga nights project , explained that foundation funds are helping to finance a cultural exchange between latvian , belgian and expat artists . understanding through cultural exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project promotes shared spaces in the city " our aim is to cover the lack of presence of latvian contemporary culture in brussels , " reine said .
" the riga nights project explores , discovers and establishes the possibilities of cooperation between latvian and belgian artists , while actively involving the expat community .
ideally the next phase would be to bring belgian artists to latvia . " we aim to create more than just a one-way cultural exposition , " she added .
" we want to create common spaces for common interactions and performances which will establish bridges among people with different cultural backgrounds , yet sharing something in common , thus stimulating the cross-cultural communication . " the foundation is currently calling for applications for the second round of funding , which will carry on the aims of improving the integration of expats in brussels and also giving locals a better feeling for the international vocation of their city . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peter hain has the ' full confidence ' of the prime minister tricky things , relaunches .
how far do you discard the past to present a vision of the future ?
under the real big ben this week gordon brown has again been wrestling with the dilemma of continuity versus change against a backdrop of poor poll ratings .
by the end of this week the plan was that the prime minister would have re-established his credentials as a strong leader of the country .
by stressing his ability to take difficult long term decisions for the country on public sector pay , the economy , health service and nuclear power , the prime minister would have put the travails of last year behind him .
instead the news is being dominated by stories of campaign donations and rule breaking which had been so damaging to labour before christmas on monday the relaunch began with health against the backdrop of david cameron 's claim that the conservatives were now the party of the nhs .
gordon brown announced a new screening programme but this had the hallmarks of a policy which had been rushed out ahead of time for political reasons .
the plan to screen men over 65 for " triple a " ¿ abdominal aortic aneurysms ¿ was uncontroversial but the other proposals were not .
dr surendra kumar from the national screening committee told us that they were not in favour of universal screening for stroke , diabetes and heart disease .
another aspect of the plan was that gps would offer a full health mot in surgeries but they too had n't been consulted about the proposals as laurence buckman from the bma said on the programme .
' winter of discontent ' in reply the health secretary alan johnson argued that sometimes it was best to lead from the front and defended the government 's stress on preventative medicine .
on tuesday the second prong of gordon brown 's " long term " strategy was also marred by a lack of consultation .
he announced proposals for a three year deal on public sector pay , somewhat reminiscent of the controversial incomes policy under james callaghan 's late 1970s labour government .
a labour adviser from that era , lord donoughue warned against the plan , saying that capping pay led to explosions further down the line -lrb- with the winter of discontent in his mind no doubt -rrb- .
paul kenny , from the gmb , told us the trade unions had not been consulted and the three year deal was doomed to failure .
the plan had been presented as a way of tackling inflation but the economist martin weale maintained there was little link as public sector pay had little effect on rises in the private sector .
his view was that gordon brown was trying to plug the gap in the public finances .
nuclear ' wriggle room ' on wednesday , as usual we were down in westminster for prime minister 's questions and a panel of senior backbenchers joined me .
keith vaz from the home affairs select committee had an interesting observation on id cards -lrb- tory leader david cameron 's main line of attack -rrb- .
he thought gordon brown had allowed himself " wriggle room " on a u-turn - perhaps not so surprising given the all the discgate problems .
an interesting one to watch .
the worry for labour must be that the political weather has not changed in the new year the final go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear power stations was given on thursday , a decision which had been long delayed by the government because it is so controversial especially in labour ranks .
we talked to the power company edf , whose chief executive told us they planned to build four new reactors in britain .
the cost of nuclear power is constantly questioned .
the environmentalist zac goldsmith challenged ministers to give one example of nuclear power stations which had been built without a public subsidy .
political funding i put that point to the business secretary john hutton who admitted there had not been one .
but he maintained that there would be no need for any in britain except in extremis and argued that nuclear power was needed as a cheap and clean source of electricity .
but by the end of the week those issues of policy had been overshadowed again by stories about political funding .
downing street has pledged " full confidence " in peter hain , the work and pensions secretary but there must be irritation in number 10 .
a journalist watching pmqs from the press gallery told me gordon brown physically turned away from peter hain when the issue was mentioned by an mp .
on friday came news that a complaint has been made to the parliamentary standards commissioner following the investigation by the electoral commission .
brian hanrahan interviewed opposition politicians who called for peter hain 's resignation on the grounds that a man who failed to keep account of his campaign funds should not be in charge of the biggest budget in whitehall .
the worry for labour must be that the political weather has not changed in the new year .
can there be any policies left to announce next week ?
here is a selection of your comments : lemmings will always head in the same direction every time they ' launch ' . down !
paul , bristol peter hains ' attitude just goes to show the contempt this government holds the people of this country in .
why bother voting ?
our politicians have lost the moral high ground for good !
john daramy , chesterfield / derbyshire uk pay : including the 26 % rise the tories gave mps before leaving office in 1997 mp 's salaries have risen 100 % in just over ten years .
teachers and nurses over the same period hover between 26 and 30 % .
jack lacey , rochester kent uk why would anyone spend £ 180k on a job application to come 5th ?
it tells us a lot about the individual and his misguided supporters .
what would happen if donations fell short of expenditure ?
the vanity and arrogance of our political leaders and supporters is breathtaking .
do we really have the cleanest system in the world .
richard wise , kings lynn uk .

under the real big ben this week gordon brown has again been wrestling with the dilemma of continuity versus change against a backdrop of poor poll ratings .
by the end of this week the plan was that the prime minister would have re-established his credentials as a strong leader of the country .
by stressing his ability to take difficult long term decisions for the country on public sector pay , the economy , health service and nuclear power , the prime minister would have put the travails of last year behind him .
instead the news is being dominated by stories of campaign donations and rule breaking which had been so damaging to labour before christmas on monday the relaunch began with health against the backdrop of david cameron 's claim that the conservatives were now the party of the nhs .
gordon brown announced a new screening programme but this had the hallmarks of a policy which had been rushed out ahead of time for political reasons .
the plan to screen men over 65 for " triple a " ¿ abdominal aortic aneurysms ¿ was uncontroversial but the other proposals were not .
dr surendra kumar from the national screening committee told us that they were not in favour of universal screening for stroke , diabetes and heart disease .
another aspect of the plan was that gps would offer a full health mot in surgeries but they too had n't been consulted about the proposals as laurence buckman from the bma said on the programme .
' winter of discontent ' in reply the health secretary alan johnson argued that sometimes it was best to lead from the front and defended the government 's stress on preventative medicine .
on tuesday the second prong of gordon brown 's " long term " strategy was also marred by a lack of consultation .
he announced proposals for a three year deal on public sector pay , somewhat reminiscent of the controversial incomes policy under james callaghan 's late 1970s labour government .
a labour adviser from that era , lord donoughue warned against the plan , saying that capping pay led to explosions further down the line -lrb- with the winter of discontent in his mind no doubt -rrb- .
paul kenny , from the gmb , told us the trade unions had not been consulted and the three year deal was doomed to failure .
the plan had been presented as a way of tackling inflation but the economist martin weale maintained there was little link as public sector pay had little effect on rises in the private sector .
his view was that gordon brown was trying to plug the gap in the public finances .

he thought gordon brown had allowed himself " wriggle room " on a u-turn - perhaps not so surprising given the all the discgate problems .
an interesting one to watch .
the worry for labour must be that the political weather has not changed in the new year the final go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear power stations was given on thursday , a decision which had been long delayed by the government because it is so controversial especially in labour ranks .
we talked to the power company edf , whose chief executive told us they planned to build four new reactors in britain .

but the truck , which goes on show at the detroit auto show , is likely to face stiff competition in a shrinking market , analysts said .
pickup truck sales , perhaps more than other car models , are suffering from the rising price of oil .
they also cater to the currently weak building and farming sectors .
such a focus on gas-guzzling pickup trucks , although there is still a market for them , is going a bit " against the grain " , says auto analyst michael robinet of csm , referring to how environmental concerns and regulation are forcing a shift towards smaller cars , many already being marketed by european and asian rivals .
healthcare reform this year 's detroit motor show comes against a background of growing concern about whether or not the us economy can avoid a recession .
for the us carmakers general motors , ford and chrysler , this comes on top of a long-running onslaught from rival car makers from both europe and asia .
but the american car giants are in the process of reforming themselves .
recent healthcare arrangements that have been struck between the carmakers and the unions should help speed up the process , analysts say .

there 'll be another detroit jody raffoul , musician think bruce springsteen meets bono .
think of the 1980s , of blue jeans , white t-shirts and black leather jackets .
and last , but not least , think of big , enviable american cars .
jody , through his music , offers a flashback to a time before motown - formerly famously confident and globally admired - crumpled into a pitiful shadow of its former self .
" my father worked for ford , all my uncles and my sister worked for chrysler , " jody says .
" i still have friends who work for the car companies , but i also know many who 've been laid off . "
out of work detroit and its canadian neighbour windsor have seen their automotive workforce halved in the last six years , observes sean mcalinden , chief economist and vice president of research at the center for automotive research in detroit .
consequently , the state of michigan has suffered what mr mcalinden describes as a " single-state recession " , its 7.5 % unemployment rate set to rise to 8.5 % by spring , well beyond the 5 % us average .
michigan has suffered " the highest unemployment rate in the us for the last four years " , observes mr mcalinden , hence the economy has become the key issue ahead of tuesday 's primary election in the state .
in the province of ontario , meanwhile , the jobless rate rose to 6.5 % in december , well beyond the 5.9 % canadian average .
pledge canada has been hit hard as the country 's dollar has soared to parity with the greenback , thus making exports to its main trading partner , the us , more expensive .
detroit is struggling to hang on as auto capital of the world hence , while jody spent friday night giving the locals ' rage and frustration a voice , canada 's prime minister stephen harper and the country 's premiers gathered for a four-hour dinner to hammer out a solution .
none was found .
instead , the night ended with " little more than a pledge to share ideas about how to shelter an economy that has just experienced its heaviest losses in almost five years " , the canadian newspaper the globe and mail wrote the following morning .
out of line the crisp night air hits the concert crowd as they pour into windsor 's broad and largely deserted streets .
across the detroit river , the us city 's brightly lit towers of power rise proudly towards the starry skies , their confident posture belying an enduring crisis that has pretty much ripped the underbelly out of motown in recent years .
even american buyers have been deserting detroit 's big three - general motors , ford and chrysler - who currently deliver only about half the cars sold in the us , having seen their market share slip 7 % in the last year .
their market share is declining in a market that is set to shrink this year to less than 16 million vehicle sales for the first time in a decade , amidst growing concern that the us is slipping into recession .
the sharp decline offers a stark warning , yet there are few signs that the slide is coming to a halt as detroit gets ready for this year 's auto show .
out of touch chrysler , the us carmaker that was recently sold by german group daimler to private equity investors , is set to make a big splash when it drives a herd of cattle through detroit 's streets on sunday to launch its new dodge ram pickup truck .
farmers have been arriving in detroit for chrysler 's cattle race ford , meanwhile , is going big on its redesigned f-150 pickup , the best-selling vehicle in the us .
such a focus on gas-guzzling pickup trucks , although there is still a market for them , is going a bit " against the grain " , says auto analyst michael robinet of csm , referring to how environmental concerns and regulation are forcing a shift towards smaller cars , many already being marketed by european and asian rivals .
the future , he predicts , will be one involving not only " a lot of changes to the type of vehicles built here " in the us .
in addition , there will be other " players who will be building cars here " .
these newcomers over time could include carmakers from india and china as well as existing ones such as toyota , hyundai and bmw , which have already invested massively further north in canada or in southern us states .
but they seem unlikely to build their new plants in detroit or windsor .
" there 'll be another detroit , " laments jody .
" there 'll be another usa . "
