the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .
5 , " steinbrueck said .
" there are currently different talks going on .

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .
the long-range effects will just be to start a new round of suffering , especially in the gaza strip and will motivate some militant people within palestine to try and hit israel any way they can . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .

the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.12.2008 germany , us defend israeli raids in gaza as protests mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense israeli bombardment of the gaza strip has caused havoc in the overcrowded territory germany and the us defend israel 's gaza air raids which have killed over 300 , saying they are meant to protect the country 's civilians even as pro-gaza protests grow in the arab world and europe . germany on monday blamed hamas for the outbreak of violence in the gaza strip and urged the islamist group which has controlled gaza since 2007 to stop firing rockets so that israel 's attack on the territory could end .
" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "
he said the eu could help to resolve this and help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .

the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .

tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .

" hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .

israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "
he said the eu could help to resolve this and help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rainer sollich israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2008 opinion : military action will not solve hamas problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has been bombarding targets in the gaza strip for three days now , claiming more than 300 lives .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rainer sollich israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rainer sollich israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .

the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .

steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .

only one of those five was very seriously ill .
hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .
meyer added that kusch was challenging the restraining order in court . november 's search was triggered by several investigations being conducted into his activities .
the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .
kusch does not himself directly assist in the suicides as this would be illegal under german law . but he advertizes his services as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those wishing to die .
service cost 8,000 euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in switzerland , assisted suicide is legal , as it is in belgium and the netherlands on his web site kusch lists 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,110 -rrb- as his charge , with reductions possible in cases of financial hardship .
" i provide a service .
it 's of value , and in our society such things do not come free , " kusch told afp news agency in early december . " some elderly people come to see me because just they are tired of life , " he said .
" many people now live longer thanks to progress in medicine .
but living on is sometimes seen as senseless .
and there are many people over 80 who do n't really see the point of going on , " he added .
in germany , as in many other european countries , the number of suicides has been dropping - except for those of older people , especially men over 75 , according to official statistics .
more than 40 percent of those who are reported as taking their own lives in germany last year were aged over 60 - 3,993 out of 9,402 - even though this age group accounts for only 25 percent of the population .
and it is believed the real number could be much higher .

only one of those five was very seriously ill .
hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .
meyer added that kusch was challenging the restraining order in court . november 's search was triggered by several investigations being conducted into his activities .
the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .
kusch does not himself directly assist in the suicides as this would be illegal under german law . but he advertizes his services as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those wishing to die .

" i provide a service .
it 's of value , and in our society such things do not come free , " kusch told afp news agency in early december . " some elderly people come to see me because just they are tired of life , " he said .
" many people now live longer thanks to progress in medicine .
but living on is sometimes seen as senseless .
and there are many people over 80 who do n't really see the point of going on , " he added .
in germany , as in many other european countries , the number of suicides has been dropping - except for those of older people , especially men over 75 , according to official statistics .
more than 40 percent of those who are reported as taking their own lives in germany last year were aged over 60 - 3,993 out of 9,402 - even though this age group accounts for only 25 percent of the population .

former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .

the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .

tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.12.2008 steinmeier calls for aid for automakers , tax cuts for germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says tax cuts would boost car sales germany 's foreign minister and contender for the country 's chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier , has said the government should create incentives for people to buy cars . steinmeier told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the german government also needed to prepare an aid package for german automakers suffering under the global economic downturn .
the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .
5 , " steinbrueck said .
" there are currently different talks going on .
i am trying to ensure that we do not totally lose sight of the basic tenets of budget consolidation and fairness towards -lrb- future -rrb- generations , and that we act with the necessary prudence .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.12.2008 mideast ca n't achieve peace without eu involvement : expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worries of a prolonged conflict intensified monday as israeli tanks amassed near gaza 's border as israel continued to bombard the hamas-governed gaza strip for a third day , jochen hippler , a german expert on the middle east , told dw-world.de the european union bears some of the blame for the situation . jochen hippler , a researcher and expert on the middle east at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- , told dw-world.de in an interview that the current escalation in violence in gaza would not help to bring about peace .
“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .
the long-range effects will just be to start a new round of suffering , especially in the gaza strip and will motivate some militant people within palestine to try and hit israel any way they can . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rainer sollich israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .

israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .

israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "

" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .

the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "

tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .

he deplores that violence is continuing today , and he strongly urges once again an immediate stop to all acts of violence .

" massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks . " gilad shalit is an asset for hamas and the organization will do everything to keep him alive , " said an israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity .

"
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .

hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .

the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2008 opinion : military action will not solve hamas problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has been bombarding targets in the gaza strip for three days now , claiming more than 300 lives .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ? # b # israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .
the long-range effects will just be to start a new round of suffering , especially in the gaza strip and will motivate some militant people within palestine to try and hit israel any way they can . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .

the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .

steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he deplores that violence is continuing today , and he strongly urges once again an immediate stop to all acts of violence . " montas said the un humanitarian coordinator in gaza received a guarantee from israeli officials on sunday that " all required humanitarian supplies and personnel " would be allowed into gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has called for an immediate end to the violence " the secretary general fully expects this cooperation to continue on a rolling basis in the coming days , " she added . israeli defense minister ehud barak on sunday authorized the transfer of more than 100 truckloads of aid into gaza . more than 100 trucks will transfer the goods on monday through the karni , nahal oz and kerem shalom crossings between israel and the territory ruled by the islamist movement hamas , barak 's office said . the 15-member un security council on sunday issued a non-binding statement calling for " an immediate halt to all violence " in the gaza strip and urged the parties " to stop immediately all military activities . " massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks . " gilad shalit is an asset for hamas and the organization will do everything to keep him alive , " said an israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" israel holds hamas responsible for his well-being . " fears of an israeli ground offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high numbers of casualties made saturday the single deadliest day in the gaza strip since israel 's occupation of the territory in 1967 israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's cabinet has approved a call-up of 6,500 reservists and there are reports of israeli tanks deploying on the edge of the gaza strip in preparation for a possible ground incursion into the enclave . " i fear that a possible israeli ground offensive in the gaza strip will have repercussions for other regions in the middle east , " german politician ruprecht polenz , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the rheinische post in an interview to be published monday . in light of the latest escalation of violence , polenz said he feared a " dangerous development that could easily turn into a conflagration . "
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .
20 . " obama ca n't allow himself to repeat the mistakes of his predecessors bush and clinton who both paid attention to israel and palestine only towards the end of their respective terms , " polenz said . us president-elect barack obama is reported to have been briefed on the weekend by us secretary of state condoleezza rice about the israeli bombardment of gaza . but obama gave no hint of future us policy on the mideast conflict .
his national security spokeswoman , brooke anderson said obama would make no comment , saying he was sticking to the formula that there should be " one president at a time . " " new spiral of despair " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble following an israeli air strike in rafah the latest violence has stoked fears in the european union , one of israel 's most important foreign partners as well as the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , that the region may slide into instability . eu high representative javier solana on saturday condemned as " unacceptable " the death of palestinian civilians in the israeli air strikes and called for an immediate end to the violence . france , which hold the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , is working to get both sides back to the negotiating table . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in an interview that he is rallying european nations to use " all their weight " to stop fighting between israel and hamas .

he deplores that violence is continuing today , and he strongly urges once again an immediate stop to all acts of violence . " montas said the un humanitarian coordinator in gaza received a guarantee from israeli officials on sunday that " all required humanitarian supplies and personnel " would be allowed into gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has called for an immediate end to the violence " the secretary general fully expects this cooperation to continue on a rolling basis in the coming days , " she added . israeli defense minister ehud barak on sunday authorized the transfer of more than 100 truckloads of aid into gaza . more than 100 trucks will transfer the goods on monday through the karni , nahal oz and kerem shalom crossings between israel and the territory ruled by the islamist movement hamas , barak 's office said . the 15-member un security council on sunday issued a non-binding statement calling for " an immediate halt to all violence " in the gaza strip and urged the parties " to stop immediately all military activities . " massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks . " gilad shalit is an asset for hamas and the organization will do everything to keep him alive , " said an israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" israel holds hamas responsible for his well-being . " fears of an israeli ground offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high numbers of casualties made saturday the single deadliest day in the gaza strip since israel 's occupation of the territory in 1967 israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's cabinet has approved a call-up of 6,500 reservists and there are reports of israeli tanks deploying on the edge of the gaza strip in preparation for a possible ground incursion into the enclave . " i fear that a possible israeli ground offensive in the gaza strip will have repercussions for other regions in the middle east , " german politician ruprecht polenz , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the rheinische post in an interview to be published monday . in light of the latest escalation of violence , polenz said he feared a " dangerous development that could easily turn into a conflagration . "
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .
20 . " obama ca n't allow himself to repeat the mistakes of his predecessors bush and clinton who both paid attention to israel and palestine only towards the end of their respective terms , " polenz said . us president-elect barack obama is reported to have been briefed on the weekend by us secretary of state condoleezza rice about the israeli bombardment of gaza . but obama gave no hint of future us policy on the mideast conflict .
his national security spokeswoman , brooke anderson said obama would make no comment , saying he was sticking to the formula that there should be " one president at a time . " " new spiral of despair " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble following an israeli air strike in rafah the latest violence has stoked fears in the european union , one of israel 's most important foreign partners as well as the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , that the region may slide into instability . eu high representative javier solana on saturday condemned as " unacceptable " the death of palestinian civilians in the israeli air strikes and called for an immediate end to the violence . france , which hold the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , is working to get both sides back to the negotiating table . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in an interview that he is rallying european nations to use " all their weight " to stop fighting between israel and hamas .

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .
5 , " steinbrueck said .
" there are currently different talks going on .
i am trying to ensure that we do not totally lose sight of the basic tenets of budget consolidation and fairness towards -lrb- future -rrb- generations , and that we act with the necessary prudence .

only one of those five was very seriously ill .
hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .
meyer added that kusch was challenging the restraining order in court . november 's search was triggered by several investigations being conducted into his activities .
the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .
kusch does not himself directly assist in the suicides as this would be illegal under german law . but he advertizes his services as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those wishing to die .

he deplores that violence is continuing today , and he strongly urges once again an immediate stop to all acts of violence . " montas said the un humanitarian coordinator in gaza received a guarantee from israeli officials on sunday that " all required humanitarian supplies and personnel " would be allowed into gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has called for an immediate end to the violence " the secretary general fully expects this cooperation to continue on a rolling basis in the coming days , " she added . israeli defense minister ehud barak on sunday authorized the transfer of more than 100 truckloads of aid into gaza . more than 100 trucks will transfer the goods on monday through the karni , nahal oz and kerem shalom crossings between israel and the territory ruled by the islamist movement hamas , barak 's office said . the 15-member un security council on sunday issued a non-binding statement calling for " an immediate halt to all violence " in the gaza strip and urged the parties " to stop immediately all military activities . " massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks . " gilad shalit is an asset for hamas and the organization will do everything to keep him alive , " said an israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" israel holds hamas responsible for his well-being . " fears of an israeli ground offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high numbers of casualties made saturday the single deadliest day in the gaza strip since israel 's occupation of the territory in 1967 israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's cabinet has approved a call-up of 6,500 reservists and there are reports of israeli tanks deploying on the edge of the gaza strip in preparation for a possible ground incursion into the enclave . " i fear that a possible israeli ground offensive in the gaza strip will have repercussions for other regions in the middle east , " german politician ruprecht polenz , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the rheinische post in an interview to be published monday . in light of the latest escalation of violence , polenz said he feared a " dangerous development that could easily turn into a conflagration . "
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .
20 . " obama ca n't allow himself to repeat the mistakes of his predecessors bush and clinton who both paid attention to israel and palestine only towards the end of their respective terms , " polenz said . us president-elect barack obama is reported to have been briefed on the weekend by us secretary of state condoleezza rice about the israeli bombardment of gaza . but obama gave no hint of future us policy on the mideast conflict .
his national security spokeswoman , brooke anderson said obama would make no comment , saying he was sticking to the formula that there should be " one president at a time . " " new spiral of despair " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble following an israeli air strike in rafah the latest violence has stoked fears in the european union , one of israel 's most important foreign partners as well as the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , that the region may slide into instability . eu high representative javier solana on saturday condemned as " unacceptable " the death of palestinian civilians in the israeli air strikes and called for an immediate end to the violence . france , which hold the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , is working to get both sides back to the negotiating table . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in an interview that he is rallying european nations to use " all their weight " to stop fighting between israel and hamas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.12.2008 euro turns 10 as experts heap praise on single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the single currency has shielded the euro zone from increased financial turmoil the european single currency has acted as a windbreaker against the global financial storm for euro zone businesses and citizens , financial experts said monday , dec .
29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.12.2008 euro turns 10 as experts heap praise on single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the single currency has shielded the euro zone from increased financial turmoil the european single currency has acted as a windbreaker against the global financial storm for euro zone businesses and citizens , financial experts said monday , dec .
29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "
he said the eu could help to resolve this and help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks .

"
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

" massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks .

"
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .

steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .

the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”

the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .

looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ? # b # israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ? # b # israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .
all that could really endanger the organization 's position would be tangible improvements in the lives of the palestinians in gaza and a solution to the middle east conflict for all sides concerned .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .
the long-range effects will just be to start a new round of suffering , especially in the gaza strip and will motivate some militant people within palestine to try and hit israel any way they can . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .

the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .

only one of those five was very seriously ill .
hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .
meyer added that kusch was challenging the restraining order in court . november 's search was triggered by several investigations being conducted into his activities .
the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .
kusch does not himself directly assist in the suicides as this would be illegal under german law . but he advertizes his services as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those wishing to die .
service cost 8,000 euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in switzerland , assisted suicide is legal , as it is in belgium and the netherlands on his web site kusch lists 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,110 -rrb- as his charge , with reductions possible in cases of financial hardship .
" i provide a service .
it 's of value , and in our society such things do not come free , " kusch told afp news agency in early december . " some elderly people come to see me because just they are tired of life , " he said .
" many people now live longer thanks to progress in medicine .
but living on is sometimes seen as senseless .
and there are many people over 80 who do n't really see the point of going on , " he added .
in germany , as in many other european countries , the number of suicides has been dropping - except for those of older people , especially men over 75 , according to official statistics .
more than 40 percent of those who are reported as taking their own lives in germany last year were aged over 60 - 3,993 out of 9,402 - even though this age group accounts for only 25 percent of the population .
and it is believed the real number could be much higher .
kusch is calling for the legalization of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the auto business is germany 's largest industry and biggest export , prompting steinmeier to label it " the spinal cord of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- economy . "
" we must also stimulate the purchasing of automobiles with state incentives , " such as tax breaks , said the foreign minister .
one in seven german workers is directly or indirectly involved in the car industry , the german auto manufacturers ' association vda has said .
new car registrations in germany fell 18 percent in november against figures from the same month last year , vda said last month .
steinmeier , who is the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate expected to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel in general elections next september , has long favored government protection of the german auto industry .
government under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel insists her government is doing enough to fight recession merkel , meanwhile , has so far been reluctant to pledge financial aid to german carmakers , such as gm-owned opel , on fears the funds could find their way to parent companies based abroad .
the german government and opel have put on pause talks over a potential aid package involving up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees .
the negotiations are set to resume early next year .
in recent weeks merkel has been forced to dismiss claims that europe 's largest economy was not doing enough to deal with the financial crisis , saying germany would not be drawn into " a competition for subsidies and the spending of billions " in state aid .
berlin 's contribution to an eu-wide bailout scheme is a 32-billion-euro stimulus package over the next two years which is expected to result in a 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment , merkel has said .
the chancellor has called a cabinet meeting for jan .
5 to discuss a second possible stimulus package .
steinbrueck rejects tax cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck has spoken out against tax cuts german finance minister peer steinbrueck has signaled that any package to come from the january cabinet talks could include measures for the german auto industry , news agency afp reported monday .
the minister rejected , however , the inclusion of tax breaks or shopping vouchers in a second package to help boost spending .
steinbrueck said that cutting people 's health insurance contributions would be much more effective in putting cash in consumers ' pockets than cutting taxes because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
he stressed that a second package would not be finalized at the january meeting .
" no decisions will be taken on jan .
5 , " steinbrueck said .
" there are currently different talks going on .
i am trying to ensure that we do not totally lose sight of the basic tenets of budget consolidation and fairness towards -lrb- future -rrb- generations , and that we act with the necessary prudence .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ? # b # israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .

lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .
hamas will remain dangerous even if it is temporarily weakened by the current action .
in fact , the organization will receive a moral boost from the current development and also garner support in the west bank .
hamas could probably withstand in the long-term the loss of staff and infrastructure , even a possible violent end to its government in the gaza strip .

he deplores that violence is continuing today , and he strongly urges once again an immediate stop to all acts of violence . " montas said the un humanitarian coordinator in gaza received a guarantee from israeli officials on sunday that " all required humanitarian supplies and personnel " would be allowed into gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has called for an immediate end to the violence " the secretary general fully expects this cooperation to continue on a rolling basis in the coming days , " she added . israeli defense minister ehud barak on sunday authorized the transfer of more than 100 truckloads of aid into gaza . more than 100 trucks will transfer the goods on monday through the karni , nahal oz and kerem shalom crossings between israel and the territory ruled by the islamist movement hamas , barak 's office said . the 15-member un security council on sunday issued a non-binding statement calling for " an immediate halt to all violence " in the gaza strip and urged the parties " to stop immediately all military activities . " massive air raids the statement followed massive israeli air raids on gaza on saturday and sunday , in retaliation for palestinian militants ' repeated rocket attacks on israel .
the israeli attacks have so far killed more than 300 people and wounded some 600 , medics said . the israel air force bombed gaza again monday morning , hitting 40 targets of the islamic hamas movement that rules the area , an israeli army spokesman said . one of the targets struck by israeli bombs early monday was a building of the islamic university in gaza and a guesthouse of the de facto hamas government .
a building near the residence of hamas leader ismail haniya was also reported hit . israeli media reported monday , quoting palestinian sources , that an israeli soldier held captive in gaza by hamas for more than two years , gilad shalit , was also injured in one of the attacks . " gilad shalit is an asset for hamas and the organization will do everything to keep him alive , " said an israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity .

" i fear that a possible israeli ground offensive in the gaza strip will have repercussions for other regions in the middle east , " german politician ruprecht polenz , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the rheinische post in an interview to be published monday . in light of the latest escalation of violence , polenz said he feared a " dangerous development that could easily turn into a conflagration . "
german politicians have expressed sympathy for israel which has been under regular rocket fire attack from the gaza strip ever since hamas announced the end of a ceasefire a week ago .
but israel has to do more to ease tough living conditions in gaza and avoid civilian casualties , they say . no country in the world would accept daily rocket attacks on its citizens , polenz said , adding that israel had not managed to send clear signals to the west bank that the palestinians had much to gain if they cooperated with israel rather than backing violence . politician urges obama to tackle mideast conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama this year voiced strong support for israel polenz , who is also the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the german parliament called on us president-elect barack obama to place the middle east high on his agenda when he takes office on jan .
20 . " obama ca n't allow himself to repeat the mistakes of his predecessors bush and clinton who both paid attention to israel and palestine only towards the end of their respective terms , " polenz said . us president-elect barack obama is reported to have been briefed on the weekend by us secretary of state condoleezza rice about the israeli bombardment of gaza . but obama gave no hint of future us policy on the mideast conflict .
his national security spokeswoman , brooke anderson said obama would make no comment , saying he was sticking to the formula that there should be " one president at a time . " " new spiral of despair " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble following an israeli air strike in rafah the latest violence has stoked fears in the european union , one of israel 's most important foreign partners as well as the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , that the region may slide into instability . eu high representative javier solana on saturday condemned as " unacceptable " the death of palestinian civilians in the israeli air strikes and called for an immediate end to the violence . france , which hold the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , is working to get both sides back to the negotiating table . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in an interview that he is rallying european nations to use " all their weight " to stop fighting between israel and hamas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 29.12.2008 european press review : middle east peace suffers new setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians are caught in the middle european newspapers criticized both hamas and israel for the eruption of violence which has left more than 300 dead .
editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 29.12.2008 european press review : middle east peace suffers new setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians are caught in the middle european newspapers criticized both hamas and israel for the eruption of violence which has left more than 300 dead .
editorial writers were skeptical that the fighting would bring peace to the middle east . some newspapers focused on the futility of israel 's attacks .
others focused on the backlash that will likely come from neighboring countries .
but there was general agreement that the recent attacks will do nothing to further peace in the middle east .
the handelsblatt from the western german city of dusseldorf saw the cynicism of the attacks .
" there have been years of provocation , " the newspaper wrote .
" even after israel finally removed the last settlers and all soldiers from the gaza strip , the radical islamist hamas did not keep quiet .
hamas had only one goal : to defeat israel .
and it is not shrinking away from using palestinians in gaza as hostages .
it does not get any more cynical . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will israel come out looking like the bad guys ?
several british newspapers criticized israel not only for the attacks but as strategic error that plays into the hands of islamist militants .
the financial times said the air strikes were " disproportionate " and " trying to crush hamas from the air was self-defeating . "
" it further enrages arab and muslim opinion against israel and its us allies , and strengthens the appeal of islamist radicals , " wrote the business daily .
" and just as hezbollah was aggrandized by israel 's misfired 34-days war on lebanon in 2006 , so hamas now stands to gain if it can hold its ground . "
britain 's center-left guardian shared a similar view : " there has been no diminution of support for hamas in gaza , as a result of israel 's policy of blockading it , and support for hamas may well rise as a result of these air strikes , " it wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting has provoked anger in the muslim world britain 's conservative daily telegraph placed most of the blame on hamas for abandoning an egyptian-brokered ceasefire and accused the group of firing rockets in the hope of provoking a furious reaction .
" hamas was not expecting retribution on this scale , but we can be sure that it will extract the maximum possible propaganda advantage from the slaughter , " it wrote .
" hamas is not a reasonable political movement .
it can not thrive without crisis ; the blood of innocents is its own lifeblood . "
the french newspaper la croix was also critical of hamas .
" the unilateral rupture by hamas of the ceasefire between israel and the islamist movement is without doubt more serious and will have more serious consequences , " wrote the catholic daily .
bildunterschrift : hamas was criticized for breaking a ceasefire the daily le figaro said hamas had taken a " hard line policy against all western influence in the region " and said finding a way back to the path of peace " rests in large part on the actions to come from barack obama . "
the salzburger nachrichten doubted that israel 's military action would provide some type of resolution to the conflict in the middle east .
israel wants to " radically change the reality in southern israel , " the newspaper wrote .
" but it remains questionable whether the massive military strike can accomplish this , " the newspaper said .
" israel should not launch a war only against extremists .
it also needs to make peace with moderates . "
luxembourg 's wort newspaper noted that the radical islamist hamas threatens the survival of both israel and other moderate regimes in the region .
the newspaper saw the swift attacks as sending a signal to iran about israel 's strength .
" while both movements are politically and logistically supported by teheran , israel 's action on sabbath was a clear signal to iran .
in less than three minutes , 200 hamas installations had been damaged .
according to medical sources , a maximum of 15 civilians were killed .
that is 15 too many , but the military operation was aimed in particular at teheran in increasing the respect for the logistics and military capabilities of the israeli air force .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .

israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "
he said the eu could help to resolve this and help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .

" hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .

israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .

" it is the legitimate right of israel to protect its civilian population and to defend its territory , " german government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , agrees with olmert that hamas is responsible for the latest escalation german chancellor angela merkel and israeli prime minister ehud olmert had agreed in a telephone conversation that responsibility for the escalation lay " clearly and exclusively with hamas , " steg said . " hamas has unilaterally broken the ceasefire agreement . " merkel also urged olmert to ensure that steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties and allow urgently needed humanitarian supplies across the border into gaza , steg said .
he added that the chancellor believed the conflict could only be resolved through a political process at the end of which there was a two-state solution . un chief calls for immediate ceasefire germany 's support for israel , stronger than that shown by some other european countries , comes as the jewish state launched deadly air strikes in the last three days that have killed more than 300 palestinians and triggered international condemnation . un secretary-general ban ki-moon admonished world leaders on monday for not doing enough to halt what he called an " unacceptable " level of violence in gaza and press for a long-term political solution . the french foreign ministry said european union foreign ministers will meet in paris on tuesday to discuss the israeli attack on gaza . the german government 's stance on the gaza violence was echoed by washington with the white house saying monday israel had assured the us that it was not looking to " retake " the gaza strip through its military operations against the radical islamic organization hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens .
" the united states understands that israel needs to take actions to defend itself , " said spokesman gordon johndroe .
" hamas has once again shown its true colors as a terrorist organization that refuses to even recognize israel 's right to exist , " he said , adding that hamas had to agree to respect a " sustainable and durable ceasefire . " deep anger on arab street more than 300 palestinians have been killed and many more wounded since israel launched air strikes in the enclave on saturday , eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce .
israel says its southern towns have been under nearly daily rocket fire and mortar shelling from the gaza strip ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster inside gaza the un has said almost 60 of those killed in the gaza strip are civilians .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
johndroe also confirmed that king abdullah of saudi arabia had told outgoing president george w. bush of the deep anger in the arab world about israel 's actions .
" the president 's message to king abdullah , his overall message is that we want to see the violence stop , but in a way that leads to a durable and sustainable cessation of violence .
we ca n't have the violence stop now only for it to start up again , " said johndroe .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has called on hamas to engage in dialog to find a solution to the situation . anti-israeli demonstrations grow meanwhile , more than 1,000 people demonstrated peacefully in berlin against israel 's military operation in gaza . the action was mounted by several arab organizations .
ahmed muhaisen , chairman of the palestinian community in the german capital , said the protesters wanted to express their solidarity with the palestinian people .
in the middle east , there have been bigger , widespread protests with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets of tehran .
tens of thousands of lebanese shi 'ite protesters , chanting " death to america , death to israel , " massed in beirut on monday .
in the jordanian capital , amman , about 20,000 people staged a demonstration organized by the mainstream muslim brotherhood , while in cairo 1,000 people rallied to show solidarity with gaza palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish demonstrators in istanbul shout slogans as they protest against israel 's gaza raids in athens , police broke up demonstrations with tear gas while demonstrators gathered for a second day outside the israeli embassy in london on monday to protest against israel 's air raids in gaza .
israel said monday that its campaign against the radical islamic hamas movement would be further expanded if necessary .
defense minister ehud barak spoke of an " all-out war " with hamas .
" this operation will be widened and deepened as much as is required .
we know what the goals are and we are moving toward them with determination , " barak told a special session of israel 's parliament , the knesset , in jerusalem .
barak said the operation was not the result of " revenge feelings " or " fury , " but came after meticulous preparations , which were " carried out with a heavy head and responsibly . "
barak reiterated that israel held hamas responsible for the offensive , arguing rocket attacks from the strip had continued and intensified despite israel 's unilateral pullout of all its troops and settlers from the strip more than three years ago .
expert criticizes european failures in mideast german middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de that the new escalation in violence would not help to bring about peace - even though israel 's aim to stop the rocket attacks was legitimate .
hippler , a researcher at the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for development and peace -lrb- inef -rrb- also criticized europe 's stance in the middle east in recent years .
" europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , " he said .
" instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.12.2008 euro turns 10 as experts heap praise on single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the single currency has shielded the euro zone from increased financial turmoil the european single currency has acted as a windbreaker against the global financial storm for euro zone businesses and citizens , financial experts said monday , dec .
29 . consensus is widespread that the strength of the currency has done for some european countries what would have been impossible had they kept their original monies .
the assessment came a few days ahead of the 10th anniversary of the euro being used as a virtual currency in accounting and financial transactions in the euro zone .
euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until jan .
1 , 2002 .
former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .
single currency firms in importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's exchange rate against the dollar peaked in july this year at $ 1.60 having boosted trade among its members and created at least 16 million jobs since its inception , the euro has begun to firm as a premier globally reliable currency .
the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former german central bank president hans tietmeyer said the 16 euro zone member states had so far escaped foreign exchange turmoil because of the single currency .
" we would probably have had a series of currency crises , " tietmeyer told afp news agency .
eu commission president jose barroso has also sung the euro 's praises , insisting recently that " the euro is sheltering businesses from the exchange rate volatility which has battered them in previous downturns . "
ecb central to euro strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb , under president jean-claude trichet , has drastically lowered interest rates tietmeyer said the euro zone 's stable position has been underpinned by the creation of the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in 1998 .
" as a result , the single currency has without doubt benefited the people and the economy of europe , " he said .
the ecb has been able to sharply lower interest rates during the current crisis , something bank of america economist gilles moec said would not have been possible for countries such as italy and greece pre-1998 .
" economic policies were completely sterilized then , you could do nothing , " he said .
" we would never have gotten the interest rate cuts we have had in europe over the past year , " when the ecb slashed its benchmark lending rate to 2.50 percent , with more to come in 2009 .

the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .

tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "

the euro zone is responsible for 16.5 percent of global economic activity , while the euro currency accounts for over a quarter of the world 's official foreign reserves , up from 18 percent in 1998 .
this has led many europeans to feel their currency will supplant the us dollar in global importance within the next five years , according to a survey by the financial times business newspaper and harris polling released monday .
the poll showed that around 70 percent of spaniards and two-thirds of french people believed " strongly " or " somewhat " that the euro would overtake the dollar in global importance .
nearly 60 percent of germans polled agreed with the statement , while just over 60 percent in italy concurred .
one third of germans polled also said their country would n't return to growth " in the foreseeable future . "
testing times ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia will join the euro zone in the new year but with the current economic crisis has come the sternest test yet of the single currency , which is used by some 329 million euro zone residents .
tietmeyer said he expected the euro zone to weather the current storm , but added that if pan-euro zone ecb monetary polices do not do the job for all member states , " it could lead to conflict between members states , which could be very damaging . "
he said that differences in wage costs and fiscal discipline were issues " that we are seeing now in some countries . "
euro zone membership is now obligatory for all new eu member states , while britain , denmark and sweden have a right to maintain their traditional currencies , though some leaders in those countries are now questioning the wisdom in continuing to do so .
poland , czech republic , hungary , the baltic countries and romania are all aiming to take up the euro within the next six years , but their pledge-dates have been second guessed as a result of instability created by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg police chief ralf meyer said the injunction against kusch had already been verbally issued during a search of his premises at the end of november .
meyer added that kusch was challenging the restraining order in court . november 's search was triggered by several investigations being conducted into his activities .
the former politician and judge is suspected of violating germany 's medical drugs law - by illegally dispensing and trading in medicines .

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2008 opinion : military action will not solve hamas problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has been bombarding targets in the gaza strip for three days now , claiming more than 300 lives .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich wonders whether this is really the right way to defeat hamas in the long run . by unilaterally ending their ceasefire nine days ago and launching rocket attacks on israeli residential areas , hamas clearly carries the main burden of guilt for the current escalation of violence .
the militant islamic organization did not only consciously risk this military response from israel , but actually went out of its way to provoke this response - even if they were taken by surprise by the time and the scale of the operation .
winning the war , but losing the peace ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rainer sollich israel clearly has the right to defend its citizens from attack .
you also can not expect israel to show any consideration towards the members of a movement that has always rejected the right of the jewish state to exist and used violence against it .
but all democratic states should distinguish themselves from opponents of this kind by sparing citizens ' lives as much as humanly possible .
from what can be gathered from international media reports and tv footage from gaza , it is doubtful whether the israeli campaign can be regarded as a measured response to hamas ' actions .
it is very difficult to spare innocent lives in the densely populated gaza strip because hamas has purposely set up its own headquarters in residential areas for its own protection .
but how seriously has israel tried to do this ?
and how seriously does israel rate the military operation 's chance of success ?
at the end of the day israel can only really stand to lose .
the uproar on the arab street about the bloodshed in gaza will continue to grow from hour to hour and is already weakening the position of those who are in favor of a historic peace settlement with israel .
in the worst case scenario , the violence could spread uncontrollably .
lebanon 's hezbollah militia has already put its fighters on alert .
iran has expressed its unreserved solidarity with hamas .
the international community can not simply sit back and watch as more and more people die and the danger of a regional conflagration in the middle east grows .
it has to do its utmost to get both sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire .
israel should not cherish any illusions .

“ we have a situation where one side is retaliating against the other and vice versa .
the palestinians will retaliate against israeli violence and we have to solve this problem , " he said .
hippler said the longer that the violence continues , the more difficult it will be to come to a peaceful solution .
the european union - which has been the biggest sponsor of development projects within the palestinian authority , but has not wielded the political clout of the united states - needs to step up to the plate when it comes to negotiating a workable initiative for peace , according to the middle east expert .
“ europe has made a couple of mistakes in the last couple of years , ” hippler said .
“ instead of respecting the elections -lrb- that brought hamas to power -rrb- and dealing with someone they do n't like , they 've helped to trigger a kind of civil war among palestinians .
and you ca n't have peace with an opponent that is at war with itself . ”
the eu 's decision to upgrade bilateral relations between israel and european union member states in june has also stirred anger in the arab world .
hippler said finding a peaceful solution would have been easier 10 to 15 years ago .
“ the main challenge we face now is finding a permanent political solution .
but there is no political will to do it . ”
the eu , he said , could resolve help to reduce tensions by bringing hamas to the table .
“ we have seen examples where negotiating with hamas has been successful .
but to achieve a ceasefire , the only way is to agree to a mutual ceasefire . ”
legitimate goal of peace will not be achieved in any case , hippler said , the official goals of israel 's military action - to stop the rocket attacks - will not be met .
“ it 's a legitimate goal .
the people of israel have every right to live in peace as the palestinians do .
the problem is that this war will not change those attacks .
the long-range effects will just be to start a new round of suffering , especially in the gaza strip and will motivate some militant people within palestine to try and hit israel any way they can . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" we bid to win and to stage the winter games 2018 , " bach told german news agency dpa .
munich is bidding together with fellow bavarian town garmisch-partenkirchen and thuringian town koenigssee in a compact concept .
munich would hold ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen snow events and koenigssee sliding events .
the german bid will not stand unopposed , however , with a host of other european and asian countries , including france and china , also said to be preparing bids for 2018 .
the ioc is to decide on the host city at a session in durban , south africa , in 2011 .
if the bavarian capital is successful it would be the first city in history to host both summer and winter olympics , following the 1972 games .
" -lrb- the bid -rrb- follows in the olympic tradition from 1972 , which , up to the terrible attack by palestinian -lrb- militants -rrb- on the israeli team , was remembered for its cheerful atmosphere , " said bach , who is also president of the german olympic sports confederation .
berlin success could boost munich hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach says a successful berlin world championships would not harm munich 's cause bach said that a successful iaaf world championships in athletics in berlin in 2009 could give a boost to munich 's 2018 games hopes .
" everyone in german sports is interested in the worlds being a success and that germany presents itself as a likeable , friendly and well-organized host , " he told dpa .
looking back , bach hailed the 2008 olympics in beijing as " a great event " with the chinese hosts offering " outstanding hospitality " and " brilliant conditions " for the athletes .
he said the event had helped china open up to the world and raised its environmental consciousness .
bach added that the olympic games concept was able to have a positive effect on human rights conditions , but " could not offer solutions for political problems , " especially if politics itself had not solved such issues .
the beijing games were held with a backdrop of ongoing tensions over the independence movement in tibet and concerns over freedom of expression in china .
but bach went on to issue a warning to london 2012 games organizers , insisting that it would be difficult to top the class and grandeur of the beijing games .
" my advice to london is to do it differently .
it is part of the olympic fascination that each country brings its own understanding of culture and sports into the organization , " bach said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in fact , they are the biggest indication yet of russia 's long-term plans to invest heavily in abkhazia .
the gravel they are extracting from the kodori river bed is destined for the russian city of sochi , further north along the black sea coast , for use in one of its most important building projects in the next decade , the 2014 winter olympics .
russia backed abkhazia 's declaration of independence in august 2008 and is the territory 's most prominent supporter .
the two agreed to co-operate long before georgia 's august war with russia .
russian money now redevelopment is going ahead on a grand scale , despite georgia 's assertion that abkhazia is still legally one of its territories . "
thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically " kristina ozgan , abkhazia 's finance minister in the capital , sukhumi , new restaurants , hotels and entertainment attractions line the black sea promenade .
many have been renovated with russian money .
this new wave of investment marks a welcome change for a tiny seaside territory where war is never far from the memory .
houses , government buildings and palaces still lie in ruins after the war for independence against georgia in the early 1990s .
a subsequent economic blockade by georgia froze development plans .
abkhazia 's finance minister , kristina ozgan , welcomes the recent change .
anyone , not just russia , should feel welcome to invest in abkhazia , she says .
" you have to understand , abkhazia does not select which business comes here , it invites business .
other countries do n't want to work here without guarantees , but russia does . "
she refuses to name a figure , but suggests russian investment amounts to more than £ 68m -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- this year alone .
" thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically , " she tells me .
outside , i notice a large roadside billboard poster in which russian president dmitry medvedev is pictured next to his abkhaz counterpart , sergei bagapsh , with the slogan " peace !
freedom !
independence ! "
russia and abkhazia - just like the two men in the poster - stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the moment .
security questions not everyone is as enthusiastic about russia 's role .
sergei sharagov runs a real estate agency in sukhumi .
we meet in a newly refurbished restaurant , for which he says he negotiated the initial contract .
it is a glitzy place with high-backed white chairs and sparkling chandeliers .
mr sharagov says he has just signed new deals for hotels and an entertainment complex , but he says many investors - especially those in the west - are afraid of putting money into a territory which they do not see as independent .
after all , abkhazia is still a disputed territory .
" i would not say that investors came here quickly .
some are afraid , of course .
many question the security of a deal with this republic .
contracts need to be more watertight before people can feel confident . "
he also says few abkhaz businessmen can afford to compete for the size of contracts available to external investors .
" the olympics -lsb- in sochi -rsb- have pushed up the prices here , meaning many locals are squeezed out of the market .
nevertheless there is more cash now and we should remember that not everything here is tied to the games . "
the restaurant we are in is strangely quiet even at dinner time , but mr sharagov is still hopeful that clients will soon arrive .
" this is just the beginning , " he says .
new wealth walking along sukhumi 's sub-tropical black sea promenade you get the sense that tourists could one day flock here - just as they did during the soviet era . "
we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place " anna yaylian vines straddle the iron balconies of the turreted seaside palaces .
in the surrounding hills mandarins dangle jewel-like from the trees .
my visit coincided with the opening of the city 's newest coastal attraction - the black sea bowling arcade .
it too has been built with the help of russian funds .
when there are so many war-damaged buildings around and an unbalanced economy across the region , bowling might not seem a priority .
but its manager , daour eshba , disagrees .
" of course it was difficult after the war -lsb- in 1992-3 -rsb- , but it was long ago and we have to forget about it .
we have to begin a new life , with entertainment , to be happy .
we have to laugh every day and play every day . "
inside the arcade young abkhazians get to grips with the multi-coloured bowling balls and the shiny , new equipment .
anna yaylian , 21 , is bowling for the first time .
she says it is a positive development .
" i was born in this city and i want it to be famous all around the world .
as you can see it begins : we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place . "
a man in his twenties who did not want to give his name agreed .
" of course politics is always involved .
but today it is about friendship .
i can say that it is friendship , because russian people come here and we like that .
i say they have big hearts . "
there 's no doubting his strong sense of pride in abkhazia 's new wealth .
that pride is shared by many others in sukhumi .
georgia and the west may have - so far - chosen to ignore abkhazia 's declaration of independence , but the feeling of national identity here is tangible .

freedom !
independence ! "
by tom esslemont bbc news , sukhumi from the bridge over abkhazia 's second largest river the four bright yellow diggers ploughing through the water may look like nothing unusual .
in fact , they are the biggest indication yet of russia 's long-term plans to invest heavily in abkhazia .
the gravel they are extracting from the kodori river bed is destined for the russian city of sochi , further north along the black sea coast , for use in one of its most important building projects in the next decade , the 2014 winter olympics .
russia backed abkhazia 's declaration of independence in august 2008 and is the territory 's most prominent supporter .
the two agreed to co-operate long before georgia 's august war with russia .
russian money now redevelopment is going ahead on a grand scale , despite georgia 's assertion that abkhazia is still legally one of its territories .
thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically kristina ozgan , abkhazia 's finance minister in the capital , sukhumi , new restaurants , hotels and entertainment attractions line the black sea promenade .
many have been renovated with russian money .
this new wave of investment marks a welcome change for a tiny seaside territory where war is never far from the memory .
houses , government buildings and palaces still lie in ruins after the war for independence against georgia in the early 1990s .
a subsequent economic blockade by georgia froze development plans .
abkhazia 's finance minister , kristina ozgan , welcomes the recent change .
anyone , not just russia , should feel welcome to invest in abkhazia , she says .
" you have to understand , abkhazia does not select which business comes here , it invites business .
other countries do n't want to work here without guarantees , but russia does . "
she refuses to name a figure , but suggests russian investment amounts to more than £ 68m -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- this year alone .
" thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically , " she tells me .
outside , i notice a large roadside billboard poster in which russian president dmitry medvedev is pictured next to his abkhaz counterpart , sergei bagapsh , with the slogan " peace !
freedom !
independence ! "
russia and abkhazia - just like the two men in the poster - stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the moment .
security questions not everyone is as enthusiastic about russia 's role .
sergei sharagov runs a real estate agency in sukhumi .
we meet in a newly refurbished restaurant , for which he says he negotiated the initial contract .
it is a glitzy place with high-backed white chairs and sparkling chandeliers .
gravel from the kodori river bed is destined for the russian city of sochi mr sharagov says he has just signed new deals for hotels and an entertainment complex , but he says many investors - especially those in the west - are afraid of putting money into a territory which they do not see as independent .
after all , abkhazia is still a disputed territory .
" i would not say that investors came here quickly .
some are afraid , of course .
many question the security of a deal with this republic .
contracts need to be more watertight before people can feel confident . "
he also says few abkhaz businessmen can afford to compete for the size of contracts available to external investors .
" the olympics -lsb- in sochi -rsb- have pushed up the prices here , meaning many locals are squeezed out of the market .
nevertheless there is more cash now and we should remember that not everything here is tied to the games . "
the restaurant we are in is strangely quiet even at dinner time , but mr sharagov is still hopeful that clients will soon arrive .
" this is just the beginning , " he says .
new wealth walking along sukhumi 's sub-tropical black sea promenade you get the sense that tourists could one day flock here - just as they did during the soviet era .
we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place anna yaylian vines straddle the iron balconies of the turreted seaside palaces .
in the surrounding hills mandarins dangle jewel-like from the trees .

by tom esslemont bbc news , sukhumi from the bridge over abkhazia 's second largest river the four bright yellow diggers ploughing through the water may look like nothing unusual .
in fact , they are the biggest indication yet of russia 's long-term plans to invest heavily in abkhazia .
the gravel they are extracting from the kodori river bed is destined for the russian city of sochi , further north along the black sea coast , for use in one of its most important building projects in the next decade , the 2014 winter olympics .
russia backed abkhazia 's declaration of independence in august 2008 and is the territory 's most prominent supporter .
the two agreed to co-operate long before georgia 's august war with russia .
russian money now redevelopment is going ahead on a grand scale , despite georgia 's assertion that abkhazia is still legally one of its territories .
thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically kristina ozgan , abkhazia 's finance minister in the capital , sukhumi , new restaurants , hotels and entertainment attractions line the black sea promenade .
many have been renovated with russian money .
this new wave of investment marks a welcome change for a tiny seaside territory where war is never far from the memory .
houses , government buildings and palaces still lie in ruins after the war for independence against georgia in the early 1990s .
a subsequent economic blockade by georgia froze development plans .
abkhazia 's finance minister , kristina ozgan , welcomes the recent change .
anyone , not just russia , should feel welcome to invest in abkhazia , she says .
" you have to understand , abkhazia does not select which business comes here , it invites business .
other countries do n't want to work here without guarantees , but russia does . "
she refuses to name a figure , but suggests russian investment amounts to more than £ 68m -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- this year alone .
" thanks to russia , we can feel safe economically , " she tells me .
outside , i notice a large roadside billboard poster in which russian president dmitry medvedev is pictured next to his abkhaz counterpart , sergei bagapsh , with the slogan " peace !
freedom !
independence ! "
russia and abkhazia - just like the two men in the poster - stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the moment .
security questions not everyone is as enthusiastic about russia 's role .
sergei sharagov runs a real estate agency in sukhumi .
we meet in a newly refurbished restaurant , for which he says he negotiated the initial contract .
it is a glitzy place with high-backed white chairs and sparkling chandeliers .
gravel from the kodori river bed is destined for the russian city of sochi mr sharagov says he has just signed new deals for hotels and an entertainment complex , but he says many investors - especially those in the west - are afraid of putting money into a territory which they do not see as independent .
after all , abkhazia is still a disputed territory .
" i would not say that investors came here quickly .
some are afraid , of course .
many question the security of a deal with this republic .
contracts need to be more watertight before people can feel confident . "
he also says few abkhaz businessmen can afford to compete for the size of contracts available to external investors .
" the olympics -lsb- in sochi -rsb- have pushed up the prices here , meaning many locals are squeezed out of the market .
nevertheless there is more cash now and we should remember that not everything here is tied to the games . "
the restaurant we are in is strangely quiet even at dinner time , but mr sharagov is still hopeful that clients will soon arrive .
" this is just the beginning , " he says .
new wealth walking along sukhumi 's sub-tropical black sea promenade you get the sense that tourists could one day flock here - just as they did during the soviet era .
we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place anna yaylian vines straddle the iron balconies of the turreted seaside palaces .
in the surrounding hills mandarins dangle jewel-like from the trees .
my visit coincided with the opening of the city 's newest coastal attraction - the black sea bowling arcade .
it too has been built with the help of russian funds .
when there are so many war-damaged buildings around and an unbalanced economy across the region , bowling might not seem a priority .
but its manager , daour eshba , disagrees .
" of course it was difficult after the war -lsb- in 1992-3 -rsb- , but it was long ago and we have to forget about it .
we have to begin a new life , with entertainment , to be happy .
we have to laugh every day and play every day . "
inside the arcade young abkhazians get to grips with the multi-coloured bowling balls and the shiny , new equipment .
anna yaylian , 21 , is bowling for the first time .
she says it is a positive development .
" i was born in this city and i want it to be famous all around the world .
as you can see it begins : we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place . "
a man in his twenties who did not want to give his name agreed .
" of course politics is always involved .
but today it is about friendship .
i can say that it is friendship , because russian people come here and we like that .
i say they have big hearts . "
there 's no doubting his strong sense of pride in abkhazia 's new wealth .
that pride is shared by many others in sukhumi .
georgia and the west may have - so far - chosen to ignore abkhazia 's declaration of independence , but the feeling of national identity here is tangible .

it too has been built with the help of russian funds .
when there are so many war-damaged buildings around and an unbalanced economy across the region , bowling might not seem a priority .
but its manager , daour eshba , disagrees .
" of course it was difficult after the war -lsb- in 1992-3 -rsb- , but it was long ago and we have to forget about it .
we have to begin a new life , with entertainment , to be happy .
we have to laugh every day and play every day . "
inside the arcade young abkhazians get to grips with the multi-coloured bowling balls and the shiny , new equipment .
anna yaylian , 21 , is bowling for the first time .
she says it is a positive development .
" i was born in this city and i want it to be famous all around the world .
as you can see it begins : we have opened a brand new bowling centre - the first of its kind .
i 'm sure such places like this will help to make sukhumi a better place . "
a man in his twenties who did not want to give his name agreed .
" of course politics is always involved .
but today it is about friendship .
i can say that it is friendship , because russian people come here and we like that .
i say they have big hearts . "
there 's no doubting his strong sense of pride in abkhazia 's new wealth .
that pride is shared by many others in sukhumi .
georgia and the west may have - so far - chosen to ignore abkhazia 's declaration of independence , but the feeling of national identity here is tangible .

blind and sighted athletes made the same expressions when they won and lost , us researchers found .
this , the study reported in the journal of personality and social psychology study suggests , meant the expressions were not picked up by watching others .
the researchers believe they could be remnants of evolutionary history . "
it could be that our emotions , and the systems to regulate them , are vestiges of our evolutionary history " professor david matsumoto san francisco state university the idea that facial expressions are in-built is not new - scientists have suggested it since the 1960s .
however , the study at san francisco state university provides some of the strongest evidence yet to support it .
professor david matsumoto and his team compared 4,800 photographs , capturing the expressions of sighted and blind judo athletes at medal ceremonies at the 2004 olympic and paralympic games .
in each case , the faces of gold and silver medal winning athletes were scrutinised .
while the winners frequently showed genuine joy at their victory , those in the lesser medal positions often produced " social smiles " - smiles involving only mouth movement , indicating that they may be artificial rather than spontaneous .
no biting the researchers concluded that sighted and blind competitors showed or controlled their expressions in exactly the same way .
professor matsumoto said : " the statistical correlation between the facial expressions of sighted and blind individuals was almost perfect .
" this suggests something genetically resident within us is the source of facial expressions of emotion .
" losers pushed their lower lip up as if to control the emotion on their face and many produced social smiles - individuals blind from birth could not have learned to control their emotions in this way through visual learning , so there must be another mechanism .
" it could be that our emotions , and the systems to regulate them , are vestiges of our evolutionary history . "
he said that humans might have learned that rather than express negative emotions by yelling , biting or throwing insults , they may have developed a system that automatically closes the mouth to prevent it .
dr bridget waller , from the university of portsmouth , said that primates often used a " bare teeth display " to signal to other primates that they were not going to attack them , and humans might have inherited a similar system .
" it is a way of signalling your benign intent .
it may not be so much that you are stopping yourself from doing something , but actually demonstrating to somebody else that you are not going to do it .
she warned : " people can think that all communication revolves around language , when it happens on so many other levels , such as body language and facial expression . "

processed foods including meat , cheese , and drink contain inorganic phosphates .
researchers fed mice with lung cancer a diet with similar percentages of phosphates to those in human food , and found tumour growth accelerated .
but uk experts stressed the findings reported in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine may not be repeated in humans .
phosphates are an essential nutrient for living organisms , and adding phosphates to food can improve its texture and ability to retain water .
but the study suggested that high levels of inorganic phosphates may be interfering with the body 's cell signalling systems .
whilst this may be a relevant observation it has never been assessed in man professor stephen spiro british lung foundation the researchers , from seoul national university , studied mice bred to automatically develop lung tumours .
the animals were given a diet of either 0.5 % or 1 % phosphate , which the scientists suggested represented the levels in modern human diets .
signalling pathways after four weeks , lung tissue was analysed .
tumours from the 1 % phosphate mice had grown faster .
dr myung-haing cho , who led the study , said : " lung cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell proliferation in lung tissue , and disruption of signalling pathways in those tissues can confer a normal cell with malignant properties .
" this study demonstrates that high intake of inorganic phosphates may strongly stimulate lung cancer development by altering those signalling pathways . "
he said that phosphate levels in modern diets had risen even in recent years , perhaps reaching 1000mg a day in some cases .
" the average diet today is actually closer to the 1 % diet and may actually exceed it , " he said .
never assessed however , professor stephen spiro , the deputy chairman of the british lung foundation , said that the case was far from being proven .
" whilst this may be a relevant observation it has never been assessed in man , and any recent increase in high phosphate ingestion due to excessive phosphates in processed foodstuffs would be likely to take many years before they could affect tumour development in humans .
" this study does suggest that it may be worth while assessing phosphate ingestion in the modern diet ; however , further study would be required to ascertain any link in humans . "
a spokesman for the food standards agency confirmed that phosphates were legally used in uk foods , but said it had not yet had the chance to assess the study .

he said that phosphate levels in modern diets had risen even in recent years , perhaps reaching 1000mg a day in some cases .
" the average diet today is actually closer to the 1 % diet and may actually exceed it , " he said .
never assessed however , professor stephen spiro , the deputy chairman of the british lung foundation , said that the case was far from being proven .
" whilst this may be a relevant observation it has never been assessed in man , and any recent increase in high phosphate ingestion due to excessive phosphates in processed foodstuffs would be likely to take many years before they could affect tumour development in humans .
" this study does suggest that it may be worth while assessing phosphate ingestion in the modern diet ; however , further study would be required to ascertain any link in humans . "
a spokesman for the food standards agency confirmed that phosphates were legally used in uk foods , but said it had not yet had the chance to assess the study .

bbc northern ireland home affairs correspondent vincent kearney looks back .
the police entered 2008 with judicial criticism ringing in their ears , thinking that things could surely only get better .
just days before christmas last year , south armagh man sean hoey was acquitted of involvement in the omagh bombing , the largest single atrocity of the troubles , after 56 days of evidence from 500 witnesses and a trial that cost millions of pounds .
it ended with unprecedented criticism of the investigation by the trial judge , who described the attitude of the police as " seemingly thoughtless and slapdash " .
when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart jury out on police performance sir hugh orde , the chief constable , rejected that criticism but conceded that it was highly unlikely that anyone would ever be convicted of the murders of the 29 people who died in the bombing .
the police , who viewed the criticism as unjust , have secured many convictions for a range of crimes since mr justice weir delivered his damning verdict .
but when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart .
both crimes had been blamed on the ira and , at the time , had huge political implications .
but both ended with no convictions .
' flawed ' in june this year , at the end of the trial of three men charged in connection with the murder of the father-of-two outside a belfast pub in january 2005 , the judge said evidence from three prosecution witnesses , including a woman who claimed to have witnessed the attack , was flawed .
listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision catherine mccartney spotlight on mccartney trial he said the evidence from one of the witnesses was " bordering on fantasy " .
the verdict was no surprise for mr mccartney 's family .
" we 're very disappointed at the judgement , but not surprised by it , we did n't have very high expectations , " said catherine mccartney .
" listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision .
i believe that his conclusions were correct , given the evidence that was put before him . "
serious questions just like in the aftermath of the acquittal of sean hoey , serious questions were asked - if the evidence was so flawed , why did the police and the prosecution service bring the case to court ?
both agencies strongly defended their decisions .
there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted niall murphy chris ward 's solicitor bank robbery trial collapses ira was blamed for raid four months later , similar questions were again being asked after the collapse of the trial of west belfast man chris ward , who was charged with the theft of £ 26.5m from the northern bank just days before christmas in 2004 .
at the time , it was the biggest cash robbery in british criminal history and one of the largest anywhere in the world .
the police said they had no doubt that the robbery was the work of the ira , and claimed that mr ward , who worked as a supervisor at the bank , was part of the gang .
but mr ward said he was a victim who had taken part in the robbery under duress because his family was being held hostage .
circumstantial evidence the prosecution had admitted at the start of the trial that the case against chris ward was built on purely circumstantial evidence .
four weeks later , in october , the trial collapsed dramatically when the prosecution announced that it would be offering no further evidence .
the prosecution said it would offer no more evidence against chris ward the judge then said there was no evidence to support the charges against chris ward and acquitted him .
afterwards , mr ward 's solicitor niall murphy referred to the other failed high-profile cases when he spoke outside the court .
" there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted , " he said .
" the psni investigation into this case , possibly the largest ever in the uk , was not conditioned by the evidence , but was inspired by political motives . "
once again , the police and the public prosecution service , which made the decision to take the case to court , rejected the criticism .
individually , each of the cases was an embarrassment for the police and the prosecution authorities .
taken together , they raised serious questions about the investigative skills of the police , and the decision making of the pps .
both agencies will hope to avoid similar questions in the year ahead .

bbc northern ireland home affairs correspondent vincent kearney looks back .
the police entered 2008 with judicial criticism ringing in their ears , thinking that things could surely only get better .
just days before christmas last year , south armagh man sean hoey was acquitted of involvement in the omagh bombing , the largest single atrocity of the troubles , after 56 days of evidence from 500 witnesses and a trial that cost millions of pounds .
it ended with unprecedented criticism of the investigation by the trial judge , who described the attitude of the police as " seemingly thoughtless and slapdash " .
when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart jury out on police performance sir hugh orde , the chief constable , rejected that criticism but conceded that it was highly unlikely that anyone would ever be convicted of the murders of the 29 people who died in the bombing .
the police , who viewed the criticism as unjust , have secured many convictions for a range of crimes since mr justice weir delivered his damning verdict .
but when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart .
both crimes had been blamed on the ira and , at the time , had huge political implications .
but both ended with no convictions .
' flawed ' in june this year , at the end of the trial of three men charged in connection with the murder of the father-of-two outside a belfast pub in january 2005 , the judge said evidence from three prosecution witnesses , including a woman who claimed to have witnessed the attack , was flawed .
listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision catherine mccartney spotlight on mccartney trial he said the evidence from one of the witnesses was " bordering on fantasy " .
the verdict was no surprise for mr mccartney 's family .
" we 're very disappointed at the judgement , but not surprised by it , we did n't have very high expectations , " said catherine mccartney .
" listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision .
i believe that his conclusions were correct , given the evidence that was put before him . "
serious questions just like in the aftermath of the acquittal of sean hoey , serious questions were asked - if the evidence was so flawed , why did the police and the prosecution service bring the case to court ?
both agencies strongly defended their decisions .
there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted niall murphy chris ward 's solicitor bank robbery trial collapses ira was blamed for raid four months later , similar questions were again being asked after the collapse of the trial of west belfast man chris ward , who was charged with the theft of £ 26.5m from the northern bank just days before christmas in 2004 .
at the time , it was the biggest cash robbery in british criminal history and one of the largest anywhere in the world .
the police said they had no doubt that the robbery was the work of the ira , and claimed that mr ward , who worked as a supervisor at the bank , was part of the gang .
but mr ward said he was a victim who had taken part in the robbery under duress because his family was being held hostage .
circumstantial evidence the prosecution had admitted at the start of the trial that the case against chris ward was built on purely circumstantial evidence .
four weeks later , in october , the trial collapsed dramatically when the prosecution announced that it would be offering no further evidence .
the prosecution said it would offer no more evidence against chris ward the judge then said there was no evidence to support the charges against chris ward and acquitted him .
afterwards , mr ward 's solicitor niall murphy referred to the other failed high-profile cases when he spoke outside the court .
" there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted , " he said .
" the psni investigation into this case , possibly the largest ever in the uk , was not conditioned by the evidence , but was inspired by political motives . "
once again , the police and the public prosecution service , which made the decision to take the case to court , rejected the criticism .
individually , each of the cases was an embarrassment for the police and the prosecution authorities .
taken together , they raised serious questions about the investigative skills of the police , and the decision making of the pps .
both agencies will hope to avoid similar questions in the year ahead .

bbc northern ireland home affairs correspondent vincent kearney looks back .
the police entered 2008 with judicial criticism ringing in their ears , thinking that things could surely only get better .
just days before christmas last year , south armagh man sean hoey was acquitted of involvement in the omagh bombing , the largest single atrocity of the troubles , after 56 days of evidence from 500 witnesses and a trial that cost millions of pounds .
it ended with unprecedented criticism of the investigation by the trial judge , who described the attitude of the police as " seemingly thoughtless and slapdash " .
when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart jury out on police performance sir hugh orde , the chief constable , rejected that criticism but conceded that it was highly unlikely that anyone would ever be convicted of the murders of the 29 people who died in the bombing .
the police , who viewed the criticism as unjust , have secured many convictions for a range of crimes since mr justice weir delivered his damning verdict .
but when it came to two equally high-profile cases , the murder of belfast man robert mccartney and the northern bank robbery , the police again faced criticism after they fell apart .
both crimes had been blamed on the ira and , at the time , had huge political implications .
but both ended with no convictions .
' flawed ' in june this year , at the end of the trial of three men charged in connection with the murder of the father-of-two outside a belfast pub in january 2005 , the judge said evidence from three prosecution witnesses , including a woman who claimed to have witnessed the attack , was flawed .
listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision catherine mccartney spotlight on mccartney trial he said the evidence from one of the witnesses was " bordering on fantasy " .
the verdict was no surprise for mr mccartney 's family .
" we 're very disappointed at the judgement , but not surprised by it , we did n't have very high expectations , " said catherine mccartney .
" listening to the evidence that was put before the judge , i believe that he made the right decision .
i believe that his conclusions were correct , given the evidence that was put before him . "
serious questions just like in the aftermath of the acquittal of sean hoey , serious questions were asked - if the evidence was so flawed , why did the police and the prosecution service bring the case to court ?
both agencies strongly defended their decisions .
there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted niall murphy chris ward 's solicitor bank robbery trial collapses ira was blamed for raid four months later , similar questions were again being asked after the collapse of the trial of west belfast man chris ward , who was charged with the theft of £ 26.5m from the northern bank just days before christmas in 2004 .
at the time , it was the biggest cash robbery in british criminal history and one of the largest anywhere in the world .
the police said they had no doubt that the robbery was the work of the ira , and claimed that mr ward , who worked as a supervisor at the bank , was part of the gang .
but mr ward said he was a victim who had taken part in the robbery under duress because his family was being held hostage .
circumstantial evidence the prosecution had admitted at the start of the trial that the case against chris ward was built on purely circumstantial evidence .
four weeks later , in october , the trial collapsed dramatically when the prosecution announced that it would be offering no further evidence .
the prosecution said it would offer no more evidence against chris ward the judge then said there was no evidence to support the charges against chris ward and acquitted him .
afterwards , mr ward 's solicitor niall murphy referred to the other failed high-profile cases when he spoke outside the court .
" there must be root and branch analysis of how some high-profile criminal cases are prosecuted , " he said .
" the psni investigation into this case , possibly the largest ever in the uk , was not conditioned by the evidence , but was inspired by political motives . "
once again , the police and the public prosecution service , which made the decision to take the case to court , rejected the criticism .
individually , each of the cases was an embarrassment for the police and the prosecution authorities .
taken together , they raised serious questions about the investigative skills of the police , and the decision making of the pps .
both agencies will hope to avoid similar questions in the year ahead .

neighbours turned against each other because of ethnic and political rivalries and the police were accused of using brutal force to quash clashes and protests .
but it was here that john okello and jane ogolla , both ethnic luos like then opposition leader raila odinga , sought refuge after they were orphaned during violence in other parts of the country .
fourteen-year-old john says he walked more than 62 miles -lrb- 100km -rrb- to nairobi from naivasha after his parents were shot and killed .
" i did n't know where i was going but luckily through god 's grace i finally arrived in nairobi , " he says .
" i do n't remember how i walked but it was many days . "
seeking refuge he would walk all day and spend the night in forests , depending on the kindness of strangers for money to buy food .
some 1,500 people died in the clashes that erupted after the elections he ended up in kibera , although he had never been there before and made his way to a local government office to ask for assistance .
rioting erupted after president mwai kibaki was declared the winner of the presidential poll , triggering claims of electoral fraud mr odinga .
the rivals signed a power-sharing deal in february to bring an end to the violence and formed a coalition government - but not before 1,500 people died in clashes and another 300,000 fled their homes .
for 20-year-old jane , the journey to kibera was not as long or treacherous as john 's , but it was no less traumatic .
she had lived with her parents and five younger siblings in dandora , a slum on the outskirts of nairobi .
two people argued in a shop the other day and one was shouting very bitterly ' it 's a luo .
if we get another opportunity , they will see ' jane onyango fear stalks kenyans one year on clashes broke out in dandora soon after the election results were announced on 29 december , and she says different gangs , including the infamous mungiki , and the paramilitary general service unit were involved in the attacks .
" we were at home and we had locked the door .
but the attackers came and my mother and father were killed as they tried to defend me and my siblings , " she says .
their house was burnt down and with no-one to turn to , the orphaned children left dandora .
they lived in a government camp for a month before they left for kawangware , another slum area outside nairobi , after hearing that the local mp was giving assistance to those affected by the violence .
the bloodiest clashes in kibera were between the kikuyu and luo but they were forced to leave kawangware after being warned that it was not safe there and headed for kibera .
jane and john are now living at the st michael 's holy unity academy , which was established in 1994 to assist orphans in kibera .
brought together by fate , the two are slowly rebuilding their lives in their new home .
but one year later , the place where they found refuge is still very divided .
simmering the bloodiest clashes in kibera were between members of president kibaki 's kikuyu community and prime minister odinga 's luo community .
today , ethnic tensions between the two communities are still simmering just below the surface of daily life .
memories of the violence has kept tension simmering in the community " people are just assuming things are okay .
if you want to talk you still watch your back , " says jane onyango , a luo who lives in kibera .
mrs onyango , who does community work in the slum , says things are not back to normal .
" i 'm a luo and i really try to relate to everybody because of the community work i do , but you do n't just talk freely , " she adds .
" there 's that margin that has been drawn that is very hard to erase . "
she heads a community organisation called kibera women for peace and fairness , which was formed during the post-election violence to condemn police brutality .
when the organisation was formed , people from different ethnic communities came together to support the cause , but cracks later began to emerge among the group 's members .
" the luos and the kikuyus dropped off , " says mrs onyango .
" we have only two kikuyus and four luos among 384 members .
luos and kikuyus still have that problem relating . "
although most of those who were displaced have gone back to their homes and are living together , there is still tension between different communities .
" i went to a shop the other day and two people argued .
one was shouting very bitterly ' it 's a luo , ' and saying ' if we get another opportunity , they will see ' , " she says .
fuelling resentment statements to demean other communities are still spoken loudly in public places such as public service vehicles , and mrs onyango fears this could spark new violence .
" if something happens , i think it can be worse .
things are not safe , especially between the luos and kikuyus . "
a recent exercise to distribute relief food in the slum led to a confrontation with one community complaining that the other was being favoured .
resentment is said to remain high in a place which is already a tinderbox " there 's no peace .
there is calm , " mrs onyango observes .
some of this tension is being fuelled by the government , which the community worker accuses of treating the two communities differently .
" the government is treating people very , very differently according to ethnic communities .
this unequal distribution of resources , it has brought problems before , " she says .
there have been no efforts to organise platforms where the two communities can sit together and resolve their differences , and she says the buck stops with the political leaders .
this has created a general feeling that the government is concentrating on helping those displaced from the rift valley province , and not doing enough to help those affected in other parts of the country .
all this is fuelling resentment in a place which is already a tinderbox .
" people are feeling bad and they have no voices to speak and nowhere to air their views .
" but the truth is people are not happy and because they ca n't reach the decision-makers , they turn on the wrong people who are also innocent , " mrs onyango says .
one year on from the elections , politicians have gone back to squabbling over power and forgotten their promise to heal the country 's ethnic divide , an atmosphere of fear is slowly spreading in kibera .

the bloodiest clashes in kibera were between the kikuyu and luo but they were forced to leave kawangware after being warned that it was not safe there and headed for kibera .
jane and john are now living at the st michael 's holy unity academy , which was established in 1994 to assist orphans in kibera .
brought together by fate , the two are slowly rebuilding their lives in their new home .
but one year later , the place where they found refuge is still very divided .
simmering the bloodiest clashes in kibera were between members of president kibaki 's kikuyu community and prime minister odinga 's luo community .
today , ethnic tensions between the two communities are still simmering just below the surface of daily life .
memories of the violence has kept tension simmering in the community " people are just assuming things are okay .
if you want to talk you still watch your back , " says jane onyango , a luo who lives in kibera .
mrs onyango , who does community work in the slum , says things are not back to normal .
" i 'm a luo and i really try to relate to everybody because of the community work i do , but you do n't just talk freely , " she adds .
" there 's that margin that has been drawn that is very hard to erase . "
she heads a community organisation called kibera women for peace and fairness , which was formed during the post-election violence to condemn police brutality .
when the organisation was formed , people from different ethnic communities came together to support the cause , but cracks later began to emerge among the group 's members .
" the luos and the kikuyus dropped off , " says mrs onyango .
" we have only two kikuyus and four luos among 384 members .
luos and kikuyus still have that problem relating . "
although most of those who were displaced have gone back to their homes and are living together , there is still tension between different communities .
" i went to a shop the other day and two people argued .
one was shouting very bitterly ' it 's a luo , ' and saying ' if we get another opportunity , they will see ' , " she says .
fuelling resentment statements to demean other communities are still spoken loudly in public places such as public service vehicles , and mrs onyango fears this could spark new violence .
" if something happens , i think it can be worse .
things are not safe , especially between the luos and kikuyus . "
a recent exercise to distribute relief food in the slum led to a confrontation with one community complaining that the other was being favoured .
resentment is said to remain high in a place which is already a tinderbox " there 's no peace .
there is calm , " mrs onyango observes .
some of this tension is being fuelled by the government , which the community worker accuses of treating the two communities differently .
" the government is treating people very , very differently according to ethnic communities .
this unequal distribution of resources , it has brought problems before , " she says .
there have been no efforts to organise platforms where the two communities can sit together and resolve their differences , and she says the buck stops with the political leaders .
this has created a general feeling that the government is concentrating on helping those displaced from the rift valley province , and not doing enough to help those affected in other parts of the country .
all this is fuelling resentment in a place which is already a tinderbox .
" people are feeling bad and they have no voices to speak and nowhere to air their views .
" but the truth is people are not happy and because they ca n't reach the decision-makers , they turn on the wrong people who are also innocent , " mrs onyango says .
one year on from the elections , politicians have gone back to squabbling over power and forgotten their promise to heal the country 's ethnic divide , an atmosphere of fear is slowly spreading in kibera .

neighbours turned against each other because of ethnic and political rivalries and the police were accused of using brutal force to quash clashes and protests .
but it was here that john okello and jane ogolla , both ethnic luos like then opposition leader raila odinga , sought refuge after they were orphaned during violence in other parts of the country .
fourteen-year-old john says he walked more than 62 miles -lrb- 100km -rrb- to nairobi from naivasha after his parents were shot and killed .
" i did n't know where i was going but luckily through god 's grace i finally arrived in nairobi , " he says .

seeking refuge he would walk all day and spend the night in forests , depending on the kindness of strangers for money to buy food .
some 1,500 people died in the clashes that erupted after the elections he ended up in kibera , although he had never been there before and made his way to a local government office to ask for assistance .
rioting erupted after president mwai kibaki was declared the winner of the presidential poll , triggering claims of electoral fraud mr odinga .
the rivals signed a power-sharing deal in february to bring an end to the violence and formed a coalition government - but not before 1,500 people died in clashes and another 300,000 fled their homes .

neighbours turned against each other because of ethnic and political rivalries and the police were accused of using brutal force to quash clashes and protests .
but it was here that john okello and jane ogolla , both ethnic luos like then opposition leader raila odinga , sought refuge after they were orphaned during violence in other parts of the country .
fourteen-year-old john says he walked more than 62 miles -lrb- 100km -rrb- to nairobi from naivasha after his parents were shot and killed .
" i did n't know where i was going but luckily through god 's grace i finally arrived in nairobi , " he says .
" i do n't remember how i walked but it was many days . "
seeking refuge he would walk all day and spend the night in forests , depending on the kindness of strangers for money to buy food .
he ended up in kibera , although he had never been there before and made his way to a local government office to ask for assistance .
rioting erupted after president mwai kibaki was declared the winner of the presidential poll , triggering claims of electoral fraud mr odinga .
the rivals signed a power-sharing deal in february to bring an end to the violence and formed a coalition government - but not before 1,500 people died in clashes and another 300,000 fled their homes .
for 20-year-old jane , the journey to kibera was not as long or treacherous as john 's , but it was no less traumatic .
she had lived with her parents and five younger siblings in dandora , a slum on the outskirts of nairobi . "
two people argued in a shop the other day and one was shouting very bitterly ' it 's a luo .
if we get another opportunity , they will see " ' jane onyango fear stalks kenyans one year on clashes broke out in dandora soon after the election results were announced on 29 december , and she says different gangs , including the infamous mungiki , and the paramilitary general service unit were involved in the attacks .
" we were at home and we had locked the door .
but the attackers came and my mother and father were killed as they tried to defend me and my siblings , " she says .
their house was burnt down and with no-one to turn to , the orphaned children left dandora .
they lived in a government camp for a month before they left for kawangware , another slum area outside nairobi , after hearing that the local mp was giving assistance to those affected by the violence .
but they were forced to leave kawangware after being warned that it was not safe there and headed for kibera .
jane and john are now living at the st michael 's holy unity academy , which was established in 1994 to assist orphans in kibera .
brought together by fate , the two are slowly rebuilding their lives in their new home .
but one year later , the place where they found refuge is still very divided .
simmering the bloodiest clashes in kibera were between members of president kibaki 's kikuyu community and prime minister odinga 's luo community .
today , ethnic tensions between the two communities are still simmering just below the surface of daily life .
" people are just assuming things are okay .
if you want to talk you still watch your back , " says jane onyango , a luo who lives in kibera .
mrs onyango , who does community work in the slum , says things are not back to normal .
" i 'm a luo and i really try to relate to everybody because of the community work i do , but you do n't just talk freely , " she adds .
" there 's that margin that has been drawn that is very hard to erase . "
she heads a community organisation called kibera women for peace and fairness , which was formed during the post-election violence to condemn police brutality .
when the organisation was formed , people from different ethnic communities came together to support the cause , but cracks later began to emerge among the group 's members .
" the luos and the kikuyus dropped off , " says mrs onyango .
" we have only two kikuyus and four luos among 384 members .
luos and kikuyus still have that problem relating . "
although most of those who were displaced have gone back to their homes and are living together , there is still tension between different communities .
" i went to a shop the other day and two people argued .
one was shouting very bitterly ' it 's a luo , ' and saying ' if we get another opportunity , they will see ' , " she says .
fuelling resentment statements to demean other communities are still spoken loudly in public places such as public service vehicles , and mrs onyango fears this could spark new violence .
" if something happens , i think it can be worse .
things are not safe , especially between the luos and kikuyus . "
a recent exercise to distribute relief food in the slum led to a confrontation with one community complaining that the other was being favoured .
" there 's no peace .
there is calm , " mrs onyango observes .
some of this tension is being fuelled by the government , which the community worker accuses of treating the two communities differently .
" the government is treating people very , very differently according to ethnic communities .
this unequal distribution of resources , it has brought problems before , " she says .
there have been no efforts to organise platforms where the two communities can sit together and resolve their differences , and she says the buck stops with the political leaders .
this has created a general feeling that the government is concentrating on helping those displaced from the rift valley province , and not doing enough to help those affected in other parts of the country .
all this is fuelling resentment in a place which is already a tinderbox .
" people are feeling bad and they have no voices to speak and nowhere to air their views .
" but the truth is people are not happy and because they ca n't reach the decision-makers , they turn on the wrong people who are also innocent , " mrs onyango says .
one year on from the elections , politicians have gone back to squabbling over power and forgotten their promise to heal the country 's ethnic divide , an atmosphere of fear is slowly spreading in kibera .
