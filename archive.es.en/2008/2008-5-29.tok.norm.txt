" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .
this would be the carrier for both us and international consignments .
the restructuring is expected to cost $ 2 billion .
under the deal , the company will pay ups $ 1 billion a year for 10 years to carry its us domestic and international shipments within north america .

dhl 's us operations have posted unspecified losses since it entered the market in 2004 against stiff competition from rivals ups and fedex .
the restructuring plan foresees cutting losses to $ 800 to $ 900 million by 2009 and less than $ 500 million by 2010 .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de over 100 states agree on landmark cluster bomb ban more than 100 governments have agreed on a draft convention to ban cluster bombs , which have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians .
but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us .

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de over 100 states agree on landmark cluster bomb ban more than 100 governments have agreed on a draft convention to ban cluster bombs , which have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 29.05.2008 france 's club med plan riddled with problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precursor mediterranean union had attracted protests president nicolas sarkozy 's controversial plan for a mediterranean union , expected to be a cornerstone of france 's looming eu presidency , is in trouble with experts saying many questions still need to be resolved . last year french president nicolas sarkozy had a vision for an exclusive “ club med , ” in which membership was based solely on a shared mediterranean coastline .
this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?
they ’ d surely want to focus on eastern europe .
the mediterranean union is sarkozy ’ s baby , but not everyone else ’ s , ” o ' donnell added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 29.05.2008 france 's club med plan riddled with problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precursor mediterranean union had attracted protests president nicolas sarkozy 's controversial plan for a mediterranean union , expected to be a cornerstone of france 's looming eu presidency , is in trouble with experts saying many questions still need to be resolved . last year french president nicolas sarkozy had a vision for an exclusive “ club med , ” in which membership was based solely on a shared mediterranean coastline .
this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?
they ’ d surely want to focus on eastern europe .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?
they ’ d surely want to focus on eastern europe .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .

wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '

" we neglect this vast intellectual heritage . "
peter nickl , a philosophy lecturer at hanover university who devised the festival , has chosen popular themes such as soccer -lrb- lecture : physical activity and psychic turmoil -rrb- and depression -lrb- the ill soul -rrb- , as well as the classics -lrb- leibniz 's concept of mind -rrb- .

the philosopher is better known among literate non-germans than among his own countrymen , festival organizers say .
hanover university was formally named leibniz university after him , but many germans only associate the name with the popular leibniz brand of cookies .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '
laying claim to intellectual heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kant 's " critique of pure reason " is a philosophy course standard the country that produced such giants of western philosophy as kant and hegel has largely turned its back on philosophy , asserts nida-ruemelin , who teaches in munich ..
" yet german-language philosophy is so important in the rest of the world that you find a lot of italians especially learning german just so that they can read works by martin heidegger in the original , " he said .
" we neglect this vast intellectual heritage . "
peter nickl , a philosophy lecturer at hanover university who devised the festival , has chosen popular themes such as soccer -lrb- lecture : physical activity and psychic turmoil -rrb- and depression -lrb- the ill soul -rrb- , as well as the classics -lrb- leibniz 's concept of mind -rrb- .
hanover profiles a famous son the hanover city council , which is hosting the festival in partnership with the university philosophy department , aims to remind locals about one of the city 's greatest sons , gottfried wilhelm leibniz -lrb- 1646-1716 -rrb- .
the philosopher is better known among literate non-germans than among his own countrymen , festival organizers say .
hanover university was formally named leibniz university after him , but many germans only associate the name with the popular leibniz brand of cookies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel may be germany 's best-known philosopher top speakers booked for the festival include the catholic ethicist robert spaemann , 81 , and franco volpi , one of italy 's top contemporary philosophers .
a variety of venues planned " we want to overcome prejudices and prove how useful philosophy really is , " said nickl .
events are planned on a main city square , in cafes , gardens , churches and museums .
there will be an art show , concerts and theater performance , and a gourmet dinner , " at the table with the great thinkers , " in a hanover restaurant . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .

among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .

dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.05.2008 gujjar agitation spreads in india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gujjars burn effigies during a stir in new delhi life in indian capital new delhi came to a virtual standstill on thursday , when members of the ethnic gujjar community held demonstrations .
the gujjars have been demanding more opportunities to qualify for government jobs as well as quotas in educational institutions .
the protests , which started a few days ago , turned violent last week , claiming 37 lives . the gujjars are an ethnic tribe , traditionally shepherds , who comprise more than 50 million of the population .
for the most part , they live across india ’ s northern and western states .
their protest started from rajasthan last week and has now spread to other regions . the gujjars are calling for more reserved quotas in the government ’ s affirmative action plan .
professor satish deshpande , a renowned sociologist from new delhi explains : “ the demand is born out of a feeling that reservations and quotas are the only effective way in which the community as a whole can be benefited or can progress . ”
the indian government ’ s affirmative action policy sets aside job and seats at educational insitutions for people from disadvantaged groups , also classified as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes .
the aim is to flatten centuries-old social hierarchies , which led to widespread discrimination in the past .
‘ scheduled caste status ’ the gujjars are largely categorised as a disadvantaged group , but they want to be reclassified downwards as a scheduled tribe , the status that some of their community members enjoy in the states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh .
they claim they are economically left out and downwards reclassification would help them get more benefits .
the issue is currently gridlocked with the state and central governments taking different positions .
the government in rajasthan , which is run by the bhartiya janata party , the main opposition group at the national level , has asked the gujjars to take their initiative to the central government . prime minister manmohan singh has however referred the case to the law ministry , asking it to examine the legality of the demand .
need for a change in attitudes professor deshpande explains , where , he thinks , the solution to the crisis lies : “ from a long term point of view , clearly reservation can not help .
it works only if we think of it as a special solution needed in specific cases .
in any case , the state is unable to provide anywhere near the number of jobs that are needed to take communities forward . ”
he believes a change in attitudes is vital , especially among upper caste people : “ in the short run , the biggest change is needed in the attitude of those , who oppose this without thinking where demands like these are coming from .
the opposition to reservation from the upper caste stems , in my opinion , from a very short- sighted and narrow-minded point of view , which doesn ’ t acknowledge the many benefits that upper caste status continue to bestow in independent india .
and those benefits remain invisible , whereas benefits explicitly linked to caste become very visible .
and it is because of this that we have a lot of tensions today . ”
so far the gujjar leaders have refused to call off their agitation .
they also say any negotiation with the government is only possible if they are assured of getting the special status which they demand . disha uppal 29/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 29.05.2008 deutsche telekom offices raided as spying scandal deepens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation of a spying scandal may tarnish deutsche telekom 's reputation a probe into a major spying scandal at deutsche telekom escalated on thursday with prosecutors raiding the company 's offices and launching investigations against two former bosses of europe 's biggest phone company . in a new twist to an escalating privacy scandal engulfing deutsche telekom , german prosecutors said on thursday , may 28 , they had opened investigations against two former bosses at the company and raided the offices of the beleaguered telecommunications giant , based in bonn .
" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?

there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?
they ’ d surely want to focus on eastern europe .
the mediterranean union is sarkozy ’ s baby , but not everyone else ’ s , ” o ' donnell added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .

the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .

he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .

both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .

schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both have denied involvement .

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .

dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 29.05.2008 deutsche telekom offices raided as spying scandal deepens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation of a spying scandal may tarnish deutsche telekom 's reputation a probe into a major spying scandal at deutsche telekom escalated on thursday with prosecutors raiding the company 's offices and launching investigations against two former bosses of europe 's biggest phone company . in a new twist to an escalating privacy scandal engulfing deutsche telekom , german prosecutors said on thursday , may 28 , they had opened investigations against two former bosses at the company and raided the offices of the beleaguered telecommunications giant , based in bonn .
" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .

he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .

" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .

under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .
this would be the carrier for both us and international consignments .
the restructuring is expected to cost $ 2 billion .
under the deal , the company will pay ups $ 1 billion a year for 10 years to carry its us domestic and international shipments within north america .

dhl 's yellow air freighters , which fly large volumes of mail around the us , are expected to vanish from us skies , but dhl vans and offices on the ground would continue as before .
dhl 's us operations have posted unspecified losses since it entered the market in 2004 against stiff competition from rivals ups and fedex .
the restructuring plan foresees cutting losses to $ 800 to $ 900 million by 2009 and less than $ 500 million by 2010 .

it added the restructuring plan would lead to 1,500 to 1,800 job cuts .

" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 29.05.2008 france 's club med plan riddled with problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precursor mediterranean union had attracted protests president nicolas sarkozy 's controversial plan for a mediterranean union , expected to be a cornerstone of france 's looming eu presidency , is in trouble with experts saying many questions still need to be resolved . last year french president nicolas sarkozy had a vision for an exclusive “ club med , ” in which membership was based solely on a shared mediterranean coastline .
this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .
this would be the carrier for both us and international consignments .
the restructuring is expected to cost $ 2 billion .
under the deal , the company will pay ups $ 1 billion a year for 10 years to carry its us domestic and international shipments within north america .
us business in trouble deutsche post , based in bonn , said it remained committed to serving us customers and that less than 4 percent of its shipments would be affected .
dhl 's yellow air freighters , which fly large volumes of mail around the us , are expected to vanish from us skies , but dhl vans and offices on the ground would continue as before .
dhl 's us operations have posted unspecified losses since it entered the market in 2004 against stiff competition from rivals ups and fedex .
the restructuring plan foresees cutting losses to $ 800 to $ 900 million by 2009 and less than $ 500 million by 2010 .
lay-offs ahead frank appel , the deutsche post chief executive , was optimistic that the deal with ups made economic sense and would help to secure dhl 's shaky position in the us market .
" we will significantly increase the profitability of the us express business .
we have no doubts that we will be successful , " appel said on wednesday .
deutsche post said the agreement with ups would also reduce ground infrastructure costs in north america .
it added the restructuring plan would lead to 1,500 to 1,800 job cuts .
dhl 's total us workforce amounts to 45,000 .
the job cuts will come as dhl consolidates logistics centers into larger units and reduces its pickup and delivery routes .
it will also scale back its ground network and reduce service to remote areas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .

a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .

" the departure is overdue , " said christian democrat thomas strobl .
" take the necessary consequences . " social democrat stephan hisberg , one of the founders of the east german spd , accused gysi and his left party of " lying and betraying . "
recurring allegations gysi , a lawyer , has been battling allegations he colluded with the east german secret police for years .
he responded to the attacks on the floor of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , with an impassioned speech .
he rejected the allegations , saying that politicians from other parties had for years used every means to try to damage him personally in order to harm his party . at issue this time is a 1979 meeting between gysi and two east german dissidents , one of which was his client robert havemann .
the head of the stasi archive , marianne birthler , had provoked the new debate with comments she made on ard television on wednesday , in which she alleged that documents in the archive 's possession concerning the meeting stemmed from an informer who could only be gysi . gysi took legal action against zdf television after it broadcast similar comments birthler made last week . at a left party convention last week , gysi rejected the accusations , saying he had never consciously or willingly cooperated with the stasi .
threat from the left ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine had called for birthler 's dismissal . " the boss of the stasi -lsb- archive -rsb- is not in the position to exercise her duties objectively and impartially , " he said . the left party was established by trade unionists and former social democrats a year ago .

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '
laying claim to intellectual heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kant 's " critique of pure reason " is a philosophy course standard the country that produced such giants of western philosophy as kant and hegel has largely turned its back on philosophy , asserts nida-ruemelin , who teaches in munich ..
" yet german-language philosophy is so important in the rest of the world that you find a lot of italians especially learning german just so that they can read works by martin heidegger in the original , " he said .
" we neglect this vast intellectual heritage . "
peter nickl , a philosophy lecturer at hanover university who devised the festival , has chosen popular themes such as soccer -lrb- lecture : physical activity and psychic turmoil -rrb- and depression -lrb- the ill soul -rrb- , as well as the classics -lrb- leibniz 's concept of mind -rrb- .
hanover profiles a famous son the hanover city council , which is hosting the festival in partnership with the university philosophy department , aims to remind locals about one of the city 's greatest sons , gottfried wilhelm leibniz -lrb- 1646-1716 -rrb- .
the philosopher is better known among literate non-germans than among his own countrymen , festival organizers say .
hanover university was formally named leibniz university after him , but many germans only associate the name with the popular leibniz brand of cookies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel may be germany 's best-known philosopher top speakers booked for the festival include the catholic ethicist robert spaemann , 81 , and franco volpi , one of italy 's top contemporary philosophers .
a variety of venues planned " we want to overcome prejudices and prove how useful philosophy really is , " said nickl .
events are planned on a main city square , in cafes , gardens , churches and museums .
there will be an art show , concerts and theater performance , and a gourmet dinner , " at the table with the great thinkers , " in a hanover restaurant . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .

wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .

the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .

the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '
laying claim to intellectual heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kant 's " critique of pure reason " is a philosophy course standard the country that produced such giants of western philosophy as kant and hegel has largely turned its back on philosophy , asserts nida-ruemelin , who teaches in munich ..
" yet german-language philosophy is so important in the rest of the world that you find a lot of italians especially learning german just so that they can read works by martin heidegger in the original , " he said .
" we neglect this vast intellectual heritage . "
peter nickl , a philosophy lecturer at hanover university who devised the festival , has chosen popular themes such as soccer -lrb- lecture : physical activity and psychic turmoil -rrb- and depression -lrb- the ill soul -rrb- , as well as the classics -lrb- leibniz 's concept of mind -rrb- .
hanover profiles a famous son the hanover city council , which is hosting the festival in partnership with the university philosophy department , aims to remind locals about one of the city 's greatest sons , gottfried wilhelm leibniz -lrb- 1646-1716 -rrb- .
the philosopher is better known among literate non-germans than among his own countrymen , festival organizers say .
hanover university was formally named leibniz university after him , but many germans only associate the name with the popular leibniz brand of cookies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel may be germany 's best-known philosopher top speakers booked for the festival include the catholic ethicist robert spaemann , 81 , and franco volpi , one of italy 's top contemporary philosophers .
a variety of venues planned " we want to overcome prejudices and prove how useful philosophy really is , " said nickl .
events are planned on a main city square , in cafes , gardens , churches and museums .
there will be an art show , concerts and theater performance , and a gourmet dinner , " at the table with the great thinkers , " in a hanover restaurant . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gujjars have been demanding more opportunities to qualify for government jobs as well as quotas in educational institutions .
the protests , which started a few days ago , turned violent last week , claiming 37 lives . the gujjars are an ethnic tribe , traditionally shepherds , who comprise more than 50 million of the population .
for the most part , they live across india ’ s northern and western states .
their protest started from rajasthan last week and has now spread to other regions . the gujjars are calling for more reserved quotas in the government ’ s affirmative action plan .
professor satish deshpande , a renowned sociologist from new delhi explains : “ the demand is born out of a feeling that reservations and quotas are the only effective way in which the community as a whole can be benefited or can progress . ”
the indian government ’ s affirmative action policy sets aside job and seats at educational insitutions for people from disadvantaged groups , also classified as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes .
the aim is to flatten centuries-old social hierarchies , which led to widespread discrimination in the past .
‘ scheduled caste status ’ the gujjars are largely categorised as a disadvantaged group , but they want to be reclassified downwards as a scheduled tribe , the status that some of their community members enjoy in the states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh .
they claim they are economically left out and downwards reclassification would help them get more benefits .
the issue is currently gridlocked with the state and central governments taking different positions .
the government in rajasthan , which is run by the bhartiya janata party , the main opposition group at the national level , has asked the gujjars to take their initiative to the central government . prime minister manmohan singh has however referred the case to the law ministry , asking it to examine the legality of the demand .
need for a change in attitudes professor deshpande explains , where , he thinks , the solution to the crisis lies : “ from a long term point of view , clearly reservation can not help .
it works only if we think of it as a special solution needed in specific cases .
in any case , the state is unable to provide anywhere near the number of jobs that are needed to take communities forward . ”
he believes a change in attitudes is vital , especially among upper caste people : “ in the short run , the biggest change is needed in the attitude of those , who oppose this without thinking where demands like these are coming from .
the opposition to reservation from the upper caste stems , in my opinion , from a very short- sighted and narrow-minded point of view , which doesn ’ t acknowledge the many benefits that upper caste status continue to bestow in independent india .
and those benefits remain invisible , whereas benefits explicitly linked to caste become very visible .
and it is because of this that we have a lot of tensions today . ”
so far the gujjar leaders have refused to call off their agitation .
they also say any negotiation with the government is only possible if they are assured of getting the special status which they demand . disha uppal 29/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .

in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .

deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?
they ’ d surely want to focus on eastern europe .
the mediterranean union is sarkozy ’ s baby , but not everyone else ’ s , ” o ' donnell added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bayer vital does not agree with the legal position , " the company stated , but said it would accept the fine to avoid a legal battle .
it said it had reviewed its practices and adjusted them as needed .
unlawful deals late last year , the cartel office searched the offices of bayer .
subsequently , bayer vital had cooperated with the authorities , which was taken into account when determining the fine it would be obliged to pay , the cartel office said . since 2004 , pharmacies have been allowed to set the price of over-the-counter medication , such as aspirin and cough syrup , themselves .
it is illegal for pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies to forge agreements on prices , the watchdog said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the departure is overdue , " said christian democrat thomas strobl .
" take the necessary consequences . " social democrat stephan hisberg , one of the founders of the east german spd , accused gysi and his left party of " lying and betraying . "
recurring allegations gysi , a lawyer , has been battling allegations he colluded with the east german secret police for years .
he responded to the attacks on the floor of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , with an impassioned speech .
he rejected the allegations , saying that politicians from other parties had for years used every means to try to damage him personally in order to harm his party . at issue this time is a 1979 meeting between gysi and two east german dissidents , one of which was his client robert havemann .
the head of the stasi archive , marianne birthler , had provoked the new debate with comments she made on ard television on wednesday , in which she alleged that documents in the archive 's possession concerning the meeting stemmed from an informer who could only be gysi . gysi took legal action against zdf television after it broadcast similar comments birthler made last week . at a left party convention last week , gysi rejected the accusations , saying he had never consciously or willingly cooperated with the stasi .
threat from the left ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine had called for birthler 's dismissal . " the boss of the stasi -lsb- archive -rsb- is not in the position to exercise her duties objectively and impartially , " he said . the left party was established by trade unionists and former social democrats a year ago .

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .
this would be the carrier for both us and international consignments .
the restructuring is expected to cost $ 2 billion .
under the deal , the company will pay ups $ 1 billion a year for 10 years to carry its us domestic and international shipments within north america .
us business in trouble deutsche post , based in bonn , said it remained committed to serving us customers and that less than 4 percent of its shipments would be affected .
dhl 's yellow air freighters , which fly large volumes of mail around the us , are expected to vanish from us skies , but dhl vans and offices on the ground would continue as before .
dhl 's us operations have posted unspecified losses since it entered the market in 2004 against stiff competition from rivals ups and fedex .
the restructuring plan foresees cutting losses to $ 800 to $ 900 million by 2009 and less than $ 500 million by 2010 .
lay-offs ahead frank appel , the deutsche post chief executive , was optimistic that the deal with ups made economic sense and would help to secure dhl 's shaky position in the us market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.05.2008 aviation industry cautious of recovery amid economic fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has high hopes for future sales despite delays and postponements aircraft manufacturers at the berlin air show forecast wednesday , may 28 , rising demand over the next 20 years for cargo planes as world trade grows , but signs mounted that the stumbling us economy might spoil the boom . aircraft manufacturers at the berlin air show forecast at a conference wednesday , may 28 , that rising demand over the next 20 years for cargo planes as world trade grows , but signs mounted that the stumbling us economy might spoil the boom .
airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when it comes to marriage proposals , going down on one knee seems a little passé to some .
one young german man made a real effort to do something different , almost sparking the end of the world along the way . thinking that a fleet of extra terrestrial visitors from the zeta reticuli constellation were passing overhead on their way to dominate the earth , shocked residents of the bavarian town of plattling fled in panic and inundated the local law enforcement department with frantic calls . now , before alerting the military and having a squadron of missile-laden tornados whipping overhead sending the rest of the state into a scene of chaos reminiscent of war of the worlds , the local cops went by the book and investigated the sighting themselves first . creative twist spreads fear and chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your average best man far from stumbling into a mass abduction or alien invasion , the cause for the mass hysteria was an innovative marriage proposal set up by a 29-year old resident . the young man who had released into the air 50 tiny hot-air balloons made of paper with little candles burning under them , in an attempt to get his girlfriend into the mood to say " yes , " was found sitting by the isar river with his beloved . after informing the young man of the incident that his romantic gesture had prompted , the police left the lovers in peace , disappointed that they had not had to chase a ufo across the countryside or apprehend visitors from outer space . oh , and the guy 's girlfriend agreed to become his wife . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the departure is overdue , " said christian democrat thomas strobl .
" take the necessary consequences . " social democrat stephan hisberg , one of the founders of the east german spd , accused gysi and his left party of " lying and betraying . "
recurring allegations gysi , a lawyer , has been battling allegations he colluded with the east german secret police for years .
he responded to the attacks on the floor of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , with an impassioned speech .
he rejected the allegations , saying that politicians from other parties had for years used every means to try to damage him personally in order to harm his party . at issue this time is a 1979 meeting between gysi and two east german dissidents , one of which was his client robert havemann .
the head of the stasi archive , marianne birthler , had provoked the new debate with comments she made on ard television on wednesday , in which she alleged that documents in the archive 's possession concerning the meeting stemmed from an informer who could only be gysi . gysi took legal action against zdf television after it broadcast similar comments birthler made last week . at a left party convention last week , gysi rejected the accusations , saying he had never consciously or willingly cooperated with the stasi .
threat from the left ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine had called for birthler 's dismissal . " the boss of the stasi -lsb- archive -rsb- is not in the position to exercise her duties objectively and impartially , " he said . the left party was established by trade unionists and former social democrats a year ago .

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bayer vital does not agree with the legal position , " the company stated , but said it would accept the fine to avoid a legal battle .
it said it had reviewed its practices and adjusted them as needed .
unlawful deals late last year , the cartel office searched the offices of bayer .
subsequently , bayer vital had cooperated with the authorities , which was taken into account when determining the fine it would be obliged to pay , the cartel office said . since 2004 , pharmacies have been allowed to set the price of over-the-counter medication , such as aspirin and cough syrup , themselves .
it is illegal for pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies to forge agreements on prices , the watchdog said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gujjars have been demanding more opportunities to qualify for government jobs as well as quotas in educational institutions .
the protests , which started a few days ago , turned violent last week , claiming 37 lives . the gujjars are an ethnic tribe , traditionally shepherds , who comprise more than 50 million of the population .
for the most part , they live across india ’ s northern and western states .
their protest started from rajasthan last week and has now spread to other regions . the gujjars are calling for more reserved quotas in the government ’ s affirmative action plan .
professor satish deshpande , a renowned sociologist from new delhi explains : “ the demand is born out of a feeling that reservations and quotas are the only effective way in which the community as a whole can be benefited or can progress . ”
the indian government ’ s affirmative action policy sets aside job and seats at educational insitutions for people from disadvantaged groups , also classified as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes .
the aim is to flatten centuries-old social hierarchies , which led to widespread discrimination in the past .
‘ scheduled caste status ’ the gujjars are largely categorised as a disadvantaged group , but they want to be reclassified downwards as a scheduled tribe , the status that some of their community members enjoy in the states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh .
they claim they are economically left out and downwards reclassification would help them get more benefits .
the issue is currently gridlocked with the state and central governments taking different positions .
the government in rajasthan , which is run by the bhartiya janata party , the main opposition group at the national level , has asked the gujjars to take their initiative to the central government . prime minister manmohan singh has however referred the case to the law ministry , asking it to examine the legality of the demand .
need for a change in attitudes professor deshpande explains , where , he thinks , the solution to the crisis lies : “ from a long term point of view , clearly reservation can not help .
it works only if we think of it as a special solution needed in specific cases .
in any case , the state is unable to provide anywhere near the number of jobs that are needed to take communities forward . ”
he believes a change in attitudes is vital , especially among upper caste people : “ in the short run , the biggest change is needed in the attitude of those , who oppose this without thinking where demands like these are coming from .
the opposition to reservation from the upper caste stems , in my opinion , from a very short- sighted and narrow-minded point of view , which doesn ’ t acknowledge the many benefits that upper caste status continue to bestow in independent india .
and those benefits remain invisible , whereas benefits explicitly linked to caste become very visible .
and it is because of this that we have a lot of tensions today . ”
so far the gujjar leaders have refused to call off their agitation .
they also say any negotiation with the government is only possible if they are assured of getting the special status which they demand . disha uppal 29/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .
several important russian personalities were passed over this year , while more than 10 foreign scientists - from the united states , france , china , italy , ukraine and finland - were voted in . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the departure is overdue , " said christian democrat thomas strobl .
" take the necessary consequences . " social democrat stephan hisberg , one of the founders of the east german spd , accused gysi and his left party of " lying and betraying . "
recurring allegations gysi , a lawyer , has been battling allegations he colluded with the east german secret police for years .
he responded to the attacks on the floor of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , with an impassioned speech .
he rejected the allegations , saying that politicians from other parties had for years used every means to try to damage him personally in order to harm his party . at issue this time is a 1979 meeting between gysi and two east german dissidents , one of which was his client robert havemann .
the head of the stasi archive , marianne birthler , had provoked the new debate with comments she made on ard television on wednesday , in which she alleged that documents in the archive 's possession concerning the meeting stemmed from an informer who could only be gysi . gysi took legal action against zdf television after it broadcast similar comments birthler made last week . at a left party convention last week , gysi rejected the accusations , saying he had never consciously or willingly cooperated with the stasi .
threat from the left ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine had called for birthler 's dismissal . " the boss of the stasi -lsb- archive -rsb- is not in the position to exercise her duties objectively and impartially , " he said . the left party was established by trade unionists and former social democrats a year ago .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '
laying claim to intellectual heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kant 's " critique of pure reason " is a philosophy course standard the country that produced such giants of western philosophy as kant and hegel has largely turned its back on philosophy , asserts nida-ruemelin , who teaches in munich ..
" yet german-language philosophy is so important in the rest of the world that you find a lot of italians especially learning german just so that they can read works by martin heidegger in the original , " he said .
" we neglect this vast intellectual heritage . "
peter nickl , a philosophy lecturer at hanover university who devised the festival , has chosen popular themes such as soccer -lrb- lecture : physical activity and psychic turmoil -rrb- and depression -lrb- the ill soul -rrb- , as well as the classics -lrb- leibniz 's concept of mind -rrb- .
hanover profiles a famous son the hanover city council , which is hosting the festival in partnership with the university philosophy department , aims to remind locals about one of the city 's greatest sons , gottfried wilhelm leibniz -lrb- 1646-1716 -rrb- .
the philosopher is better known among literate non-germans than among his own countrymen , festival organizers say .
hanover university was formally named leibniz university after him , but many germans only associate the name with the popular leibniz brand of cookies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel may be germany 's best-known philosopher top speakers booked for the festival include the catholic ethicist robert spaemann , 81 , and franco volpi , one of italy 's top contemporary philosophers .
a variety of venues planned " we want to overcome prejudices and prove how useful philosophy really is , " said nickl .
events are planned on a main city square , in cafes , gardens , churches and museums .
there will be an art show , concerts and theater performance , and a gourmet dinner , " at the table with the great thinkers , " in a hanover restaurant . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 germany pledges to destroy cluster bomb stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will destroy 97 percent of its conventional cluster bomb arsenal by 2015 germany unexpectedly announced on thursday , may 29 , that it would complete the destruction of its arsenal of cluster bombs in line with a new international treaty proposing a complete ban of the dangerous weapons . the announcement came as a surprise to many .
the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
" i hate to see countries like canada for example , the uk , france , germany , australia , who were leaders in the movement to ban landmines , doing the dirty work of the u.s , " williams said .
" they are trying to create a loophole big enough to fly a us attack helicopter loaded with cluster munitions through it , " she told reuters .
" the issue i have with the united states is that it is working overtime to try to influence the negotiations without having the wherewithal and courage to come here itself and do its own dirty work , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de over 100 states agree on landmark cluster bomb ban more than 100 governments have agreed on a draft convention to ban cluster bombs , which have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians .

the german defense minister franz josef had made it very clear before the treaty was agreed upon on wednesday that germany would not consider decommissioning its remaining stockpiles .
as efforts intensified to pressure those nations which had not signed the treaty , germany made its announcement in the hope that its actions would spur others to act similarly .
under the agreement , germany would actually be required to destroy 97 percent of its cluster bomb supplies by the target date of 2015 .
the remaining three percent come under the title " intelligent cluster bombs , " a derivative supposedly designed to compensate for the wind distribution carrying bomblets away from the intended target , which is not covered by the new treaty .
campaigners have agitated for a ban because of the risk of civilians being killed or maimed by the indiscriminate , wide-area effect of the conventional cluster bombs .
they also pose a lasting threat as many bomblets fail to explode on impact but go off later .
critics of the weapons also complain that even these so-called " intelligent " bombs can not be relied upon to remain in the target area .
possible coalition split narrowly avoided ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel get between jung and steinmeier on the issue ?
germany 's u-turn on the issue has some observers believing that the defense ministry , headed by the conservative jung , had been forced to adapt its stance by the foreign ministry under its social democrat head frank-walter steinmeier .
it was widely believed that the differing of opinion over the approach to the accord was adding pressure onto an already fraught coalition relationship .
however , in berlin , steinmeier and jung said in a joint statement that the agreement was an " important milestone . "
" we see it as a confirmation of our sustained engagement against this category of weapons which in the past has caused unspeakable suffering among civilian populations , " they said , adding that berlin would ratify the accord as soon as possible after the agreement is signed in oslo on dec .
2-3 .
" in advance , we have decided today that germany will already , with immediate effect , ban all types of cluster bombs and destroy its remaining stockpiles as soon as possible , " the statement said .
" with this step we are making a strong statement : we want other states that are still holding back to follow our example and join the cluster bomb ban without delay . "
a foreign ministry spokesman added : " the draft treaty now has to be signed as soon as possible .
at the same time , we will press with all our might for the convention to apply worldwide . "
delegates from 111 nations agreed on the treaty after ten days of painstaking negotiations in the irish capital dublin .
conditions allow non-signatories to continue manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato used cluster bombs in serbia during the war of 1999 however , key cluster bomb manufacturers such as the united states , russia , china , india , israel and pakistan did not attend the talks and are thus not covered by the agreement .
under pressure from nato , the text of the convention contains a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions , by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories .
the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster- bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries which continue to use the bombs .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- urged all states to adhere to the treaty " in the near future " and called on them to stop using cluster munitions regardless of whether they participated in the dublin talks .
" the icrc has regularly witnessed the terrible impact of cluster munitions on civilians , " its president jakob kellenberger said in a statement .
" the convention adopted in dublin means that these weapons are not only morally unacceptable but also now illegal under international humanitarian law . "
norway , which will host the signing ceremony , also called for " the greatest number of countries possible " to join the dublin accord , which foreign minister jonas gahr stoere described as " historic " and " a victory for humanitarian law . "
critics see treaty euphoria as inappropriate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors say the treaty has been annulled by the us anti-cluster bomb campaigners were in less effusive mood , however , claiming that the united states had bullied its allies into weakening the treaty .
jody williams , who won the 1997 nobel peace prize together with her international campaign to ban landmines , said genuine peacekeeping operations backed by the united nations would not be affected by a global ban on cluster bombs .
the united states argued on wednesday that the treaty could jeopardize us participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations by " criminalizing " military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .

" bayer vital does not agree with the legal position , " the company stated , but said it would accept the fine to avoid a legal battle .
it said it had reviewed its practices and adjusted them as needed .
unlawful deals late last year , the cartel office searched the offices of bayer .
subsequently , bayer vital had cooperated with the authorities , which was taken into account when determining the fine it would be obliged to pay , the cartel office said . since 2004 , pharmacies have been allowed to set the price of over-the-counter medication , such as aspirin and cough syrup , themselves .
it is illegal for pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies to forge agreements on prices , the watchdog said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .
there are plenty of obstacles in making a mediterranean partnership work , because israel , the arab states , turkey and the maghreb countries in northern africa are so diverse , “ she said . “ they don ’ t see themselves as one entity , ” she said . according to a european commission plan outlined last week , two parallel sets of eu and non-eu presidencies would be established for six months on a rotating basis . “ on the non-eu side , what would happen if the presidency is held by a country such as syria that is hostile to israel ? ” asked o ’ donnell . still o ’ donnell viewed the mediterranean union as slightly different from the stalled barcelona process launched in 1995 , a euro-mediterranean partnership , and the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- that followed in 2004 after eu enlargement pushed the frontiers further east . re-focusing barcelona process “ it could revitalize barcelona with a shift in focus , ” she said , explaining that barcelona was more about achieving political and democratic reforms in the region , whereas the new entity focuses on more concrete goals such as tackling the problem of illegal immigration and pushing for a euro-mediterranean free trade zone by 2010 . free trade and freedom of movement for the maghreb and middle east countries are intertwined , according to stark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan focuses on concrete goals like curbing illegal immigration “ we can ’ t have free trade and stop migration .
what non-eu countries want is liberalization of the visa system for example .
as romano prodi -lrb- former president of the european commission -rrb- once said ‘ the eu-mediterranean should share in everything but our institutions ’ , ” he said . except for turkey , which is keen to join the eu , most of the other mediterranean countries simply want greater access to europe , he said . keeping turkey out of the eu o ’ donnell said that offering turkey the alternative of a closer mediterranean partnership was supposed to discourage the mainly muslim country from joining the eu . “ that was one of the main motivations behind sarkozy ’ s original initiative - to keep turkey out of the eu , ” she said . ankara has made clear that it sees no alternative to its goal of eu membership , and its foreign minister ali babacan told the turkish newspaper hurriyet this week that turkey has not yet made a decision about joining the new union . “ assessments are underway .
we should clearly see what this union for mediterranean is all about , ” said babacan . o ’ donnell agrees that the whole mediterranean concept was unclear from the outset .
“ the eu has this habit of adding a new layer of bureaucracy every five years or so , ” she said . “ depending on how this union evolves , it has the potential to tackle some big issues , ” she added . but it 's unclear whether france 's enthusiasm for the project will be shared by other eu members . “ what happens at the start of next year when france no longer holds the eu presidency , and the czechs take over ?

" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.05.2008 aviation industry cautious of recovery amid economic fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has high hopes for future sales despite delays and postponements aircraft manufacturers at the berlin air show forecast wednesday , may 28 , rising demand over the next 20 years for cargo planes as world trade grows , but signs mounted that the stumbling us economy might spoil the boom . aircraft manufacturers at the berlin air show forecast at a conference wednesday , may 28 , that rising demand over the next 20 years for cargo planes as world trade grows , but signs mounted that the stumbling us economy might spoil the boom .
airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .

" bayer vital does not agree with the legal position , " the company stated , but said it would accept the fine to avoid a legal battle .
it said it had reviewed its practices and adjusted them as needed .
unlawful deals late last year , the cartel office searched the offices of bayer .
subsequently , bayer vital had cooperated with the authorities , which was taken into account when determining the fine it would be obliged to pay , the cartel office said . since 2004 , pharmacies have been allowed to set the price of over-the-counter medication , such as aspirin and cough syrup , themselves .

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .
according to un estimates , they continue to present a lethal threat in more than 30 countries . obligations to nato british prime minister gordon brown welcomed the dublin agreement and spoke of a " huge stride forward " in making the world safer . britain had helped move the talks forward with london 's pledge to demobilize cluster bombs against the will of its military leadership . the breakthrough was possible , diplomats said , after participants agreed to accept one of the united states ' main demands , pushed through with backing from nato countries , including germany . the special rule will allow nations which sign the anti-cluster-bomb convention to participate in common military missions with the us and other countries that continue to use the bombs . but the concession may not be sufficient to allow nato countries to live up to their obligations .
german defense minister franz-josef jung told parliamentarians there would not be enough alternative munitions until 2015 , the daily berliner zeitung reported .
us defends use despite the compromise , the draft convention was greeted by the cluster munition coalition as a very strong step .
cmc includes 200 civil society and professional organizations working for the cluster bomb ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without the backing of the main producers , the ban may not amount to much human rights watch , quoting expert analysts , said the treaty would require the us to remove its stockpiles of cluster bombs at several military bases around the world . the united states last week defended further use of cluster bombs , saying they remained tactically useful for fending off advancing armies and were being redesigned with electronic timers to ensure the bomblets either exploded as intended or self-destructed . " we think this kind of blanket ban is a mistake , " said stephen mull , the us state department 's top official for political and military affairs . the united states last used the weapons during the 2003 invasion of iraq but has n't employed them since then , mull said , because cluster bombs have few applications against insurgencies .

when its name is leibniz germany will kick off its first philosophy festival , the " elation of ideas , " with the aim of bringing weighty topics out of the ivory tower and into the public sphere . starting thursday , may 29 , some big names in academia will take part in more than 30 philosophy events for audiences of all ages .
the elation of ideas festival , in the northern city of hanover , will run through sunday , june 1 .
entrance is free of charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nietzche is a well-known german thinker the event was inspired by the festival di filosofia , which attracts over 100,000 people annually to modena , italy . philosophy of everyday decisions julian nida-ruemelin , a philosopher who was once the german chancellor 's chief adviser on culture and is to open the festival , says philosophy is anything but an irrelevant scholarly pursuit .
wherever people weigh the ethics of an everyday situation , they conduct a small philosophical inquiry , nida-ruemelin says .
" everybody is a philosopher in a sense , whether you want to be or not , " he said .
" even four-year-old children ask questions about the meaning of life or why we die .
but instead of being glad about the stimulating questions , we often slap down their curiosity . "
" we often deter them from asking again .
we say , ' what a silly question ' or ' do n't be rude ' or ' there is n't any answer . " '

the participating german museum administrations are the state museums of berlin , the state art collections of dresden and the bavarian state painting collections of munich .
dubai 's plan for a universal museum of world art at khor dubai rivals a project in neighboring abu dhabi to build branches of the paris louvre and the guggenheim museum of modern art in a " cultural district " of abu dhabi 's offshore saadiyat island .
both emirates are building world-class cities intended to become magnets for tourists .
focus on arab culture " dubai has a great future as the laboratory of globalization in the 21st century , with culture gaining a bigger focus , " said schindhelm , who was formerly chief executive of the berlin opera foundation and has access to senior german culture figures .
martin kobler of germany 's foreign ministry voiced support for the link-up with the three cities ' art collections , saying he hoped they made a strong impression in the gulf .
the khor dubai project is also to include a $ 1-billion -lrb- 640-million-euro -rrb- opera house .
schindhelm said the museum would cover a wide range of cultural history " from manuscripts to astronomy " with arab culture in the foreground .
he said a pavilion designed by dutch architect rem koolhaas would be used for exhibitions until the great museum had been built . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 29.05.2008 deutsche telekom offices raided as spying scandal deepens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation of a spying scandal may tarnish deutsche telekom 's reputation a probe into a major spying scandal at deutsche telekom escalated on thursday with prosecutors raiding the company 's offices and launching investigations against two former bosses of europe 's biggest phone company . in a new twist to an escalating privacy scandal engulfing deutsche telekom , german prosecutors said on thursday , may 28 , they had opened investigations against two former bosses at the company and raided the offices of the beleaguered telecommunications giant , based in bonn .
" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann is under rising pressure to shed light on the snooping affair telekom 's current ceo , rene obermann , who is under growing pressure to clear up the affair but who was not in charge at the time of the spying affair , has said state prosecutors and a law firm in cologne were investigating the affair .
he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
it is also the latest in a string of privacy invasion scandals to hit a major german company .
earlier this year , it emerged that discount food retailer lidl had hired detectives to install micro-cameras that filmed employees while at work and on their breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus chief executive thomas enders said 1,700 air-freight aircraft were currently flying the world 's skies , but in two decades the number would more than double to 4,200 .
he was speaking at the european congress on air transport , an event during this week 's air show , known by its german initials as the ila , at schoenefeld international airport south-east of berlin .
the show is a combination of hard sell in the exhibition booths and the romance of flying outside in the skies .
military pilots competed with one another wednesday to put on the best flying display at the air show .
among them were hal dhruv helicopters sent by the indian air force , partner nation at this year 's show .
each painted with a stylized peacock , the four helicopters wheeled in formation over the airfield while releasing marker smoke .
dhl looking to outsource among signs of trouble for the aerospace industry was an announcement the same day by parcels company dhl that it would cease its own air-transport operations within the united states and contract out the airlift job for 10 years to its rival , ups .
dhl , a unit of german company deutsche post world net , has struggled against the soaring cost of moving mail and parcels as the price of aviation fuel jumps and sales are squeezed by the slowdown .
dhl express chief executive john mullen justified dhl dispensing with its own yellow cargo planes in north america by arguing that the company did not need to maintain " infrastructure that customers do n't ask for . "
sales of airbus planes to be postponed in another sign of trouble in the us market , jet blue airways said in san francisco it was postponing purchase of 21 airbus jets because of soaring fuel prices .
jet blue chief executive dave barger said the airline had to be financially cautious .
the original order foresaw delivery of the a320 jets between 2009 and 2011 .
jet blue , in which lufthansa of germany has a 20-percent stake , expects to accept the aircraft between 2014 and 2015 instead .
but gulf air of bahrain ordered 35 jets wednesday from airbus at the air show in a purchase package with a list price of $ 4.86 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- .
the discount terms for the bulk order were not disclosed .
the state-owned airline will obtain 15 airbus a320 jets and 20 airbus a330-300 planes , the two companies said .
enders said the jet blue statement and plans by qantas to idle some planes and cancel an order for one airbus should not be overrated .
he insisted , " we are expecting another very good year for airbus in 2008 and aim to build 24,000 planes in the next 20 years . "
the figure includes passenger , cargo and military planes .
he said that after subtracting cancellations , airbus had taken 397 orders so far this year and had delivered 162 jets by the end of april from its main factories in toulouse , france and hamburg , germany .
industry analysts have suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of airbus orders are " soft , " having been placed by financially shaky customers .
airbus said that at the end of last year it had 3,421 plane orders in hand , with 1,341 orders received in 2007 .
calls for more envionmental responsibility during discussion of the cargo business , peter hintze , the german government 's coordinator of aviation policy , appealed to the aerospace industry to pay more attention to criticisms of the planes ' pollution and climate-change impact .
he said the extensive use of older jets for air cargo meant greater public sensitivity about the freight business .
older planes are generally noisier and use more fuel per ton carried than new ones .
many air freighters are created by removing seats from second-hand passenger jets and fitting them with rear doors .
enders ' sales forecast included about 900 brand-new air-freighters to be sold in the next two decades .
statistics at the air show indicated international air cargo tonnages growing 5 percent annually in recent years and analysts maintained that despite the financial crisis the world rate would accelerate to 6 percent annually in the next few years .
airbus hit by european skills crunch in other developments , airbus announced a global recruiting drive to find 500 engineers after thomas enders admitted that the company was having difficulties finding qualified specialists in europe .
" we will recruit 500 engineers all over the world this year .
we need the best and the brightest worldwide for our industry , " enders told a news briefing .
" our sector is very challenging and in big demand of highly skilled engineers .
unfortunately , we do n't find them in europe . "
the airbus boss said that in particular he needed staff familiar with lightweight composite materials used to make the next generation of passenger jets and also electrical designers .
after bemoaning a sufficient supply of such candidates in europe , enders added : " we are looking for global partnerships . "
he noted that airbus had opened training centers for engineers in countries where the air transport market was expected to grow , citing china , india and russia . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted , because this honor comes from a country close to my heart , " schroeder 's office in berlin quoted him as saying in emailed comments to dpa news agency .
" i understand this acknowledgement as a motivation to engage in further improvement of the partnership between europe and russia , " schroeder was quoted as saying .
schroeder , 64 , stunned europe in 2005 when he agreed to head russian energy monopoly gazprom 's project to carry russian gas to germany via a pipeline on the baltic sea base .
his decision was criticized as a sell-out to the kremlin at a time when a gas dispute between gazprom and ukraine threatened supplies to europe and drove the eu to concentrate efforts on protecting its energy security by diversifying gas supplies away from russia . schroeder was offered 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- per year , ria novosti reported .
strong russia the academy said schroeder 's work highlighted that " europe needs a strong russia " for good bilateral relations to develop that would act as to " guarantee stability . "
it also gave special praise to schroeder 's autobiography " decisions : my life in politics , " one chapter of which is devoted to " russia as a global player . "
russia 'a new president dmitry medvedev , who also chairs gazprom 's board of directors , wrote the preface to the 2007 russian edition of the book .
the russian media reported that former president vladimir putin , who enjoyed friendly relations with schroeder over their seven-year cooperation , oversaw the decision . but many were critical of the appointment of a politician and businessman to the academy 's ranks , saying it brought down the level of the science-oriented body .

" since this morning , there have been investigative procedures " at the deutsche telekom offices , said a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel was in the news recently for tax evasion state prosecutors also confirmed to news agency dpa that they had launched investigations against former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke and the former chairman of deutsche telekom 's supervisory board , klaus zumwinkel .
in addition , labor representatives on telekom 's supervisory board also said on thursday that they were pressing charges against europe 's largest phone company for serious breaches of privacy and trust .
" we want to contribute to the clarification of the affair and at the same time to protect the reputation of the company , " said lothar schroeder , vice president of the supervisor board .
cameras in the newsroom deutsche telekom was forced to concede over the weekend that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ftd said deutsche telekom had snooped on its reporters using secret cameras in the newsroom the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and labor representatives at the company .
deutsche telekom said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 and has to date admitted only to spying on german business magazine capital .
but on thursday , another business newspaper , financial times deutschland alleged it was a victim of espionage by deutsche telekom several years earlier .
the daily said deutsche telekom had hired private detectives to spy on its reporters in 2000 and had even secretly filmed the newsroom .
" their main target was the ftd 's chief reporter at the time , tasso enzweiler , who often broke stories about the telecommunication sector , " the paper said .
" the private detectives even used a hidden camera to try and get information about enzweiler 's source from the news room in cologne . "
both the ftd and capital belong to the publishing house gruner und jahr , which is in turn owned by german media giant bertelsmann .
the publisher has warned that it is considering both criminal and civil charges against deutsche telekom .
pressure grows on obermann deutsche telekom has insisted that the surveillance did not involve listening in to phone conversations but rather tracking calls made by members of the supervisory board to certain numbers .
the job of tracking the calls was outsourced to a data-mining company in berlin .

he also stressed that deutsche telekom clients were not being wiretapped .
the " personal data of our millions of fixed-line and mobile clients was secure , " he told germany 's top-selling newspaper bild .
the telekom spying scandal has however shaken germany where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

" the departure is overdue , " said christian democrat thomas strobl .
" take the necessary consequences . " social democrat stephan hisberg , one of the founders of the east german spd , accused gysi and his left party of " lying and betraying . "
recurring allegations gysi , a lawyer , has been battling allegations he colluded with the east german secret police for years .
he responded to the attacks on the floor of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , with an impassioned speech .
he rejected the allegations , saying that politicians from other parties had for years used every means to try to damage him personally in order to harm his party . at issue this time is a 1979 meeting between gysi and two east german dissidents , one of which was his client robert havemann .
the head of the stasi archive , marianne birthler , had provoked the new debate with comments she made on ard television on wednesday , in which she alleged that documents in the archive 's possession concerning the meeting stemmed from an informer who could only be gysi . gysi took legal action against zdf television after it broadcast similar comments birthler made last week . at a left party convention last week , gysi rejected the accusations , saying he had never consciously or willingly cooperated with the stasi .
threat from the left ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine had called for birthler 's dismissal . " the boss of the stasi -lsb- archive -rsb- is not in the position to exercise her duties objectively and impartially , " he said . the left party was established by trade unionists and former social democrats a year ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.05.2008 gujjar agitation spreads in india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gujjars burn effigies during a stir in new delhi life in indian capital new delhi came to a virtual standstill on thursday , when members of the ethnic gujjar community held demonstrations .
the gujjars have been demanding more opportunities to qualify for government jobs as well as quotas in educational institutions .
the protests , which started a few days ago , turned violent last week , claiming 37 lives . the gujjars are an ethnic tribe , traditionally shepherds , who comprise more than 50 million of the population .
for the most part , they live across india ’ s northern and western states .
their protest started from rajasthan last week and has now spread to other regions . the gujjars are calling for more reserved quotas in the government ’ s affirmative action plan .
professor satish deshpande , a renowned sociologist from new delhi explains : “ the demand is born out of a feeling that reservations and quotas are the only effective way in which the community as a whole can be benefited or can progress . ”
the indian government ’ s affirmative action policy sets aside job and seats at educational insitutions for people from disadvantaged groups , also classified as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes .
the aim is to flatten centuries-old social hierarchies , which led to widespread discrimination in the past .
‘ scheduled caste status ’ the gujjars are largely categorised as a disadvantaged group , but they want to be reclassified downwards as a scheduled tribe , the status that some of their community members enjoy in the states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh .
they claim they are economically left out and downwards reclassification would help them get more benefits .
the issue is currently gridlocked with the state and central governments taking different positions .
the government in rajasthan , which is run by the bhartiya janata party , the main opposition group at the national level , has asked the gujjars to take their initiative to the central government . prime minister manmohan singh has however referred the case to the law ministry , asking it to examine the legality of the demand .
need for a change in attitudes professor deshpande explains , where , he thinks , the solution to the crisis lies : “ from a long term point of view , clearly reservation can not help .
it works only if we think of it as a special solution needed in specific cases .
in any case , the state is unable to provide anywhere near the number of jobs that are needed to take communities forward . ”
he believes a change in attitudes is vital , especially among upper caste people : “ in the short run , the biggest change is needed in the attitude of those , who oppose this without thinking where demands like these are coming from .
the opposition to reservation from the upper caste stems , in my opinion , from a very short- sighted and narrow-minded point of view , which doesn ’ t acknowledge the many benefits that upper caste status continue to bestow in independent india .
and those benefits remain invisible , whereas benefits explicitly linked to caste become very visible .
and it is because of this that we have a lot of tensions today . ”
so far the gujjar leaders have refused to call off their agitation .
they also say any negotiation with the government is only possible if they are assured of getting the special status which they demand . disha uppal 29/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

this meant that only eu countries on the 27-nation bloc ’ s southern flank , such as france , spain and italy met the criteria for a geographical grouping that stretches from morocco to israel , syria and turkey . sarkozy ’ s “ mediterranean dream ” was supposed to provide a forum for tackling regional issues that ranged from stopping illegal boat migration from africa and combating terrorism to harnessing solar energy and cleaning up the polluted sea . but there were numerous problems with the proposal , with germany playing a key role in torpedoing sarkozy ’ s original plan , say eu experts .
german chancellor angela merkel had insisted that the initiative be anchored within existing eu structures and must include all member states . franco-german rift the rift between france and germany had become so deep over the french proposal that a bilateral mini-summit scheduled in the bavarian town of straubing in march was cancelled . however on monday , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm confirmed that the meeting will take place on june 9 and focus on climate change .
sarkozy will also brief merkel on his agenda when france assumes the eu ’ s rotating presidency in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel remains wary of the club med plan “ france and germany have been the driving force of european integration for decades now , so if one of them disagrees with the other ’ s initiative , it never becomes major eu policy , ” said hans stark , a franco-german expert at the paris-based french institute of international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- . the now official “ barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ” is expected to be the cornerstone of the french eu presidency and will be officially launched in paris in mid-july . what was at issue for germany was a violation of a basic trust between the two countries , according to stark . club med not just an eu subset “ sarkozy went about this unilaterally without consulting merkel , ” he said , explaining that it is impossible to forge a coherent eu neighborhood policy with an exclusive subset within the eu going off in a separate direction . stark said the issue also applies to other regional groupings , such as the recent polish-swedish initiative to establish an eastern partnership that would permit visa-free travel and create a free trade zone with former soviet countries such as the ukraine and georgia . “ the potential danger is that a small group of member countries pursue their own narrow interests at the expense of the eu as a whole , creating a north-south divide that could split europe into two , ” he said . clara marina o ’ donnell , a research fellow on eu neighborhood policy and the middle east at the centre for european reform -lrb- cer -rrb- in london , said , however , that the key issue is not whether the entire eu or only a sub-group of countries is involved in negotiations with its southern neighbors . sharing a coastline does not bind countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediterranean countries do not see themselves as one entity “ the question is how effective the europeans are in addressing conflicts in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.05.2008 over 100 states agree on landmark cluster bomb ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cluster bombs are notorious for resulting in civilian deaths more than 100 governments have agreed on a draft convention to ban cluster bombs , which have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians .
but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .
thus , it is unclear what effect it will have once it comes into power .
danger to children especially the most recent reported use of cluster bombs was during the july-august 2006 israeli incursion into lebanon .
israel was heavily criticized for dropping such munitions in civilian areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dublin conference appears to have achieved its aim cluster bombs drop hundreds of tennis-ball-sized smaller explosives , known as " bomblets , " which then scatter and detonate across the battlefield .
many bomblets fail to explode for years , posing a threat to civilians , especially children who often mistake them for toys . the death toll ranges into the tens of thousands of civilians killed , blinded or otherwise maimed by the weapons .

but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us . the agreement , reached during the night of wednesday , may 28 , outlaws the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs .
it also entails a commitment to remove cluster bombs from national arsenals within eight years and to provide for the welfare of the victims of cluster bombs . the anti-cluster-bomb convention was the result of nearly two weeks of diplomatic wrangling in the irish capital , dublin .
under pressure from nato countries , the text includes a concession to the us and other countries which want to continue to use and produce such munitions by allowing military cooperation between signatories and non-signatories . the 111 states are expected to approve the draft text on friday , the final day of the conference .
it will be signed in december in oslo . the main producers and users of cluster bombs - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - did not attend the conference and said they would not support the convention .

the logistics giant said ups and dhl would sign a contract transferring dhl express " airlift " functions within north america to ups .

the restructuring is expected to cost $ 2 billion .
under the deal , the company will pay ups $ 1 billion a year for 10 years to carry its us domestic and international shipments within north america .

" for many years after the war i had the impression that the germans understood the immense scope of the crime of the holocaust which they had committed ...
but this time , they made an error , " gutman told rzeczpospolita .
" the location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument .
if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals , it 's a scandal , " gutman said , according to afp .
" a sense of proportion must be maintained . "
across the street from jewish memorial the simple grey rectangular stone monument was unveiled earlier this week by berlin 's openly gay mayor , klaus wowereit , at the tiergarten park , half a block from the iconic brandenburg gate and across the street from germany 's national memorial to jewish victims of the holocaust .
designed by danish-norwegian artists michael elmgreen and ingar dragset , the monument contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a gay couple kissing .
a text on the stone surface details the persecution of gays under hitler .
the nazis banned homosexuality in 1936 and convicted around 50,000 people for " unnatural " behavior deemed unbecoming of the aryan " master race . "
it is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals were deported to nazi concentration camps , where more than half died .
gutman , himself a holocaust survivor , said the nazis persecuted " exclusively german " homosexuals , many of them nazis .
they were " victims of internal political battles within the nsdap , " the nazi party of adolf hitler , he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alzheimer 's society said up to two-thirds of people in england with dementia are never diagnosed as they do not recognise the symptoms .
the charity is giving gps in england posters and leaflets to raise awareness about the issue and a toolkit to support diagnosis .
it is estimated by 2025 over 1m people in the country will have dementia .
the department of health is backing the alzheimer 's society campaign to raise public awareness of symptoms and the importance of an early diagnosis .
health minister ivan lewis said : " dementia is now one of the most significant health challenges facing our society .
" that is why we are determined to bring dementia out of the shadows . "
currently 700,000 people in the uk live with the disease and one-in-three people over the age of 65 will die with it .
when to seek help do you struggle to remember recent events while finding it easy to recall things that happened in the past ?
do you find it hard to follow conversations or programmes on tv ?
do you regularly forget the names of friends or everyday objects ?
do you find it difficult to recall things heard , seen or read ?
do you struggle to make decisions ?
do you repeat yourself in conversation or lose the thread of what you are saying ?
do you have problems thinking and reasoning ?
do you feel anxious and depressed or angry about forgetfulness ?
do other people comment on your forgetfulness ?
there are more than 100 different types .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common type , affecting 62 % of those diagnosed .
others include vascular dementia and mixed dementia .
for those who do report their symptoms to the gp , it takes an average of nearly three years for a diagnosis from first noticing symptoms , the alzheimer 's society said .
neil hunt , its chief executive , said : " there is an acute lack of awareness and understanding of dementia .
" by encouraging people who are worried about their memory problems to seek medical advice sooner than they might have done , we hope more people with dementia can get care early on , giving them a greater chance to live life as well and as fully as possible . "
he added that people could reduce their risk of dementia by cutting down on salt , eating lots of fruit and vegetables , keeping active and watching their weight .
a recent study by the national audit office found only 30 % of gps feel that they have enough basic information and training to diagnose and manage the disease .
professor steve field , chair of the royal college of gps , said it could be hard to diagnose dementia but patients would be encouraged to visit their gp if they had concerns .
" there are treatable causes of memory loss and gps are always happy to see patients who are concerned and we can reassure them and if not we can offer treatment and support . "

current rates of natural decline might reduce global gdp by about 7 % by 2050 .
the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- review is modelled on the stern review of climate change .
it will be released at the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- meeting in bonn , where 60 leaders have pledged to halt deforestation by 2020 .
" you come up with answers like 6 % or 8 % of global gdp when you think about the benefits of intact ecosystems , for example in controlling water , controlling floods and droughts , the flow of nutrients from forest to field , " said the project 's leader pavan sukhdev .
" but then you realise that the major beneficiaries -lsb- of nature -rsb- are the billion and a half of the world 's poor ; these natural systems account for as much as 40 % -50 % of what we define as the ' gdp of the poor ' , " he told bbc news .
globalised decline the teeb review was set up by the german government and the european commission during the german g8 presidency .
the two institutions selected mr sukhdev , a managing director in the global markets division at deutsche bank , to lead it .
at the time , in an article for the bbc news website , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel wrote : " biological diversity constitutes the indispensable foundation for our lives and for global economic development .
sigmar gabriel : why cost nature ?
" -lsb- but -rsb- two-thirds of these ecosystem services are already in decline , some dramatically .
we need a greening of globalisation . "
the document to be released at the cbd is an interim report into what the team acknowledges are complex , difficult and under-researched issues .
the 7 % figure is largely based on loss of forests .
the report will acknowledge that the costs of losing some ecosystems have barely been quantified .
the trends are understood well enough - a 50 % shrinkage of wetlands over the past 100 years , a rate of species loss between 100 and 1,000 times the rate that would occur without 6.5 billion humans on the planet , a sharp decline in ocean fish stocks and one third of coral reefs damaged .
however , putting a monetary value on them is probably much more difficult , the team acknowledges , than putting a cost on climate change .
the report highlights some of the planet 's ecologically damaged zones such as haiti , where heavy deforestation - largely caused by the poor as they cut wood to sell for cash - means soil is washed away and the ground much less productive .
' too little , too late ' there are some indications that biodiversity and ecosystem issues are now being heard at the top tables of politics .
g8 environment ministers meeting in japan last weekend agreed a document noting that " biodiversity is the basis of human security and ... the loss of biodiversity exacerbates inequality and instability in human society " .
ecosystem damage is likely to reduce food supplies in vulnerable areas it also emphasised the importance of protected areas and of curbing deforestation .
at the cbd on wednesday , 60 countries signed pledges to halt net deforestation by 2020 .
but the main cbd target agreed by all signatories at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 - to " halt and begin to reverse " biodiversity loss by 2010 - is very unlikely to be met .
an early draft of the teeb review , seen by bbc news , concluded : " lessons from the last 100 years demonstrate that mankind has usually acted too little and too late in the face of similar threats - asbestos , cfcs , acid rain , declining fisheries , bse and - most recently - climate change " .
the stern review talked to governments in a way that earlier climate reports could not , because it was written by and for economists ; and the architects of teeb hope it will eventually do the same thing for biodiversity .

the report will acknowledge that the costs of losing some ecosystems have barely been quantified .
the trends are understood well enough - a 50 % shrinkage of wetlands over the past 100 years , a rate of species loss between 100 and 1,000 times the rate that would occur without 6.5 billion humans on the planet , a sharp decline in ocean fish stocks and one third of coral reefs damaged .
however , putting a monetary value on them is probably much more difficult , the team acknowledges , than putting a cost on climate change .
the report highlights some of the planet 's ecologically damaged zones such as haiti , where heavy deforestation - largely caused by the poor as they cut wood to sell for cash - means soil is washed away and the ground much less productive .
' too little , too late ' there are some indications that biodiversity and ecosystem issues are now being heard at the top tables of politics .
g8 environment ministers meeting in japan last weekend agreed a document noting that " biodiversity is the basis of human security and ... the loss of biodiversity exacerbates inequality and instability in human society " .
ecosystem damage is likely to reduce food supplies in vulnerable areas it also emphasised the importance of protected areas and of curbing deforestation .
at the cbd on wednesday , 60 countries signed pledges to halt net deforestation by 2020 .
but the main cbd target agreed by all signatories at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 - to " halt and begin to reverse " biodiversity loss by 2010 - is very unlikely to be met .
an early draft of the teeb review , seen by bbc news , concluded : " lessons from the last 100 years demonstrate that mankind has usually acted too little and too late in the face of similar threats - asbestos , cfcs , acid rain , declining fisheries , bse and - most recently - climate change " .
the stern review talked to governments in a way that earlier climate reports could not , because it was written by and for economists ; and the architects of teeb hope it will eventually do the same thing for biodiversity .

the britons - a computer expert and his four bodyguards - are believed to be held by an offshoot shiite militia calling itself " the islamic shiite resistance in iraq " and demanding the release of fellow militiamen in us custody .
their plight has received little public attention apart from two videos released by the kidnappers and a small number of appeals by relatives and religious figures .
but now for the first time , the men 's families have gathered together for this anniversary to speak exclusively to the bbc .
sister 's appeal lisette , the sister of jason , the hostage who appeared in the first public " proof-of-life " video in december flanked by two unidentified gunmen , was first to speak .
she said : " please , please release my brother , he 's a father , a son , and a brother to myself .
" we miss him dearly .
you know , make the 12 months ... give him back , let him come home to his family .
we really miss him , there 's not a day , or a minute or anything that goes by without us thinking about jason .
we really want him home . "
the five britons were driven away that day in a convoy towards the sprawling shiite district of sadr city . "
we 've got to believe that the outcome 's going to be positive " father of hostage alec within hours , iraqi police cordoned off whole streets and carried out a series of raids , but in vain .
the kidnappers eventually made contact , calling for the release of a man called qais al-khazaali and other shia figures held by us forces .
yet they asked for a media blackout and the british government complied , wary of doing anything that could jeopardise the captives ' safety .
since then , hostage negotiators have been quietly conducting a dialogue with intermediaries in iraq .
they say the kidnappers are not extremist fanatics , they are behaving professionally , they have negotiable aims and appear to want to keep their prisoners alive and well-treated for an eventual exchange .
' shell shock ' one year on since the kidnap , colin , the father of another hostage , alec , is still hoping for a peaceful outcome .
" well we 've got to believe that the outcome 's going to be positive .
and we do believe that .
i think that the initial shock - the first week - was a complete blank .
" to be honest , we were so shocked by the news .
because , like every individual , one often thinks it will never happen to you , it will always happen to someone else .
" when the reality sets in that it 's actually your son , things pale into insignificance for the first three days , shell shock .
" as things develop you sort of live with it , although you never completely get used to it , you 've got to live with it , otherwise it will destroy you .
" so as a family we are very strong and positive that he will return .
and we just hope that it will be sooner than later . "
good memories in fact all the families are trying hard to stay strong .
for them , this last year has been a living nightmare , made worse by the scarcity of any news .
but rather than wringing their hands in despair , they want to cheer the men up with memories of good times they hope will be repeated .
this was jan , a friend of a third hostage who , confusingly , is also called jason .
" my favourite memory of jason i remember when his daughter was born , just seeing the look on his face .
i 'll never forget that as long as i live , when his only daughter was born .
" the look of happiness .
i was the first person in there after she was born and it was a really poignant moment for me , a moment i 'll never forget , just the look on his face when he held her . yes he loves her dearly , his only daughter .
" she loves him very , very much as well and misses him massively . "
another relative , caroline , spoke of her brother-in-law , alan .
" i think about alan as somebody who 's a very vibrant personality , lots of enthusiasm , very much a risk-taker .
loves motor-biking , sky diving , in fact i think his daughter has inherited that from him .
last year , they were due to go on holiday and do some sky diving . "
that appointment , she says , is on hold until he gets out .
when that will be , nobody but the kidnappers can tell .
as so often happens with hostage situations , it 's a case of waiting , hoping and praying .

the britons - a computer expert and his four bodyguards - are believed to be held by an offshoot shiite militia calling itself " the islamic shiite resistance in iraq " and demanding the release of fellow militiamen in us custody .
their plight has received little public attention apart from two videos released by the kidnappers and a small number of appeals by relatives and religious figures .
but now for the first time , the men 's families have gathered together for this anniversary to speak exclusively to the bbc .
sister 's appeal lisette , the sister of jason , the hostage who appeared in the first public " proof-of-life " video in december flanked by two unidentified gunmen , was first to speak .
she said : " please , please release my brother , he 's a father , a son , and a brother to myself .
" we miss him dearly .
you know , make the 12 months ... give him back , let him come home to his family .
we really miss him , there 's not a day , or a minute or anything that goes by without us thinking about jason .
we really want him home . "
the five britons were driven away that day in a convoy towards the sprawling shiite district of sadr city .
we 've got to believe that the outcome 's going to be positive father of hostage alec within hours , iraqi police cordoned off whole streets and carried out a series of raids , but in vain .
the kidnappers eventually made contact , calling for the release of a man called qais al-khazaali and other shia figures held by us forces .
yet they asked for a media blackout and the british government complied , wary of doing anything that could jeopardise the captives ' safety .
since then , hostage negotiators have been quietly conducting a dialogue with intermediaries in iraq .
they say the kidnappers are not extremist fanatics , they are behaving professionally , they have negotiable aims and appear to want to keep their prisoners alive and well-treated for an eventual exchange .
' shell shock ' one year on since the kidnap , colin , the father of another hostage , alec , is still hoping for a peaceful outcome .
" well we 've got to believe that the outcome 's going to be positive .
and we do believe that .
i think that the initial shock - the first week - was a complete blank .
" to be honest , we were so shocked by the news .
because , like every individual , one often thinks it will never happen to you , it will always happen to someone else .
" when the reality sets in that it 's actually your son , things pale into insignificance for the first three days , shell shock .
" as things develop you sort of live with it , although you never completely get used to it , you 've got to live with it , otherwise it will destroy you .
" so as a family we are very strong and positive that he will return .
and we just hope that it will be sooner than later . "
good memories in fact all the families are trying hard to stay strong .
for them , this last year has been a living nightmare , made worse by the scarcity of any news .
but rather than wringing their hands in despair , they want to cheer the men up with memories of good times they hope will be repeated .
this was jan , a friend of a third hostage who , confusingly , is also called jason .
" my favourite memory of jason i remember when his daughter was born , just seeing the look on his face .
i 'll never forget that as long as i live , when his only daughter was born .
" the look of happiness .
i was the first person in there after she was born and it was a really poignant moment for me , a moment i 'll never forget , just the look on his face when he held her . yes he loves her dearly , his only daughter .
" she loves him very , very much as well and misses him massively . "
another relative , caroline , spoke of her brother-in-law , alan .
" i think about alan as somebody who 's a very vibrant personality , lots of enthusiasm , very much a risk-taker .
loves motor-biking , sky diving , in fact i think his daughter has inherited that from him .
last year , they were due to go on holiday and do some sky diving . "
that appointment , she says , is on hold until he gets out .
when that will be , nobody but the kidnappers can tell .
as so often happens with hostage situations , it 's a case of waiting , hoping and praying .

but rather than wringing their hands in despair , they want to cheer the men up with memories of good times they hope will be repeated .
this was jan , a friend of a third hostage who , confusingly , is also called jason .
" my favourite memory of jason i remember when his daughter was born , just seeing the look on his face .
i 'll never forget that as long as i live , when his only daughter was born .
" the look of happiness .
i was the first person in there after she was born and it was a really poignant moment for me , a moment i 'll never forget , just the look on his face when he held her . yes he loves her dearly , his only daughter .
" she loves him very , very much as well and misses him massively . "
another relative , caroline , spoke of her brother-in-law , alan .
" i think about alan as somebody who 's a very vibrant personality , lots of enthusiasm , very much a risk-taker .
loves motor-biking , sky diving , in fact i think his daughter has inherited that from him .
last year , they were due to go on holiday and do some sky diving . "
that appointment , she says , is on hold until he gets out .
when that will be , nobody but the kidnappers can tell .
as so often happens with hostage situations , it 's a case of waiting , hoping and praying .

more than 2,200 homes and businesses in low lying areas between pagham harbour and west wittering , west sussex , face flooding as sea levels rise .
the agency also said erosion could cause almost 1,500 properties to be lost to the sea .
the predictions were made in a 100-year plan for the coast .
' funding competition ' the agency has announced a set of recommendations to manage flooding and erosion risks along the coastal stretch , along with councils in chichester and arun .
the draft coastal strategy proposes the vast majority of properties should be protected to their current standard or better , but highlights funding pressures to build and maintain defences .
james humphrys , solent and south downs area manager for the environment agency , said : " the people who live and work in this area are faced with the very real threat of flooding and erosion .
" we believe that the draft strategy proposals can manage these risks , but central government funding is limited and there is strong competition from around the country . "

more than 2,200 homes and businesses in low lying areas between pagham harbour and west wittering , west sussex , face flooding as sea levels rise .
the agency also said erosion could cause almost 1,500 properties to be lost to the sea .
the predictions were made in a 100-year plan for the coast .
' funding competition ' the agency has announced a set of recommendations to manage flooding and erosion risks along the coastal stretch , along with councils in chichester and arun .
the draft coastal strategy proposes the vast majority of properties should be protected to their current standard or better , but highlights funding pressures to build and maintain defences .
james humphrys , solent and south downs area manager for the environment agency , said : " the people who live and work in this area are faced with the very real threat of flooding and erosion .
" we believe that the draft strategy proposals can manage these risks , but central government funding is limited and there is strong competition from around the country . "
a three-month public consultation , which ends on 29 august , will allow people to submit their views on the recommendations .

yet she is not interested in fame , she says .
" do you want a cake ? "
duffy has only just sat down , but can not contain her excitement about a basket of goodies at reception .
she gets up and returns with two buns topped with stars and stripes icing .
her debut album has just gone straight to number four in the us , and her record label has sent novelty baked goods to celebrate .
" is n't that amazing ? " she bubbles .
" this is for the american debut .
normally people would send artists champagne and the like .
but me , cake .
what does that say about my personality ?
sweet ? "
i did n't want to be famous - i still do n't want to be famous duffy her label has reason to be pleased .
as well as her swift and seemingly painless us conquest , duffy 's album rockferry has sold more than 600,000 copies in the uk , where her single mercy was number one for five weeks and its follow-up warwick avenue is now in the top 10 .
but as she begins talking , disaster strikes .
with a gesture of her hand , duffy 's celebratory cake flies through the air and lands upside down with the thick icing sticking to her manager 's wooden floor .
" oh my god ! " she shouts .
" no , no - two second rule ! "
she leans over and picks up it .
" look , it never happened . "
shoving it into her mouth whole , she mumbles joyously : " no-one will ever know . "
keeping it real those few words probably sum up duffy better than an in-depth interview .
she clearly does not belong to the breed of preened and paranoid celebrities who would never be seen dead eating a cake , let alone scooping one off a floorboard of questionable cleanliness .
she is not your average spice girl .
" i 'm not lying to you , that was my breakfast and i probably only woke up about an hour ago , " duffy says .
i made a record that was just about music - no dreams , no ambitions , no expectation duffy " threw things into a bag and left my house .
people offer me hair and make-up all the time , but i do my own hair and make-up , wear what i want , say what i want and i feel as though that 's the only way to survive .
" i 'm just trying to be myself , not trying to kid myself .
so i just kinda want to be real with it , because that 's the only way i 'm going to keep my sanity . "
in a post-winehouse world , the 23-year-old subscribes to the belief that image is less important and quality can not be manufactured .
" people want something that 's real . "
her attitude towards image and fame can be traced back to her early attempts at pop stardom .
in her teens , duffy " wanted the world and i thought i could achieve it " , she says , speaking of a " dangerous ambition where i thought i could make a record " .
but she continues with some bitterness : " i knew what i wanted for many years but people used me a lot along the way as a vehicle for their vision , not mine .
" and so i really pulled back when i was about 18 and decided i could n't achieve what i wanted , i could n't go all the way in music .
" i think then my shift changed completely and i just became almost a quite withdrawn singer . "
struggling with fame after accepting that she would never realise her dream - or so she thought - she decided to make music just for her own fulfilment .
but once you stop looking for something , you often find it , as they say , and that personal project became rockferry .
" and so now i get this place , " she explains .
" i made a record that was just about music .
no dreams , no ambitions , no expectation , nothing .
i just made a bunch of songs .
" the pop star thing really , really was n't at all in my mind or a priority .
i did n't want to be famous .
i still do n't want to be famous . "
i do n't want to become self-indulgent and consume everything you can possibly consume duffy six months into her newfound career , she is still learning how to deal with the attention and speaks with some bewilderment about how an album that was so personal to her has also become so personal to others .
one of the hardest things to handle is when people tell her she is amazing , she says .
" i do n't really know what that means , and i do n't dwell on it but it does n't make me feel any different .
" i feel like they 're just being nice .
i do n't look for that reassurance .
i 'm not longing for people to tell me i 'm great .
i do n't do this to be loved - i make music because i love music . "
but like it or not , she is a pop star - so what is her new life like ?
" the door 's open to everything , " she says .
" you can go where you want , you can do what you want , you can have what you want .
" but i just do n't want any of that .
i do n't want to become self-indulgent and consume everything you can possibly consume .
" my nan used to have a motto , which was : ' when you stop wanting , you stop wanting to live . '
i do n't want to have everything .

" everything is meaningless unless it 's something you 're passionate about and believe in , and that 's the music . "

" you can go where you want , you can do what you want , you can have what you want .
" but i just do n't want any of that .
i do n't want to become self-indulgent and consume everything you can possibly consume .
" my nan used to have a motto , which was : ' when you stop wanting , you stop wanting to live . '
i do n't want to have everything .

" everything is meaningless unless it 's something you 're passionate about and believe in , and that 's the music . "

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- music is a piece of cake for duffy british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment arts & culture also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 08:00 gmt , thursday , 29 may 2008 09:00 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version music is a piece of cake for duffy by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news duffy 's single mercy was number one for five weeks in the uk chart with the uk 's best-selling album of the year so far and an enthusiastic welcome in the us , welsh soul singer duffy has taken just six months to become the world 's favourite new star .
yet she is not interested in fame , she says .
" do you want a cake ? "
duffy has only just sat down , but can not contain her excitement about a basket of goodies at reception .
she gets up and returns with two buns topped with stars and stripes icing .
her debut album has just gone straight to number four in the us , and her record label has sent novelty baked goods to celebrate .
" is n't that amazing ? " she bubbles .
" this is for the american debut .
normally people would send artists champagne and the like .
but me , cake .
what does that say about my personality ?
sweet ? "
i did n't want to be famous - i still do n't want to be famous duffy her label has reason to be pleased .
as well as her swift and seemingly painless us conquest , duffy 's album rockferry has sold more than 600,000 copies in the uk , where her single mercy was number one for five weeks and its follow-up warwick avenue is now in the top 10 .
but as she begins talking , disaster strikes .
with a gesture of her hand , duffy 's celebratory cake flies through the air and lands upside down with the thick icing sticking to her manager 's wooden floor .
" oh my god ! " she shouts .
" no , no - two second rule ! "
she leans over and picks up it .
" look , it never happened . "
shoving it into her mouth whole , she mumbles joyously : " no-one will ever know . "
keeping it real those few words probably sum up duffy better than an in-depth interview .
she clearly does not belong to the breed of preened and paranoid celebrities who would never be seen dead eating a cake , let alone scooping one off a floorboard of questionable cleanliness .
she is not your average spice girl .
" i 'm not lying to you , that was my breakfast and i probably only woke up about an hour ago , " duffy says .
i made a record that was just about music - no dreams , no ambitions , no expectation duffy " threw things into a bag and left my house .
people offer me hair and make-up all the time , but i do my own hair and make-up , wear what i want , say what i want and i feel as though that 's the only way to survive .
" i 'm just trying to be myself , not trying to kid myself .
so i just kinda want to be real with it , because that 's the only way i 'm going to keep my sanity . "
in a post-winehouse world , the 23-year-old subscribes to the belief that image is less important and quality can not be manufactured .
" people want something that 's real . "
her attitude towards image and fame can be traced back to her early attempts at pop stardom .
in her teens , duffy " wanted the world and i thought i could achieve it " , she says , speaking of a " dangerous ambition where i thought i could make a record " .
but she continues with some bitterness : " i knew what i wanted for many years but people used me a lot along the way as a vehicle for their vision , not mine .
" and so i really pulled back when i was about 18 and decided i could n't achieve what i wanted , i could n't go all the way in music .
" i think then my shift changed completely and i just became almost a quite withdrawn singer . "
struggling with fame after accepting that she would never realise her dream - or so she thought - she decided to make music just for her own fulfilment .
but once you stop looking for something , you often find it , as they say , and that personal project became rockferry .
" and so now i get this place , " she explains .
" i made a record that was just about music .
no dreams , no ambitions , no expectation , nothing .
i just made a bunch of songs .
" the pop star thing really , really was n't at all in my mind or a priority .
i did n't want to be famous .
i still do n't want to be famous . "
i do n't want to become self-indulgent and consume everything you can possibly consume duffy six months into her newfound career , she is still learning how to deal with the attention and speaks with some bewilderment about how an album that was so personal to her has also become so personal to others .
one of the hardest things to handle is when people tell her she is amazing , she says .
" i do n't really know what that means , and i do n't dwell on it but it does n't make me feel any different .
" i feel like they 're just being nice .
i do n't look for that reassurance .
i 'm not longing for people to tell me i 'm great .
i do n't do this to be loved - i make music because i love music . "
but like it or not , she is a pop star - so what is her new life like ?
" the door 's open to everything , " she says .
" you can go where you want , you can do what you want , you can have what you want .
" but i just do n't want any of that .
i do n't want to become self-indulgent and consume everything you can possibly consume .
" my nan used to have a motto , which was : ' when you stop wanting , you stop wanting to live . '
i do n't want to have everything .
" so when the door 's open to everything , i have to step back and say i do n't want to fill my life with meaningless shit .
" everything is meaningless unless it 's something you 're passionate about and believe in , and that 's the music . "

stanley johnson , who is based in devon , said it would be " superb " to represent the constituency in oxfordshire .
but the conservatives have instead picked three local candidates as possible contenders .
a date for the by-election , which has come about by boris johnson becoming london 's mayor , is yet to be set .
there have been reports the party could capitalise on its by-election victory in crewe and nantwich by setting a mid-summer date to elect a new mp for henley .
' local candidate ' but any contest will not feature stanley johnson , who said : " of course i am very disappointed but i certainly understand and accept the reasons .
" the local conservative association has decided in this instance to restrict the short-list to local candidates .
" i am sure whoever is selected by the members will do a superb job and will win a convincing victory . "
stanley johnson has previously worked in the european commission .
the three tory candidates are local councillors john howell , ann ducker and john cotton .
john walsh , chairman of the south oxfordshire conservative association , said : " where we have not chosen a local candidate the liberal democrats very much pick up on that and criticise it significantly .
" i think it is designed this time that nothing goes wrong .
the primary importance is to make sure our electors turn out . "
labour 's richard mckenzie , the liberal democrats ' stephen kearney and the green party 's mark stevenson have already been selected to fight a by-election .
the uk independence party has selected chris adams .
boris johnson succeeded former deputy prime minister michael heseltine as mp for henley at the 2001 general election with a majority of 8,458 .
he was re-elected in 2005 with an improved majority of 12,793 and a 53 % share of the vote .
