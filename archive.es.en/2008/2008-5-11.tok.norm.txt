the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "

kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 voter turnout tails off in serbia 's parliamentary election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after an initial surge in voting , serbs started to lose interest as the day wore on turnout slowed sharply in serbian snap parliamentary elections sunday , may 11 after a strong start , as apathy appeared to take over after the first hours of a vote seen as key for the troubled country 's course . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "

kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 weak turnout in serbian election may benefit anti-western bloc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fateful election will determine serbia 's future direction the snap parliamentary election seen as fateful for serbia 's future came to a close sunday with surprisingly weak turnout and concerns that it would benefit the surging anti-western bloc . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- . but after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to reach just 54.2 per cent with an hour remaining in the vote , according to figures by the private election monitoring agency cesid . the turnout in the previous parliamentary poll , in january 2007 , was 60.4 per cent and in the presidential run-off vote on february 3 , when tadic defeated the srs leader tomislav nikolic , was 67.6 per cent . pre-election polls gave srs a slight lead over the ds , with each tipped to win around a third of the votes .
the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 weak turnout in serbian election may benefit anti-western bloc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fateful election will determine serbia 's future direction the snap parliamentary election seen as fateful for serbia 's future came to a close sunday with surprisingly weak turnout and concerns that it would benefit the surging anti-western bloc . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- . but after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to reach just 54.2 per cent with an hour remaining in the vote , according to figures by the private election monitoring agency cesid . the turnout in the previous parliamentary poll , in january 2007 , was 60.4 per cent and in the presidential run-off vote on february 3 , when tadic defeated the srs leader tomislav nikolic , was 67.6 per cent . pre-election polls gave srs a slight lead over the ds , with each tipped to win around a third of the votes .
the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 weak turnout in serbian election may benefit anti-western bloc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fateful election will determine serbia 's future direction the snap parliamentary election seen as fateful for serbia 's future came to a close sunday with surprisingly weak turnout and concerns that it would benefit the surging anti-western bloc . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- . but after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to reach just 54.2 per cent with an hour remaining in the vote , according to figures by the private election monitoring agency cesid . the turnout in the previous parliamentary poll , in january 2007 , was 60.4 per cent and in the presidential run-off vote on february 3 , when tadic defeated the srs leader tomislav nikolic , was 67.6 per cent . pre-election polls gave srs a slight lead over the ds , with each tipped to win around a third of the votes .
the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect .

analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .

kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .

the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german president horst koehler has also ruled out a meeting because of scheduling difficulties , his spokesman , martin kothe told bild am sonntag newspaper . television journalist franz alt dismissed the reason as a poor excuse .
" the president is kneeling for the chinese , " alt said .
" that is cowardice . "
he said it made no sense for german leaders to refuse a meeting when the chinese themselves were holding such meetings .
the dalai lama told a german newspaper that the negotiations between his representatives and chinese authorities were being held in an atmosphere that was " not aggressive but respectful , " but also that the west had to keep pressuring china to produce results at the negotiating table .

" i would have expected more courage from steinmeier , " erwin huber , head of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .

chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .

" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .

they confirmed their championship win in style on saturday in the hard-fought 3-2 win away to msv duisburg .
hitzfeld , who is leaving to coach the swiss national side , will hand over control to klinsmann , who guided germany to third at the 2006 world cup , when he takes over as head coach on july 1 .

" the club spent heavily , so the pressure was immense , but winning the league makes it all worthwhile .
" i 'm delighted for the club , because we 're back to where we belong as number one in germany .
and i 'm also pleased i 'll be handing juergen klinsmann a great team , " said hitzfeld .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.05.2008 divided over kosovo and eu , serbs take to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian election is seen by many as a referendum about eu membership the serbian people started voting on sunday in snap elections that give them the choice of pursuing eu membership or turning their back on the west out of nationalist defiance over the loss of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president boris tadic sees the future of serbia in the eu the 6.75 million registered voters - including more than 115,000 serbs scattered across kosovo , the albanian-majority province which broke away from serbia almost three months ago - are choosing from 22 tickets .
the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .
many died in the brutal expulsion and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .
the czech government , meanwhile , dampened the hopes of the sudeten germans for an early dialogue , saying it saw no need for such discussions .
" there is no change in our position .
if the sudeten germans see things differently it might be linked to a change in their relationship to the czech republic , " foreign ministry spokeswoman zuzana opletalova was quoted as saying by the czech news agency ctk .
nazi dictator adolf hitler forced czechoslovakia to cede its western sudetenland region to germany in 1938 , saying german speakers were being persecuted there .
hitler seized the rest of the country in early 1939 , ahead of his invasion of poland in september , which precipitated world war ii .
after the war , the seized territory was restored to czechoslovakia , but the postwar expulsions under the benes decrees , which have never been repealed , remain a sore point for many germans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german president horst koehler has also ruled out a meeting because of scheduling difficulties , his spokesman , martin kothe told bild am sonntag newspaper . television journalist franz alt dismissed the reason as a poor excuse .
" the president is kneeling for the chinese , " alt said .
" that is cowardice . "
he said it made no sense for german leaders to refuse a meeting when the chinese themselves were holding such meetings .
the dalai lama told a german newspaper that the negotiations between his representatives and chinese authorities were being held in an atmosphere that was " not aggressive but respectful , " but also that the west had to keep pressuring china to produce results at the negotiating table .
human rights at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier do n't seem to see eye to eye on german-chinese relations " foreign minister steinmeier risks creating the impression in china that human rights is not a central issue for the german government , " roland koch , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of hesse and a merkel ally , told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" at a time when talks have begun between the chinese and the exiled tibetan leadership , this would be fatal . "
china blames the dalai lama for the unrest , which has led to anti-china protests and calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
" i would have expected more courage from steinmeier , " erwin huber , head of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
another influential conservative , lower saxony premier christian wulff , said it was steinmeier 's duty to get a first-hand report on the talks with china from the dalai lama , whose envoy described the discussions as a " good first step . "
the china factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german president caving in to the pressure from beijing ?
steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- sharply criticized chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet tibet 's spiritual leader last september in berlin as an unnecessary provocation of china .
the meeting angered beijing and put relations between the countries on hold for months .
analysts say steinmeier believes that regular contacts with his chinese counterparts and informal links to the tibetans are the best way of dealing with the tibet issue . but koch told the newspaper welt am sonntag that steinmeier ran the risk that china would perceive " human rights is no longer as important an issue for the german government as it was when the chancellor received " the dalai lama .

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .
astonishingly , in a town of 102,000 citizens , 25 per cent of jena 's population is today made up of students , most of them attending the renowned friedrich schiller university . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 voter turnout tails off in serbia 's parliamentary election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after an initial surge in voting , serbs started to lose interest as the day wore on turnout slowed sharply in serbian snap parliamentary elections sunday , may 11 after a strong start , as apathy appeared to take over after the first hours of a vote seen as key for the troubled country 's course . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .
many died in the brutal expulsion and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .
the czech government , meanwhile , dampened the hopes of the sudeten germans for an early dialogue , saying it saw no need for such discussions .
" there is no change in our position .
if the sudeten germans see things differently it might be linked to a change in their relationship to the czech republic , " foreign ministry spokeswoman zuzana opletalova was quoted as saying by the czech news agency ctk .
nazi dictator adolf hitler forced czechoslovakia to cede its western sudetenland region to germany in 1938 , saying german speakers were being persecuted there .
hitler seized the rest of the country in early 1939 , ahead of his invasion of poland in september , which precipitated world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .
many died in the brutal expulsion and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .
the czech government , meanwhile , dampened the hopes of the sudeten germans for an early dialogue , saying it saw no need for such discussions .
" there is no change in our position .
if the sudeten germans see things differently it might be linked to a change in their relationship to the czech republic , " foreign ministry spokeswoman zuzana opletalova was quoted as saying by the czech news agency ctk .
nazi dictator adolf hitler forced czechoslovakia to cede its western sudetenland region to germany in 1938 , saying german speakers were being persecuted there .
hitler seized the rest of the country in early 1939 , ahead of his invasion of poland in september , which precipitated world war ii .
after the war , the seized territory was restored to czechoslovakia , but the postwar expulsions under the benes decrees , which have never been repealed , remain a sore point for many germans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they confirmed their championship win in style on saturday in the hard-fought 3-2 win away to msv duisburg .
hitzfeld , who is leaving to coach the swiss national side , will hand over control to klinsmann , who guided germany to third at the 2006 world cup , when he takes over as head coach on july 1 .
championship maestro hitzfeld talks of pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld will leave for switzerland with his head high " it 's been a unique season , because expectations were so high , " said hitzfeld after the club spent 69 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- last summer to recruit a league-winning side .
" the club spent heavily , so the pressure was immense , but winning the league makes it all worthwhile .
" i 'm delighted for the club , because we 're back to where we belong as number one in germany .
and i 'm also pleased i 'll be handing juergen klinsmann a great team , " said hitzfeld .

they confirmed their championship win in style on saturday in the hard-fought 3-2 win away to msv duisburg .
hitzfeld , who is leaving to coach the swiss national side , will hand over control to klinsmann , who guided germany to third at the 2006 world cup , when he takes over as head coach on july 1 .
championship maestro hitzfeld talks of pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld will leave for switzerland with his head high " it 's been a unique season , because expectations were so high , " said hitzfeld after the club spent 69 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- last summer to recruit a league-winning side .
" the club spent heavily , so the pressure was immense , but winning the league makes it all worthwhile .
" i 'm delighted for the club , because we 're back to where we belong as number one in germany .
and i 'm also pleased i 'll be handing juergen klinsmann a great team , " said hitzfeld .
" this team is capable of mixing it right at the top again next season . "
general manager uli hoeness has promised a big party when the season ends on may 17 with bayern hosting hertha berlin at munich 's allianz arena and the celebrations at winning their 21st crown as german champions can begin .

" it 's been a fantastic season , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the team has achieved great things and we 're very satisfied . "
bayern splashed out last summer by recruiting the likes of italian world cup winner luca toni , french midfielder franck ribery and germany striker miroslav klose .
the team has won the german cup , german league cup and now the bundesliga title this season - only the uefa cup eluded them .
" i think bayern deserve the title , " said club president franz beckenbauer .
" they 've led the league since the opening day , and that does n't happen very often .
a lot of money was spent on new players , but it 's paid off , thank the lord ! " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .

the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2008 german city of jena recovering from unification blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena was named city of science in 2008 the historic city of jena - best known for producing carl zeiss optical instruments in the early 20th century - is enjoying a revival after the upheavals of german unification . most of the east german city 's plants and research institutes were decimated during world war ii , and few believed jena could ever recover , but it did - until the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .
astonishingly , in a town of 102,000 citizens , 25 per cent of jena 's population is today made up of students , most of them attending the renowned friedrich schiller university . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .

while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .

he said it made no sense for german leaders to refuse a meeting when the chinese themselves were holding such meetings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .

german president horst koehler has also ruled out a meeting because of scheduling difficulties , his spokesman , martin kothe told bild am sonntag newspaper . television journalist franz alt dismissed the reason as a poor excuse .
" the president is kneeling for the chinese , " alt said .
" that is cowardice . "
he said it made no sense for german leaders to refuse a meeting when the chinese themselves were holding such meetings .
the dalai lama told a german newspaper that the negotiations between his representatives and chinese authorities were being held in an atmosphere that was " not aggressive but respectful , " but also that the west had to keep pressuring china to produce results at the negotiating table .
human rights at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier do n't seem to see eye to eye on german-chinese relations " foreign minister steinmeier risks creating the impression in china that human rights is not a central issue for the german government , " roland koch , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of hesse and a merkel ally , told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" at a time when talks have begun between the chinese and the exiled tibetan leadership , this would be fatal . "
china blames the dalai lama for the unrest , which has led to anti-china protests and calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
" i would have expected more courage from steinmeier , " erwin huber , head of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
another influential conservative , lower saxony premier christian wulff , said it was steinmeier 's duty to get a first-hand report on the talks with china from the dalai lama , whose envoy described the discussions as a " good first step . "
the china factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german president caving in to the pressure from beijing ?
steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- sharply criticized chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet tibet 's spiritual leader last september in berlin as an unnecessary provocation of china .
the meeting angered beijing and put relations between the countries on hold for months .
analysts say steinmeier believes that regular contacts with his chinese counterparts and informal links to the tibetans are the best way of dealing with the tibet issue . but koch told the newspaper welt am sonntag that steinmeier ran the risk that china would perceive " human rights is no longer as important an issue for the german government as it was when the chancellor received " the dalai lama .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.05.2008 divided over kosovo and eu , serbs take to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian election is seen by many as a referendum about eu membership the serbian people started voting on sunday in snap elections that give them the choice of pursuing eu membership or turning their back on the west out of nationalist defiance over the loss of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president boris tadic sees the future of serbia in the eu the 6.75 million registered voters - including more than 115,000 serbs scattered across kosovo , the albanian-majority province which broke away from serbia almost three months ago - are choosing from 22 tickets .
the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they confirmed their championship win in style on saturday in the hard-fought 3-2 win away to msv duisburg .
hitzfeld , who is leaving to coach the swiss national side , will hand over control to klinsmann , who guided germany to third at the 2006 world cup , when he takes over as head coach on july 1 .
championship maestro hitzfeld talks of pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld will leave for switzerland with his head high " it 's been a unique season , because expectations were so high , " said hitzfeld after the club spent 69 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- last summer to recruit a league-winning side .
" the club spent heavily , so the pressure was immense , but winning the league makes it all worthwhile .
" i 'm delighted for the club , because we 're back to where we belong as number one in germany .
and i 'm also pleased i 'll be handing juergen klinsmann a great team , " said hitzfeld .
" this team is capable of mixing it right at the top again next season . "

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .
astonishingly , in a town of 102,000 citizens , 25 per cent of jena 's population is today made up of students , most of them attending the renowned friedrich schiller university . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .

" it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '

berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .

lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america .

great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .

the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?

local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .
astonishingly , in a town of 102,000 citizens , 25 per cent of jena 's population is today made up of students , most of them attending the renowned friedrich schiller university . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 weak turnout in serbian election may benefit anti-western bloc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fateful election will determine serbia 's future direction the snap parliamentary election seen as fateful for serbia 's future came to a close sunday with surprisingly weak turnout and concerns that it would benefit the surging anti-western bloc . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- . but after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to reach just 54.2 per cent with an hour remaining in the vote , according to figures by the private election monitoring agency cesid . the turnout in the previous parliamentary poll , in january 2007 , was 60.4 per cent and in the presidential run-off vote on february 3 , when tadic defeated the srs leader tomislav nikolic , was 67.6 per cent . pre-election polls gave srs a slight lead over the ds , with each tipped to win around a third of the votes .
the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect . " kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , but serbia went ahead with local elections in parts of the former province where serbs are majority - coinciding with elections in serbia itself . " illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america .

great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .

lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .

dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .

while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .

lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.05.2008 divided over kosovo and eu , serbs take to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian election is seen by many as a referendum about eu membership the serbian people started voting on sunday in snap elections that give them the choice of pursuing eu membership or turning their back on the west out of nationalist defiance over the loss of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president boris tadic sees the future of serbia in the eu the 6.75 million registered voters - including more than 115,000 serbs scattered across kosovo , the albanian-majority province which broke away from serbia almost three months ago - are choosing from 22 tickets .
the crucial choice , however , is between the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , both tipped to win close to one-third of ballots cast .
" the may 11 elections are a form of referendum at which citizens will decide on whether or not serbia ... will be a member of the european union , " tadic said in a pitch to voters at the end of a spiteful campaign .
with neither of the top parties expected to be able to form a government on their own , a three-way coalition will likely be needed to be forged .
king-makers or deal-breakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic wants to break ties with europe over kosovo outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to remain in position of the kingmaker despite its dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .
" the european union will decide by itself whether it wants serbia as a part of it or not .
we want to join the eu , but serbia is a united state within the borders recognised by its membership in the united nations . "
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although his party is not very popular , kostunica is known as the kingmaker of serbian politics milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- already said it would follow kostunica , eight years after they were ousted along with milosevic .
kostunica has led the past two cabinets , since early 2004 , despite never having the most seats in parliament and who would again hold the keys even if he wins the predicted 13 or so percent of votes .
another pro-european group , the fiercely anti-milosevic and pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , has been tipped to be the fifth and final to clear the 5-percent hurdle of votes won to qualify for parliament , along with minority tickets .
eu watches closely the parliamentary poll was called three years early after kostunica 's and tadic 's alliance disintegrated in the tug of war over serbia 's eu course in the aftermath of kosovo 's independence .
some 40 nations , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu , have recognized kosovo since its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared independence on feb .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians protested against serbian elections being held in kosovo russian opposition to kosovo 's unilateral move has so far made it impossible for pristina to seek a united nations seat , while serbia - whose constitution defines the southern province as an inseparable part of the country - proceeded to open 295 polling stations in kosovo for the sunday election , despite opposition kosovo albanians .
the united nations administration in kosovo has branded the poll illegal although it has allowed the serb minority to vote .
the traumatic secession of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed support for the nationalists ahead of the elections .
in a move meant to woo voters disillusioned with the west , the european union signed last week a pre-membership pact with serbia .
but this only added spice to a campaign that was marred by death threats against tadic , as well as bitter mudslinging , counter-accusations and renewal of harsh nationalist rhetoric .
the first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

local observers said a coalition of srs with dss and sps was the most likely outcome .
kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic have wowed to prevent serbia 's closer ties with eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's secession from serbia .
" with the european union , we should not negotiate about anything anymore , without it first clearly saying that serbia is recognised as a whole , " nikolic told reporters after casting his ballot in belgrade .

the weak turnout would likely work in favor of the radicals , with their reliable following . anti-western coalition preparing for government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica is expected to form a government with the radicals outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- is expected to ally with srs and the late strongman slobodan milosevic 's socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- for the next government coalition . such an alliance would signal a sharper turn by belgrade away from the west .
both kostunica and the srs leader nikolic vowed to halt serbia 's progress toward european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership , saying the eu supported the secession of kosovo . the pro-european camp led by tadic would in that case be unable to prevent the collapse of the stabilization and association -lrb- saa -rrb- agreement that serbia 's rump government , dominated by ds , signed with the eu just two weeks ago . the elections , held together with voting for municipal authorities , was forced when tadic and kostunica ended their alliance and the government collapsed on march 1 in a tug of war over serbia 's course . after leading western nations recognized kosovo 's declaration of independence in february , kostunica tried to freeze serbia 's eu membership talks , but was outvoted in his own cabinet by ministers from tadic 's camp . lack of progress weighs heavy on serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's eu vision may suffer from serbia 's apathy although sunday 's election was billed as fateful for the country 's european future by tadic and as crucial in its fight to keep kosovo serbian , the average serb may be too apathetic after disappointing progress in the eight years since the people toppled milosevic . on top of still being almost as poor and isolated as they were under milosevic , subject to a prohibitive and humiliating visa regime by almost all european countries , many serbs also feel betrayed by the west . the sentiment has been eagerly fuelled by nationalists , who describe the international demands for the arrest of war crime suspects and the outcome of the kosovo story - from the nato bombing of serbia in 1999 to its secession - as an anti-serbian conspiracy . the eu agreement and a prospect of a more relaxed visa regime offered by the eu days before sunday 's poll may have been too little too late to prevent the return of the srs and the sps to power , with the dss . first results , based on extrapolation from a sample of polling stations , were expected several hours after voting ended at 8 pm . un deems local elections illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs vote in local elections deemed illegal by the un meanwhile , kosovo serbs defied the united nations and held local elections sunday , but the top un official dismissed the ballot in the serbian enclaves as " illegal " and " without effect .

" illegal elections can not have legal consequences .
their outcome will not be recognized , " united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- head joachim ruecker said in a statement . the separate serb election in kosovo was also opposed by the pristina government . kosovo 's minister for local administration sadri ferati told local media that his government will not recognize the results and will not cooperate with the elected officials . kosovo 's albanian majority declared independence on february 17 , a move recognized by more than 40 countries , including most eu members and the united states . the serbian minority , largely concentrated in northern kosovo close to the serbian border , is keeping close ties with belgrade and refuses to participate in kosovo 's government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 voter turnout tails off in serbia 's parliamentary election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after an initial surge in voting , serbs started to lose interest as the day wore on turnout slowed sharply in serbian snap parliamentary elections sunday , may 11 after a strong start , as apathy appeared to take over after the first hours of a vote seen as key for the troubled country 's course . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .

kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 11.05.2008 burma 's door to aid creaks open as un agencies arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food program flights and un refugee agency trucks started to arrive on saturday the un refugee agency , unhcr , said its first trucks had arrived in burma , carrying emergency aid for survivors of the cyclone , while world food program flights resumed despite disputes with the country 's ruling junta . the trucks , with enough emergency material to provide shelter for up to 10,000 people , had crossed over from thailand at the friendship bridge border at mae sot on saturday , may 10 .
they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .
astonishingly , in a town of 102,000 citizens , 25 per cent of jena 's population is today made up of students , most of them attending the renowned friedrich schiller university . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .
science at city 's new heart the hillside beutenberg campus was created in 1998 along with a string of research institutes and two science centers , one of them for biotechnology .
enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .
nicholas milton , music director and chief conductor of the jena philharmonic , agrees the city has " great cultural ambience . "
orchestras in germany and in other parts of the world often struggle to gain public attention , but in jena " we regularly play to full houses , " says milton , from sydney , australia .
the dynamic young australian arrived in jena in 2004 after being the adelaide symphony orchestra 's concert master for six years .
while most his orchestra members are from germany , there are also musicians from romania , hungary , canada , and the united states .
" we 've concentrated a lot of effort on building up our public and it has paid off immensely , " exudes milton who spends part of each year working as a guest conductor abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 11.05.2008 voter turnout tails off in serbia 's parliamentary election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after an initial surge in voting , serbs started to lose interest as the day wore on turnout slowed sharply in serbian snap parliamentary elections sunday , may 11 after a strong start , as apathy appeared to take over after the first hours of a vote seen as key for the troubled country 's course . some 6.75 million serbs were eligible to choose from 22 tickets , but the real choices were the anti-european bloc led by the ultra- nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- and president boris tadic 's pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" concealment will not resolve the problem .
a lasting reconciliation is possible only on the basis of the historical truth , " beckstein said at the gathering attended by around 8,000 mostly elderly expellees .
beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .
many died in the brutal expulsion and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .
the czech government , meanwhile , dampened the hopes of the sudeten germans for an early dialogue , saying it saw no need for such discussions .
" there is no change in our position .
if the sudeten germans see things differently it might be linked to a change in their relationship to the czech republic , " foreign ministry spokeswoman zuzana opletalova was quoted as saying by the czech news agency ctk .
nazi dictator adolf hitler forced czechoslovakia to cede its western sudetenland region to germany in 1938 , saying german speakers were being persecuted there .
hitler seized the rest of the country in early 1939 , ahead of his invasion of poland in september , which precipitated world war ii .
after the war , the seized territory was restored to czechoslovakia , but the postwar expulsions under the benes decrees , which have never been repealed , remain a sore point for many germans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beckstein shared the view of sudeten leaders that prague might be willing to discuss the issue , but said the " difficult conditions of government " at the moment made a breakthrough unlikely .
he said obstacles on the path to reconciliation were the decrees proclaimed by the late president edvard benes that led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of more than 2 million sudeten germans , who were accused of being nazi collaborators .
another impediment was the law that granted immunity from prosecution to those who committed crimes during the expulsion , beckstein said .

bavaria seeking closer ties to czech republic beckstein , said one of bavaria 's goals was to strengthen relations with the czech republic , with which it shares a common border .
" this will not always be easy but it is a necessary task , " he said .

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .

they bore plastic sheets and tents .
" this convoy marks a positive step in an aid effort so far marked by challenges and constraints , " said raymond hall , unhcr 's representative in thailand .
" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope it opens up a possible corridor to allow more international aid to reach the cyclone victims . "
hall added : " what we are sending in by road is in addition to the supplies we have already procured locally in yangon and the 100 tons of supplies we started airlifting today from dubai . "
unhcr has also started airlifting 100 tons of shelter supplies , including 4,500 plastic sheets and 17,000 blankets , from its dubai stockpile to yangon early on saturday .
the refugee agency is focusing on providing emergency shelter for the cyclone victims in the irrawaddy delta and parts of yangon , which were among the worst hit .
more than one million people are estimated to have lost their homes after cyclone nargis hit last friday .
unhcr has already distributed $ 50,000 -lrb- 32,300 euros -rrb- worth of shelter items bought locally in the aftermath of the storm .
the truck convoy is expected to take around two days from the border to yangon in the south .
the supplies , raided by unhcr from its existing stockpiles normally intended for refugee camps scattered along the thai-burma border , will be distributed by unhcr staff .
unhcr negotiated a concession for the border posts to stay open at the weekend to allow the convoys through .
unhcr launched a $ 187 million appeal for burma on friday which included six million to provide 250,000 cyclone victims with shelter .
food program jets leave for burma despite disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese junta prevented aid from getting through meanwhile , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- on saturday resumed flying emergency supplies into cyclone-devastated burma despite an ongoing dispute with the country 's junta over how the aid will be distributed .
" given the humanitarian crisis , we felt the need to continue the supplies , " said marcus prior , a spokesman for the wfp in bangkok .
on friday , burmese authorities at yangon international airport refused to hand over several tons of high-energy biscuits to wfp officials in burma for distribution to hundreds of thousands of people desperately in need of food as a result of cyclone nargis .
" my understanding is that basically they wanted to distribute the food themselves , " prior told reporters .
while the wfp hashes out terms with burma 's military regime by which the emergency supplies may be released , the agency has allowed another three air shipments of supplies to yangon , scheduled to arrive saturday and sunday .
the wfp generally tries to distribute disaster relief through its own personnel , but has made exceptions in the past in such countries as ethiopia and north korea .
" there is flexibility but for our credibility we need to be accountable to our donors , " said prior .
" we need to provide an assurance that the food gets to the people in need . "
cyclone adds new dimension to junta 's power consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : than shwe and his junta 's credibility is at stake burma 's rulers also have their credibility at stake .
the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the junta held a referendum on saturday on a new constitution designed to cement their political dominance over future elected governments .
the cyclone , which may have killed as many as 100,000 people and left up to 1.9 million in need of emergency aid , has come at an awkward time for the regime .
the country 's 400,000-strong military has been given the double task of monitoring the referendum while at the same time taking the lead in the distribution of emergency aid .
over the past week , state-controlled newspapers and tv have highlighted pictures of military men passing out emergency supplies to the people affected by the cyclone , including , oddly , some shots showing officers handing out video cassette and dvd players to the needy .
the publicity stunt clashes with the reality .
recipients of government handouts have complained of the small quantities and poor quality .
but in burma 's media-controlled environment most people are unaware of the international furor over the junta 's delay tactics in granting visas to disaster relief experts from the un and other aid organizations , which is likely to lead to unnecessary additional deaths to hunger and disease .
survivors at risk of disease epidemics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods and destruction increase the risk of disease international aid organizations warned on friday that diphtheria , cholera and malaria could spread in an epidemic of " apocalyptic proportions " if medical , food , water and other types of aid are not allowed to land , along with trained personnel to administer the support .
in its latest announcements , the government has confirmed 23,335 deaths and some 37,019 missing .
un officials on friday estimated the death toll will climb to 63,000 to 100,000 based on reports from 18 aid organizations working in 55 devastated burmese townships .
while aid is trickling in to the irrawaddy , many people have apparently survived on buddhist charity this week .
in labutta , for instance , the population has doubled as refugees seek shelter and food in the relatively large city .
" there is now some aid coming in but many people are relying on the charity of the burmese families who are residents in labutta , " said heinke veit , a director for the european commission humanitarian aid office -lrb- echo -rrb- .
veit and sources at unicef denied reports that cases of cholera had already been detected in the delta area .
" the chief of health operations for unicef in yangon said there is no evidence of cholera or typhoid yet , although it is a concern , " said shantha bloemen , a spokesperson for unicef in bangkok .
the international federation of the red cross -lrb- ifrc -rrb- in geneva said humanitarian aid had reached around 220,000 people , despite logistical difficulties .
the un said it had received pledges of $ 77 million out of the total of $ 187 million that it has asked for to fund international relief efforts . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a record rush of voters in the first three hours , the turnout slowed to a trickle by mid-afternoon and a weak showing of just 28.5 per cent by 3 pm , with five hours remaining in the election , the central election commission said .
pre-election polls gave the radicals a slight lead , suggesting that serbia was headed for a turn away from the west .
it was believed that a weak turnout would favor the srs with its disciplined , steady following .
outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica is expected to remain the next government 's kingmaker despite his democratic party 's -lrb- dss -rrb- dwindling popularity , with the late slobodan milosevic 's socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- in tow .
analysts tipped a coalition of radicals , dss and socialists as the most likely outcome .
less than three months after kosovo 's secession inflamed political infighting in serbia and forced the early election , the vote was being closely watched by european union officials and the balkan nation 's neighbors .
" i think this time it 's really make-or-break , " said belgrade voter gordana , 35 , who gave only her first name .
" all our elections have been ' crucial , ' but this time i 'm afraid the world is really willing to lock the door and throw away the key . "
kosovo anger bubbling under surface of serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu tadic faces opposition from angry serbs but more serbs may see the recognition of kosovo as a new state by the west as rubbing the salt in the still-open wound of a nato bombing campaign in 1999 , which ended the conflict over kosovo but was also a prelude to its secession .
in addition to uneasy relations with the west , many serbs have sunk into apathy , disillusioned over the meager progress of their country in the eight years since the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today they still are among the poorest europeans , landlocked between countries requiring hard-to-obtain visas for travel and feeling betrayed because of it all .
kostunica , meanwhile , has become openly hostile to the west , including the european union , over its support of kosovo 's independence .
the albanian-dominated province declared itself free from serbia in february .
quick recognition by leading western countries and eu aid to kosovo prompted kostunica to freeze serbia 's progress toward eu membership , which brought down his coalition with tadic after only 10 months .
european membership tied to the rejection of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica and nikolic will not steer serbia towards the eu both kostunica and srs leader tomislav nikolic say they will not allow serbia to negotiate membership with brussels until western nations retract their recognition of kosovo - meaning never .
nikolic insists that serbia would avoid isolation because it could turn its economy toward partners like russia , china and india .
he has sought to reassure foreign investors that they would still be welcome .
tadic and his allies warned voters that serbia risked losing eu development aid and billions of dollars in foreign investment , leading to economic decline and isolation .
serbia 's hopes for moving toward europe hinge on the ratification of a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- by the next parliament - with kostunica and nikolic vowing to annul it .
after casting his ballot in belgrade , nikolic continued to woo kostunica to quickly start negotiating with him and to " finally form a good government with the srs . "
kostunica remained consistent in refusing to commit until after the election , but he said he believed serbia should get a new government " quickly . "
tadic 's ds is unlikely to win enough votes to form a majority with the pro-european liberal-democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- , expected to be the fifth and final party clearing the 5-per-cent hurdle of votes cast to qualify for parliament .
representatives of serbia 's lame-duck government signed the saa on april 29 with tadic present , prompting outraged charges by the nationalist camp that he was selling out the homeland and in effect recognizing kosovo 's independence .
in another eu attempt to bolster serbia 's pro-europeans , 17 european countries agreed five days before the election to end visa fees for most serbs - a first step toward eventual visa-free entry - but that may have been too little , too late .
first estimates of the outcome are expected from agencies processing a sample of polling stations a few hours after the voting ends at 8 pm . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german president horst koehler has also ruled out a meeting because of scheduling difficulties , his spokesman , martin kothe told bild am sonntag newspaper . television journalist franz alt dismissed the reason as a poor excuse .
" the president is kneeling for the chinese , " alt said .
" that is cowardice . "
he said it made no sense for german leaders to refuse a meeting when the chinese themselves were holding such meetings .
the dalai lama told a german newspaper that the negotiations between his representatives and chinese authorities were being held in an atmosphere that was " not aggressive but respectful , " but also that the west had to keep pressuring china to produce results at the negotiating table .
human rights at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier do n't seem to see eye to eye on german-chinese relations " foreign minister steinmeier risks creating the impression in china that human rights is not a central issue for the german government , " roland koch , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of hesse and a merkel ally , told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" at a time when talks have begun between the chinese and the exiled tibetan leadership , this would be fatal . "
china blames the dalai lama for the unrest , which has led to anti-china protests and calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
" i would have expected more courage from steinmeier , " erwin huber , head of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .

they confirmed their championship win in style on saturday in the hard-fought 3-2 win away to msv duisburg .
hitzfeld , who is leaving to coach the swiss national side , will hand over control to klinsmann , who guided germany to third at the 2006 world cup , when he takes over as head coach on july 1 .
championship maestro hitzfeld talks of pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld will leave for switzerland with his head high " it 's been a unique season , because expectations were so high , " said hitzfeld after the club spent 69 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- last summer to recruit a league-winning side .
" the club spent heavily , so the pressure was immense , but winning the league makes it all worthwhile .
" i 'm delighted for the club , because we 're back to where we belong as number one in germany .
and i 'm also pleased i 'll be handing juergen klinsmann a great team , " said hitzfeld .
" this team is capable of mixing it right at the top again next season . "

" the team has achieved great things and we 're very satisfied . "
bayern splashed out last summer by recruiting the likes of italian world cup winner luca toni , french midfielder franck ribery and germany striker miroslav klose .
the team has won the german cup , german league cup and now the bundesliga title this season - only the uefa cup eluded them .
" i think bayern deserve the title , " said club president franz beckenbauer .

the east 's era of swollen employment came to an abrupt end when the economic shock of reunification impacted on its labor market shortly afterwards .
vast numbers of workers in jena and in neighboring leipzig , dresden , and chemnitz were axed as traditional communist markets in eastern europe crumbled , and companies went bust .
there were fears jena would suffer the fate of other eastern industrial centers where firms were snapped up by western competitors at low cost , then downsized or even shut down .
not until lothar spaeth , a canny former premier of the western state of baden-wuerttemberg , arrived in jena did an economic turn- around take place .
jenoptik became the successor firm of carl zeiss and spaeth its chief executive .
he allowed former carl zeiss employees to use the firm 's facilities to create their own companies , spawning a flood of new start-ups in the 1990s .

enterprises like zeiss , jenoptik , schott jenauer glas and jenapharm helped consolidate the region 's ailing economy .
the introduction of new technologies added to jena 's high-tech company attractiveness .
dr michael mertin , jenoptik 's chairman , talks of the city 's " unique cooperation between economy and science . "
chatting with a group of journalists recently , he said the company had restructured its business into five divisions covering optics , lasers , defense systems , traffic solutions and industrial metrology .
with 130 apprentices and 600 of its 3,500 staff engaged in research and development , jenoptik aims to be a 1-billion-euro group soon , he said .
in 2006 , the company entered the traffic service market in north america , developing systems to monitor infrastructure , issue citations for traffic violations and collect fines .
" now , with a presence in more than 60 countries , jenoptik is easily the global market leader in photographic traffic monitoring , " mertin said .
last year , the company achieved a turnover of 520 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- , some 60 per cent of which was derived from abroad .
business and cultural center today , jena is a melting pot of business enterprises and cultural activity - a place to carry out research , create patents and conduct business as well as to " write , play , compose and philosophize , " say marketing experts .

the us project was delayed by years of wrangling with the city of berlin over buffer zones to foil car bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a throwback to 1980s post-modernism ?
lines of waist-high pillars are the most obvious security features around the four-storey sandstone building , which has its longest frontage not on the square but on a four-lane road , which is where most tourists in buses will see it first . the embassy web site says the design is intended to " provide an open yet secure presentation of america . "
great view - for the ambassador from the penthouse , us ambassador william timken will have a panorama of berlin history all around him . the view has been carefully composed to show the quadriga horses on top of the brandenburg gate seeming to ride across the embassy 's rooftop garden of native american grasses .
timken will also have a close-up view of the dome on the reichstag and the tiergarten park .
to the south , the embassy faces the somber holocaust memorial , with the office towers of potsdamer platz , 400 meters -lrb- a quarter of a mile -rrb- away .
timken remembers standing on the site as a visitor to germany in the early 1990s when it was weed-covered wasteland . " the berlin wall had stood there just a short time before with the ' death strip ' next to it , " said timken , who arrived as ambassador in 2005 .
" i could n't have imagined it as the site for our embassy . "
he spoke of his " wonder " at the embassy 's return to the historic site .
security before aesthetics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timken -lrb- right -rrb- has defended the building much about the building 's design seems influenced by security needs rather than such emotions : the walls are reinforced , the glass bomb-proof , and a strong fence separates the site from the main road where visitors to the consular office enter the building . the security is part of the price the united states has paid since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . but compared to the old us embassy in berlin , which is isolated behind ugly concrete and steel barriers with gun-toting guards , the airy , $ 120-million -lrb- 78-million euro -rrb- new embassy with its many windows seems like a project in disarmament .
dated , 1980s design , say critics but architecture critic gerwin zohlen is unimpressed .
he partly called the newly unveiled exterior " boring " and a " rather uninspired " example of 1980s post-modernism that was already out of date . he suggested berliners nickname the building by california architects moore ruble yudell the " pancake , " in reference to the main-road side that tourists will pass on their way to the holocaust memorial . " it gives the impression of being horizontally stretched out , " he told dpa news agency . instead of projecting the grandeur of a superpower , the building suggested a nation that had given up being world policeman and withdrawn into self-defense , zohlen said . " it would look okay in the us midwest .
but it does n't suit an inner city in ' old europe . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a segment of the berlin wall is on display in the embassy 's courtyard zohlen said the stonework was shoddy and the building looked " cheap , " a view that has a basis in fact , since the us congress pared back the construction budget by $ 60 million compared to the original proposal . he called the building " bunker-style , " a charge also lobbed at the french embassy , which opened across the square in 2003 . ambassador timken , however , spoke out in defense of the building 's security features before the scaffolding came down , saying it was the price of building on the inner-city site . it would have been easy to build a compound with an ample buffer zone well away from the city center , but the diplomats had wanted to be " part of germany " at the heart of berlin .
berlin makes concessions the city wanted that too , and made some concessions so the project could go ahead .
ebertstrasse , which separates the embassy from the park , was slightly realigned so the buffer zone would be wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french embassy in any case , the us mission is not the only embassy fixated on security .
the british embassy ensured that berlin closed its street to all traffic . the us link to pariser platz goes back to the early 1930s when the united states bought a fire-gutted palace there , but could not restore it at first because of the great depression . when adolf hitler came to power , the us embassy was in rented premises . the embassy finally moved to pariser platz as hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , was drawing up grandiose plans to rip down the old diplomatic quarter of berlin and put a nazi showcase in its place .
germany and the united states went to war in 1941 . the postwar communist authorities ripped down the ruins , but the land remained us property and was recovered after the communist system collapsed in 1989 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jimmy mizen , 16 , suffered neck injuries in the attack at the three cooks bakery on burnt ash hill in lewisham .
it is believed that the suspect became angry after being asked to leave the premises and attacked jimmy who had tried to intervene .
tributes have been paid to the victim , the 13th teenager to be killed in london since the start of the year .
neighbour catherine busby , 87 , who has known jimmy 's family for 30 years , said the youngster had planned to cut her grass on sunday .
" he was a beautiful boy , they 're a beautiful family .
they 're all in terrible shock , " she said .
it is believed jimmy was a pupil at st thomas more catholic comprehensive in eltham .
al patel , who works at lee pharmacy next door to the bakery , said the suspect had become aggravated after being asked to leave the shop and had smashed the window with a sign .
mr patel said : " it 's sad , it 's a real tragedy .
i really feel for the parents . "
' another tragic incident ' eyewitness matthew fletcher , who lives nearby , said he saw " a boy in his early twenties " smashing the shop and " kicking it through " .
" he 's forced his way into the shop , run behind the counter and was hitting somebody with the sign , " he said .
detective chief inspector cliff lyons , from the metropolitan police , said : " this is another tragic incident where a young victim has lost his life , and our sympathies are with his family and friends .
" there was an argument between jimmy and the suspect , following which jimmy was assaulted and he sustained serious neck injuries .

the increased media interest in her has meant that writing a full novel was next to impossible , she told radio 4 's front row .
lessing , 88 , also said she would probably now be giving up writing novels altogether .
her latest book is the partly fictional memoir entitled alfred and emily .
since her nobel win she has been constantly in demand , she said .
" all i do is give interviews and spend time being photographed . "
speaking about her writing , she said : " it has stopped , i do n't have any energy any more .

her best known works include the golden notebook and the good terrorist .

she also recalled that , in the 1960s , she had been informed that the nobel academy 's judges did not like her and she would never win .
ill-health prevented her from attending the prize ceremony in stockholm , sweden .

lessing was born in iran and moved to rhodesia - now zimbabwe - as a child before settling in england in 1949 .
her debut novel the grass is singing was published the following year .
altogether she has written more than 50 novels , plays , memoirs and collections of short stories .

the increased media interest in her has meant that writing a full novel was next to impossible , she told radio 4 's front row .
lessing , 88 , also said she would probably now be giving up writing novels altogether .
her latest book is the partly fictional memoir entitled alfred and emily .
since her nobel win she has been constantly in demand , she said .
" all i do is give interviews and spend time being photographed . "
speaking about her writing , she said : " it has stopped , i do n't have any energy any more .
" this is why i keep telling anyone younger than me , do n't imagine you 'll have it forever .
" use it while you 've got it because it 'll go , it 's sliding away like water down a plughole . "
lessing is the 11th woman to win the nobel prize for literature in its 106-year history .
her best known works include the golden notebook and the good terrorist .
' long deserved ' " thank you does not seem enough when you 've won the best of them all .
it is astonishing and amazing , " she said at the time of winning .
she also recalled that , in the 1960s , she had been informed that the nobel academy 's judges did not like her and she would never win .
ill-health prevented her from attending the prize ceremony in stockholm , sweden .
instead the swedish ambassador to london , staffan carlsson , presented the award to her in the uk .
he told her she was being " crowned with a prize you have long deserved " .
lessing was born in iran and moved to rhodesia - now zimbabwe - as a child before settling in england in 1949 .
her debut novel the grass is singing was published the following year .
altogether she has written more than 50 novels , plays , memoirs and collections of short stories .
the golden notebook is considered by many to be a feminist classic , though lessing has distanced herself from the movement .

health experts predict the ageing population means state funding for the care of the elderly and disabled will face a huge shortfall within 20 years .
the warnings come as ministers are about to begin a major consultation on how social care is funded .
currently , most people in england have to pay for home help themselves .
' unfair system ' state support is means-tested and most people have to pay for any home help , including washing , dressing , cooking , themselves .
health ministers say they are aware of a widespread feeling that this system is unfair .
also , rapidly growing demand means social care is already being heavily rationed and ministers predict that is set to worsen .

paul cheesman on the social care he receives within 20 years a quarter of the adult population will be over 65 and the numbers over 85 will have doubled .
it is expected over two million extra people will need care by the middle of the century .
but state funding for social care currently grows at a much slower rate than the population explosion among older people demands .
this means we are heading for a funding gap of £ 6bn within two decades unless the system is changed .
this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general care services minister ivan lewis and that is what ministers have promised to do .
they believe a new care system for the 21st century is needed and say they want a radical rethink .
on monday , they will start a public consultation asking how the state , families and taxpayers should share the costs of this increasingly important service .
share views care services minister ivan lewis insists there are no easy answers .
he told bbc news : " this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general .
" together we have to decide what quality and level of care services we have a right to expect in a civilised society .
" and what we need is to move towards a system which is fairer ; where people feel it 's fair in terms of what is expected of them and also in terms of what the government can pay and what is affordable . "
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said the cost of social care had to be shared between individuals and the state .
" we had previously argued for free personal care but any policy you come up with has to be sustainable , " he said .
" we would inject an extra £ 2bn into care for elderly people and use that as a mechanism to increase the quality of care for people and to scrap this pernicious means-tested system . "
the government consultation will last six months and include a number of so-called listening events around england where people interested in modernising the social care system can share their views .
eventually the government will set out proposals for reform in a green paper .
one option certain to be ruled out is making social care free .
it happens in scotland , but proved so costly there has been rationing .

paul cheesman on the social care he receives within 20 years a quarter of the adult population will be over 65 and the numbers over 85 will have doubled .
it is expected over two million extra people will need care by the middle of the century .
but state funding for social care currently grows at a much slower rate than the population explosion among older people demands .
this means we are heading for a funding gap of £ 6bn within two decades unless the system is changed .
this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general care services minister ivan lewis and that is what ministers have promised to do .
they believe a new care system for the 21st century is needed and say they want a radical rethink .
on monday , they will start a public consultation asking how the state , families and taxpayers should share the costs of this increasingly important service .
share views care services minister ivan lewis insists there are no easy answers .
he told bbc news : " this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general .
" together we have to decide what quality and level of care services we have a right to expect in a civilised society .
" and what we need is to move towards a system which is fairer ; where people feel it 's fair in terms of what is expected of them and also in terms of what the government can pay and what is affordable . "
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said the cost of social care had to be shared between individuals and the state .
" we had previously argued for free personal care but any policy you come up with has to be sustainable , " he said .
" we would inject an extra £ 2bn into care for elderly people and use that as a mechanism to increase the quality of care for people and to scrap this pernicious means-tested system . "
the government consultation will last six months and include a number of so-called listening events around england where people interested in modernising the social care system can share their views .
eventually the government will set out proposals for reform in a green paper .
one option certain to be ruled out is making social care free .
it happens in scotland , but proved so costly there has been rationing .
another option not on the table is the status quo - everyone seems clear , when it comes to caring for the elderly and disabled , things can not go on as they are .

health experts predict the ageing population means state funding for the care of the elderly and disabled will face a huge shortfall within 20 years .
the warnings come as ministers are about to begin a major consultation on how social care is funded .
currently , most people in england have to pay for home help themselves .
' unfair system ' state support is means-tested and most people have to pay for any home help , including washing , dressing , cooking , themselves .
health ministers say they are aware of a widespread feeling that this system is unfair .
also , rapidly growing demand means social care is already being heavily rationed and ministers predict that is set to worsen .

paul cheesman on the social care he receives within 20 years a quarter of the adult population will be over 65 and the numbers over 85 will have doubled .
it is expected over two million extra people will need care by the middle of the century .
but state funding for social care currently grows at a much slower rate than the population explosion among older people demands .
this means we are heading for a funding gap of £ 6bn within two decades unless the system is changed .
this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general care services minister ivan lewis and that is what ministers have promised to do .
they believe a new care system for the 21st century is needed and say they want a radical rethink .
on monday , they will start a public consultation asking how the state , families and taxpayers should share the costs of this increasingly important service .
share views care services minister ivan lewis insists there are no easy answers .
he told bbc news : " this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general .
" together we have to decide what quality and level of care services we have a right to expect in a civilised society .
" and what we need is to move towards a system which is fairer ; where people feel it 's fair in terms of what is expected of them and also in terms of what the government can pay and what is affordable . "
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said the cost of social care had to be shared between individuals and the state .
" we had previously argued for free personal care but any policy you come up with has to be sustainable , " he said .
" we would inject an extra £ 2bn into care for elderly people and use that as a mechanism to increase the quality of care for people and to scrap this pernicious means-tested system . "
the government consultation will last six months and include a number of so-called listening events around england where people interested in modernising the social care system can share their views .
eventually the government will set out proposals for reform in a green paper .
one option certain to be ruled out is making social care free .
it happens in scotland , but proved so costly there has been rationing .
another option not on the table is the status quo - everyone seems clear , when it comes to caring for the elderly and disabled , things can not go on as they are .

health experts predict the ageing population means state funding for the care of the elderly and disabled will face a huge shortfall within 20 years .
the warnings come as ministers are about to begin a major consultation on how social care is funded .
currently , most people in england have to pay for home help themselves .
' unfair system ' state support is means-tested and most people have to pay for any home help , including washing , dressing , cooking , themselves .
health ministers say they are aware of a widespread feeling that this system is unfair .
also , rapidly growing demand means social care is already being heavily rationed and ministers predict that is set to worsen .

paul cheesman on the social care he receives within 20 years a quarter of the adult population will be over 65 and the numbers over 85 will have doubled .
it is expected over two million extra people will need care by the middle of the century .
but state funding for social care currently grows at a much slower rate than the population explosion among older people demands .
this means we are heading for a funding gap of £ 6bn within two decades unless the system is changed .
this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general care services minister ivan lewis and that is what ministers have promised to do .
they believe a new care system for the 21st century is needed and say they want a radical rethink .
on monday , they will start a public consultation asking how the state , families and taxpayers should share the costs of this increasingly important service .
share views care services minister ivan lewis insists there are no easy answers .
he told bbc news : " this is one of the greatest challenges facing not only government but families and society in general .
" together we have to decide what quality and level of care services we have a right to expect in a civilised society .
" and what we need is to move towards a system which is fairer ; where people feel it 's fair in terms of what is expected of them and also in terms of what the government can pay and what is affordable . "
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said the cost of social care had to be shared between individuals and the state .
" we had previously argued for free personal care but any policy you come up with has to be sustainable , " he said .
" we would inject an extra £ 2bn into care for elderly people and use that as a mechanism to increase the quality of care for people and to scrap this pernicious means-tested system . "
the government consultation will last six months and include a number of so-called listening events around england where people interested in modernising the social care system can share their views .
eventually the government will set out proposals for reform in a green paper .
one option certain to be ruled out is making social care free .
it happens in scotland , but proved so costly there has been rationing .
another option not on the table is the status quo - everyone seems clear , when it comes to caring for the elderly and disabled , things can not go on as they are .
