" the tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , " bauer , told mdr radio .
" he shook a little more then there was no more movement .
he seemed pretty much gone . " my son and i were so upset because he is such a beautiful creature . " but quickly realizing this was not the moment to teach her son about darwin 's rule of survival of the fittest , she rushed to get the animal 's keeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zoo named the tiger johann after bauer 's son " there is this nice woman , who i 'd call an angel of the night , who says she knows a little about medicine and asks if she can help , " animal keeper thorsten westphal told mdr . the next thing anyone knows westphal has locked the - obviously irresponsible - mother tiger in a separate cage , and bauer is on her hands and knees above the unconscious tiger giving it the kiss of life . " we got the piece out but he was n't breathing so i massaged his heart and then i did what i would do for humans - mouth to mouth resuscitation , " she said .
" after about four he came to , thank god . " the zoo , which held a ceremony on friday , feb .
1 , to thank bauer , has decided to call the tiger johann , in honor of her son . despite the spectacular revival , and possibly due to malaysian tigers ' notoriously bad breath , bauer said she has no plans to trade her studies of human medicine for a career as a vet . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners . " about 234,000 darfur refugees , along with 179,000 displaced eastern chadians and 43,000 central africans uprooted by strife and rebellion in the north of their country , are housed in camps in the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 01.02.2008 basques hope for change despite setbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority of basques want their situation to change statehood remains an elusive goal for basque nationalists .
yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

serbians said they will do everything the can to prevent kosovar independence . steinmeier said the 27 eu members were preparing for a decision on independence by the leaders of the breakaway serbian republic . " it does not take much fantasy to guess what the decision would be , " steinmeier said on friday , feb .
1 , after talks in berlin with his swedish counterpart carl bildt , a former eu mediator for bosnia . the civilian mission will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and justice experts , one diplomat told the afp news agency . the launch of the mission , which requires unanimous support , could come quickly , depending on how events unfold in kosovo and serbia , where a second round run-off presidential election is taking place sunday . bildt said it was necessary to maintain what he described as the " semi-consensus " by eu members on kosovo , but predicted a " long period of difficulty " if kosovo goes ahead and declares independence unilaterally . discord among eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ca n't agree on a single direction when it comes to kosovo the length of the eu 's mission , expected to cost some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 296 million -rrb- in 2008 , has not been finalized .
but diplomats have regularly spoken of kosovo being under " supervised independence " for five to 10 years . the bloc has not been able to reach agreement on whether to recognize kosovo , should it declare independence .
some countries , particularly spain , are concerned a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of ethnic albanians in the serbian province would strengthen nationalist tendencies among minorities in their own nations . hashim thaci , kosovo 's recently elected prime minister , has said his government could proclaim independence within days of serbia 's presidential election on sunday . serbia 's " secret plan " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremic said serbia was not willing to part with kosovo serbia is strongly opposed to independence for the province , which is 90 percent populated by albanians , and has repeatedly said it will use all peaceful means at its disposal to protect its territorial integrity . " we will use all the diplomatic , political , economic and legal means to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country , " serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday during a visit to bratislava .
he was speaking at a joint press conference with his slovak counterpart jan kubis . jeremic added that the belgrade government had developed a " secret plan " that would be put in place if kosovo declared independence .
he would not , however , elaborate on the plan 's details . " the vast majority of serbian citizens in our southern province of kosovo will choose not to associate themselves with such a decision , " jeremic said . serbian poll could influence independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how serbians vote sunday could influence kosovo 's timeline for independence experts warn that declaring independence could trigger further conflicts , with albanians in serbia and serbs in northern kosovo and bosnia-herzegovina following suit . steinmeier and bildt renewed the eu 's offer of visa-free travel for serbs , a free trade agreement and money to help more serbs study in europe . the german minister said he was uncertain whether the offer would affect the outcome of the run-off presidential election in serbia on sunday .
in the first round of balloting , ultranationalist tomislav nikolic , a euroskeptic , won the most votes . experts in the eu expect kosovo to declare independence immediately if nikolic wins the presidential election .
a win by pro-european incumbent boris tadic , however , could delay such an announcement by 10 days , experts said . kosovo has been under united nations administration since a nato-led campaign ended violence there in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

" the tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , " bauer , told mdr radio .
" he shook a little more then there was no more movement .
he seemed pretty much gone . " my son and i were so upset because he is such a beautiful creature . " but quickly realizing this was not the moment to teach her son about darwin 's rule of survival of the fittest , she rushed to get the animal 's keeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zoo named the tiger johann after bauer 's son " there is this nice woman , who i 'd call an angel of the night , who says she knows a little about medicine and asks if she can help , " animal keeper thorsten westphal told mdr . the next thing anyone knows westphal has locked the - obviously irresponsible - mother tiger in a separate cage , and bauer is on her hands and knees above the unconscious tiger giving it the kiss of life . " we got the piece out but he was n't breathing so i massaged his heart and then i did what i would do for humans - mouth to mouth resuscitation , " she said .
" after about four he came to , thank god . " the zoo , which held a ceremony on friday , feb .
1 , to thank bauer , has decided to call the tiger johann , in honor of her son . despite the spectacular revival , and possibly due to malaysian tigers ' notoriously bad breath , bauer said she has no plans to trade her studies of human medicine for a career as a vet . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .

yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .

in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .
in an interview with berliner zeitung , tobias strunk from a specialty comic book shop called the anne frank holocaust comic book " a bit forced . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am still of the opinion that we will continue and fulfill our mandate in afghanistan , " he told reporters in berlin on friday , feb .

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .
he says the german kids are only worried about the way their hair looks .
is it really like that ? " these are drastic but important points .
he 's worried that kids are n't learning the basics .
shooting skills , inside of the foot , outside and so on and of course heading .
you have to teach kids properly .
these things are no longer done .
so he 's right . can the coach do all these things ? the coach is the key .
coaches leave lasting impressions on kids .
they decide what direction they take .
the quality of the coach decides what kind of talent we have in the future .
the problem is there are n't that many good coaches .
the coaches in the bundesliga also get better the longer they work .
sammer has stated that former germany players are not going to automatically be on the fast track to getting a coaching certificate .
you are the youngest coach to ever win the bundesliga .
you did your coaching certificate in 6 weeks .
you could n't do that today .
why not ? because it 's counterproductive .
playing football and teaching football are two different jobs .
just think about a piano player who is brilliant at playing the piano .
but can this person teach others how to play the piano .
that 's adifferent question .
you have to learn how to do it . do you think germany can recreate the spirit of 96 this summer ?
when you look at the conditions then we 're definitely in a position to say we want to win .
that 's the goal .
we do n't have to discuss it .
we have to make sure we 're prepared .
we have a lot of highly qualified people in the coaching team .
if you look at it that way then the euro has actually already started . but are they as good as in 96 ? we 'll find out at the tournament .
the squad have a lot of things going for them .
i hope that everyone is physically in the right state .
you have to be in that position to get in the right frame of mind .
there is room to improve .
i hope they can prove that this is a great team . in 2002 you said the worst thing was that you were n't able to play any more . of course that 's true .
when you think about it as a kid you grew up playing in the yard or in a club or at school .
we had the time of our lives .
playing football was fantastic .
then your hobby becomes a job and you live your emotions on the pitch and have to deal with losing .
it 's beautiful but the problem is that the players who are playing now do n't realise that when the stop it wo n't be so beautiful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .
he says the german kids are only worried about the way their hair looks .
is it really like that ? " these are drastic but important points .
he 's worried that kids are n't learning the basics .
shooting skills , inside of the foot , outside and so on and of course heading .
you have to teach kids properly .
these things are no longer done .
so he 's right . can the coach do all these things ? the coach is the key .
coaches leave lasting impressions on kids .
they decide what direction they take .
the quality of the coach decides what kind of talent we have in the future .
the problem is there are n't that many good coaches .
the coaches in the bundesliga also get better the longer they work .
sammer has stated that former germany players are not going to automatically be on the fast track to getting a coaching certificate .
you are the youngest coach to ever win the bundesliga .
you did your coaching certificate in 6 weeks .
you could n't do that today .
why not ? because it 's counterproductive .
playing football and teaching football are two different jobs .
just think about a piano player who is brilliant at playing the piano .
but can this person teach others how to play the piano .
that 's adifferent question .
you have to learn how to do it . do you think germany can recreate the spirit of 96 this summer ?
when you look at the conditions then we 're definitely in a position to say we want to win .
that 's the goal .
we do n't have to discuss it .
we have to make sure we 're prepared .
we have a lot of highly qualified people in the coaching team .
if you look at it that way then the euro has actually already started . but are they as good as in 96 ? we 'll find out at the tournament .
the squad have a lot of things going for them .
i hope that everyone is physically in the right state .
you have to be in that position to get in the right frame of mind .
there is room to improve .
i hope they can prove that this is a great team . in 2002 you said the worst thing was that you were n't able to play any more . of course that 's true .
when you think about it as a kid you grew up playing in the yard or in a club or at school .
we had the time of our lives .
playing football was fantastic .
then your hobby becomes a job and you live your emotions on the pitch and have to deal with losing .
it 's beautiful but the problem is that the players who are playing now do n't realise that when the stop it wo n't be so beautiful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 01.02.2008 basques hope for change despite setbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority of basques want their situation to change statehood remains an elusive goal for basque nationalists .
yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany refuses us request for more troops in afghanistan in an unusually direct letter to the german defense minister , the united states has demanded that germany and other european nato-members send more troops to afghanistan .

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners . " about 234,000 darfur refugees , along with 179,000 displaced eastern chadians and 43,000 central africans uprooted by strife and rebellion in the north of their country , are housed in camps in the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 01.02.2008 basques hope for change despite setbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority of basques want their situation to change statehood remains an elusive goal for basque nationalists .
yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , " bauer , told mdr radio .
" he shook a little more then there was no more movement .
he seemed pretty much gone . " my son and i were so upset because he is such a beautiful creature . " but quickly realizing this was not the moment to teach her son about darwin 's rule of survival of the fittest , she rushed to get the animal 's keeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zoo named the tiger johann after bauer 's son " there is this nice woman , who i 'd call an angel of the night , who says she knows a little about medicine and asks if she can help , " animal keeper thorsten westphal told mdr . the next thing anyone knows westphal has locked the - obviously irresponsible - mother tiger in a separate cage , and bauer is on her hands and knees above the unconscious tiger giving it the kiss of life . " we got the piece out but he was n't breathing so i massaged his heart and then i did what i would do for humans - mouth to mouth resuscitation , " she said .
" after about four he came to , thank god . " the zoo , which held a ceremony on friday , feb .
1 , to thank bauer , has decided to call the tiger johann , in honor of her son . despite the spectacular revival , and possibly due to malaysian tigers ' notoriously bad breath , bauer said she has no plans to trade her studies of human medicine for a career as a vet . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 01.02.2008 basques hope for change despite setbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority of basques want their situation to change statehood remains an elusive goal for basque nationalists .
yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners .

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .
he says the german kids are only worried about the way their hair looks .
is it really like that ? " these are drastic but important points .
he 's worried that kids are n't learning the basics .
shooting skills , inside of the foot , outside and so on and of course heading .
you have to teach kids properly .
these things are no longer done .
so he 's right . can the coach do all these things ? the coach is the key .
coaches leave lasting impressions on kids .
they decide what direction they take .
the quality of the coach decides what kind of talent we have in the future .
the problem is there are n't that many good coaches .
the coaches in the bundesliga also get better the longer they work .
sammer has stated that former germany players are not going to automatically be on the fast track to getting a coaching certificate .
you are the youngest coach to ever win the bundesliga .
you did your coaching certificate in 6 weeks .
you could n't do that today .
why not ? because it 's counterproductive .
playing football and teaching football are two different jobs .
just think about a piano player who is brilliant at playing the piano .
but can this person teach others how to play the piano .
that 's adifferent question .
you have to learn how to do it . do you think germany can recreate the spirit of 96 this summer ?
when you look at the conditions then we 're definitely in a position to say we want to win .
that 's the goal .
we do n't have to discuss it .
we have to make sure we 're prepared .
we have a lot of highly qualified people in the coaching team .
if you look at it that way then the euro has actually already started . but are they as good as in 96 ? we 'll find out at the tournament .
the squad have a lot of things going for them .
i hope that everyone is physically in the right state .
you have to be in that position to get in the right frame of mind .
there is room to improve .
i hope they can prove that this is a great team . in 2002 you said the worst thing was that you were n't able to play any more . of course that 's true .
when you think about it as a kid you grew up playing in the yard or in a club or at school .
we had the time of our lives .
playing football was fantastic .
then your hobby becomes a job and you live your emotions on the pitch and have to deal with losing .
it 's beautiful but the problem is that the players who are playing now do n't realise that when the stop it wo n't be so beautiful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbians said they will do everything the can to prevent kosovar independence . steinmeier said the 27 eu members were preparing for a decision on independence by the leaders of the breakaway serbian republic . " it does not take much fantasy to guess what the decision would be , " steinmeier said on friday , feb .
1 , after talks in berlin with his swedish counterpart carl bildt , a former eu mediator for bosnia . the civilian mission will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and justice experts , one diplomat told the afp news agency . the launch of the mission , which requires unanimous support , could come quickly , depending on how events unfold in kosovo and serbia , where a second round run-off presidential election is taking place sunday . bildt said it was necessary to maintain what he described as the " semi-consensus " by eu members on kosovo , but predicted a " long period of difficulty " if kosovo goes ahead and declares independence unilaterally . discord among eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ca n't agree on a single direction when it comes to kosovo the length of the eu 's mission , expected to cost some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 296 million -rrb- in 2008 , has not been finalized .
but diplomats have regularly spoken of kosovo being under " supervised independence " for five to 10 years . the bloc has not been able to reach agreement on whether to recognize kosovo , should it declare independence .
some countries , particularly spain , are concerned a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of ethnic albanians in the serbian province would strengthen nationalist tendencies among minorities in their own nations . hashim thaci , kosovo 's recently elected prime minister , has said his government could proclaim independence within days of serbia 's presidential election on sunday . serbia 's " secret plan " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremic said serbia was not willing to part with kosovo serbia is strongly opposed to independence for the province , which is 90 percent populated by albanians , and has repeatedly said it will use all peaceful means at its disposal to protect its territorial integrity . " we will use all the diplomatic , political , economic and legal means to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country , " serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday during a visit to bratislava .
he was speaking at a joint press conference with his slovak counterpart jan kubis . jeremic added that the belgrade government had developed a " secret plan " that would be put in place if kosovo declared independence .
he would not , however , elaborate on the plan 's details . " the vast majority of serbian citizens in our southern province of kosovo will choose not to associate themselves with such a decision , " jeremic said . serbian poll could influence independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how serbians vote sunday could influence kosovo 's timeline for independence experts warn that declaring independence could trigger further conflicts , with albanians in serbia and serbs in northern kosovo and bosnia-herzegovina following suit . steinmeier and bildt renewed the eu 's offer of visa-free travel for serbs , a free trade agreement and money to help more serbs study in europe . the german minister said he was uncertain whether the offer would affect the outcome of the run-off presidential election in serbia on sunday .
in the first round of balloting , ultranationalist tomislav nikolic , a euroskeptic , won the most votes . experts in the eu expect kosovo to declare independence immediately if nikolic wins the presidential election .
a win by pro-european incumbent boris tadic , however , could delay such an announcement by 10 days , experts said . kosovo has been under united nations administration since a nato-led campaign ended violence there in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners . " about 234,000 darfur refugees , along with 179,000 displaced eastern chadians and 43,000 central africans uprooted by strife and rebellion in the north of their country , are housed in camps in the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state .

it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?

none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it does not take much fantasy to guess what the decision would be , " steinmeier said on friday , feb .
1 , after talks in berlin with his swedish counterpart carl bildt , a former eu mediator for bosnia . the civilian mission will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and justice experts , one diplomat told the afp news agency . the launch of the mission , which requires unanimous support , could come quickly , depending on how events unfold in kosovo and serbia , where a second round run-off presidential election is taking place sunday . bildt said it was necessary to maintain what he described as the " semi-consensus " by eu members on kosovo , but predicted a " long period of difficulty " if kosovo goes ahead and declares independence unilaterally . discord among eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ca n't agree on a single direction when it comes to kosovo the length of the eu 's mission , expected to cost some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 296 million -rrb- in 2008 , has not been finalized .
but diplomats have regularly spoken of kosovo being under " supervised independence " for five to 10 years . the bloc has not been able to reach agreement on whether to recognize kosovo , should it declare independence .
some countries , particularly spain , are concerned a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of ethnic albanians in the serbian province would strengthen nationalist tendencies among minorities in their own nations . hashim thaci , kosovo 's recently elected prime minister , has said his government could proclaim independence within days of serbia 's presidential election on sunday . serbia 's " secret plan " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremic said serbia was not willing to part with kosovo serbia is strongly opposed to independence for the province , which is 90 percent populated by albanians , and has repeatedly said it will use all peaceful means at its disposal to protect its territorial integrity . " we will use all the diplomatic , political , economic and legal means to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country , " serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic said on friday during a visit to bratislava .
he was speaking at a joint press conference with his slovak counterpart jan kubis . jeremic added that the belgrade government had developed a " secret plan " that would be put in place if kosovo declared independence .
he would not , however , elaborate on the plan 's details . " the vast majority of serbian citizens in our southern province of kosovo will choose not to associate themselves with such a decision , " jeremic said . serbian poll could influence independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how serbians vote sunday could influence kosovo 's timeline for independence experts warn that declaring independence could trigger further conflicts , with albanians in serbia and serbs in northern kosovo and bosnia-herzegovina following suit . steinmeier and bildt renewed the eu 's offer of visa-free travel for serbs , a free trade agreement and money to help more serbs study in europe . the german minister said he was uncertain whether the offer would affect the outcome of the run-off presidential election in serbia on sunday .
in the first round of balloting , ultranationalist tomislav nikolic , a euroskeptic , won the most votes . experts in the eu expect kosovo to declare independence immediately if nikolic wins the presidential election .
a win by pro-european incumbent boris tadic , however , could delay such an announcement by 10 days , experts said . kosovo has been under united nations administration since a nato-led campaign ended violence there in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking at a joint press conference with his slovak counterpart jan kubis . jeremic added that the belgrade government had developed a " secret plan " that would be put in place if kosovo declared independence .
he would not , however , elaborate on the plan 's details . " the vast majority of serbian citizens in our southern province of kosovo will choose not to associate themselves with such a decision , " jeremic said . serbian poll could influence independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how serbians vote sunday could influence kosovo 's timeline for independence experts warn that declaring independence could trigger further conflicts , with albanians in serbia and serbs in northern kosovo and bosnia-herzegovina following suit . steinmeier and bildt renewed the eu 's offer of visa-free travel for serbs , a free trade agreement and money to help more serbs study in europe . the german minister said he was uncertain whether the offer would affect the outcome of the run-off presidential election in serbia on sunday .
in the first round of balloting , ultranationalist tomislav nikolic , a euroskeptic , won the most votes . experts in the eu expect kosovo to declare independence immediately if nikolic wins the presidential election .
a win by pro-european incumbent boris tadic , however , could delay such an announcement by 10 days , experts said . kosovo has been under united nations administration since a nato-led campaign ended violence there in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .

" the tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , " bauer , told mdr radio .
" he shook a little more then there was no more movement .
he seemed pretty much gone . " my son and i were so upset because he is such a beautiful creature . " but quickly realizing this was not the moment to teach her son about darwin 's rule of survival of the fittest , she rushed to get the animal 's keeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zoo named the tiger johann after bauer 's son " there is this nice woman , who i 'd call an angel of the night , who says she knows a little about medicine and asks if she can help , " animal keeper thorsten westphal told mdr . the next thing anyone knows westphal has locked the - obviously irresponsible - mother tiger in a separate cage , and bauer is on her hands and knees above the unconscious tiger giving it the kiss of life . " we got the piece out but he was n't breathing so i massaged his heart and then i did what i would do for humans - mouth to mouth resuscitation , " she said .
" after about four he came to , thank god . " the zoo , which held a ceremony on friday , feb .
1 , to thank bauer , has decided to call the tiger johann , in honor of her son . despite the spectacular revival , and possibly due to malaysian tigers ' notoriously bad breath , bauer said she has no plans to trade her studies of human medicine for a career as a vet . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour . " the french commander of eufor on the ground in chad , gen. jean-philippe ganascia , said he was unconcerned by the rebels " unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians , or the non-governmental organizations , or un personnel . " but he warned that if the rebels confront the eu force " believe me , i will face them down . " fighting approaches capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundredes of thousands have been displaced chad 's former colonial power , france has already flown a 126-man strong combat unit to chad .
the unit joins the 1,100 troops permanently stationed there , 950 of whom are in the capital with the remaining 150 in abeche , where eufor will also set up its base . citing rebel and military sources , france inter radio said intense battles broke out at mid-morning at massaguet , some 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- north-east of n 'djamena after a column of rebel soldiers crossed the entire country in a matter of days . the head of one of the three main rebel groups , timan erdimi , has given chadian president idriss deby until later friday to open negotiations on power-sharing or there would be a full-blown war , according to the web site of the weekly le nouvel observateur . " even if we 're at the gates of the palace , we 're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power , " erdimi told radio france international , adding that rebels has taken up positions around the capital . un evacuates staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the un 's employees in eastern chad have left as a result of the fighting , the united nations refugee agency unhcr said friday it had evacuated most of its staff from the area of guereda in eastern chad . the unhcr team in the area said it had experienced several attacks in 72 hours , with gunmen in military uniforms breaking into its compound and threatening the guards with guns . " if humanitarian workers are not around , it is impossible to provide adequate protection to the refugees , " said jorge holly , head of the unhcr field office in guereda .
" but the situation here is getting out of control and we also have to protect our staff and partners . " about 234,000 darfur refugees , along with 179,000 displaced eastern chadians and 43,000 central africans uprooted by strife and rebellion in the north of their country , are housed in camps in the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , " bauer , told mdr radio .
" he shook a little more then there was no more movement .
he seemed pretty much gone . " my son and i were so upset because he is such a beautiful creature . " but quickly realizing this was not the moment to teach her son about darwin 's rule of survival of the fittest , she rushed to get the animal 's keeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zoo named the tiger johann after bauer 's son " there is this nice woman , who i 'd call an angel of the night , who says she knows a little about medicine and asks if she can help , " animal keeper thorsten westphal told mdr . the next thing anyone knows westphal has locked the - obviously irresponsible - mother tiger in a separate cage , and bauer is on her hands and knees above the unconscious tiger giving it the kiss of life . " we got the piece out but he was n't breathing so i massaged his heart and then i did what i would do for humans - mouth to mouth resuscitation , " she said .
" after about four he came to , thank god . " the zoo , which held a ceremony on friday , feb .
1 , to thank bauer , has decided to call the tiger johann , in honor of her son . despite the spectacular revival , and possibly due to malaysian tigers ' notoriously bad breath , bauer said she has no plans to trade her studies of human medicine for a career as a vet . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .
in an interview with berliner zeitung , tobias strunk from a specialty comic book shop called the anne frank holocaust comic book " a bit forced . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .

further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .

yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .

in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am still of the opinion that we will continue and fulfill our mandate in afghanistan , " he told reporters in berlin on friday , feb .
1 . gates has insisted on 3,200 additional european troops to relieve american soldiers in afghanistan , german daily süddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday . us warns against division in nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates ' letter came unexpectedly , according to reports gates reportedly expressed concerns about the disproportionate burden on us troops in the volatile south , a possible split in the nato alliance , and a loss of credibility if reinforcements were not sent . germany currently has 3,200 soldiers , mainly in northern afghanistan and the capital city of kabul , as part of the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .

it has also sent a handful of tornado reconnaissance jets to the south to assist the nato mission . in addition , germany has been involved in training afghan police officers in the north . this week , afghan president hamid karzai told the german newspaper die welt that sending more foreign troops to his country was not as critical as training the local police and military . " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai said . the german development ministry said this week it will boost aid to the war-torn country by 1 million euros -lrb- nearly $ 1.5 million -rrb- to help counter the effects of a particularly harsh winter .

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities deny they are a danger , but environmentalists are calling for their removal and proper disposal . in 1961 , life-threatening chemical weapons left over from world war i and world war ii , were dumped in the baltic sea just eight kilometers -lrb- five miles -rrb- from the shoreline of the german town of lübeck . over the past 47 years bottles containing 20,000 liters -lrb- 5,283 gallons -rrb- of chloric gas , laughing gas and other poisonous chemicals have been pushed around by underwater currents at the bottom of the sea , making the exact current location of the bottles anyone 's guess . contesting the facts oceanographer and ammunitions expert stefan nehring , called this week , for authorities to recover the bottles from the seabed , before a chemical disaster happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects for sea life would be catastrophic if the containers leak " if one of these bottles breaks , thousands of liters of chloric gas will be released into the ocean , which could kill anyone in the immediate surroundings , " he said .
" even from a distance of 300 meters , these chemicals pose serious health risks to humans . " if the bottles break , the toxic gasses released could potentially poison the sea 's wildlife , ecosystem and fishermen at sea , as well as their catch .
experts say the bottles could also pose a threat to beach-goers , if they wash up on the coast .
environmental protectionists have called on officials to remove the toxic chemicals and dispose of them properly , but the lübeck authorities claim they have no official record of " chemical agent ammunition " being dumped in the area . the süddeutsche zeitung paper announced friday , feb .
1 , that it is in possession of official papers that document the dumping .
the paper also revealed that the authorities responsible have attempted to cover up the dumping . mission deny everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say a gas leak would put an end to tourism on germany 's baltic sea coast the department of transport has said that there is no proof or documentation of any dumping of chemical ammunition in the lübeck bay .
by classifying the gasses in question as " chemicals " instead of " chemical ammunition , " the department has legally avoided having to document or declare the dumping . however in july of 2007 , after being prodded by citizens ' groups and environmental activists , lübeck 's environmental minister thorsten geissler gave a statement to the press that implied the dumping had indeed occurred .
" the chemical agents disposed of do not pose a threat to germany 's coastal waters or to the environment , " he said .
" to salvage them in a recovery effort would be more of a contamination risk then simply leaving them on the sea bed . "
all is revealed as the story made a return to the limelight this week with a public symposium on the matter , the department of transport refused to comment on the issue until they have re-examined their records . at the symposium , oceanographer nehring said the lübeck chemical weapons dumping is not a singular case .
he claims there is evidence that more containers of chemical weapons out there , drifting dangerously in the coastal waters off the german coast . " the poison gas has to be located and disposed of , " michaela blunk , a member of the local free-market fdp party , told the süddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- lmd -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings .

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .
he says the german kids are only worried about the way their hair looks .
is it really like that ? " these are drastic but important points .
he 's worried that kids are n't learning the basics .
shooting skills , inside of the foot , outside and so on and of course heading .
you have to teach kids properly .
these things are no longer done .
so he 's right . can the coach do all these things ? the coach is the key .
coaches leave lasting impressions on kids .
they decide what direction they take .
the quality of the coach decides what kind of talent we have in the future .
the problem is there are n't that many good coaches .
the coaches in the bundesliga also get better the longer they work .
sammer has stated that former germany players are not going to automatically be on the fast track to getting a coaching certificate .
you are the youngest coach to ever win the bundesliga .
you did your coaching certificate in 6 weeks .
you could n't do that today .
why not ? because it 's counterproductive .
playing football and teaching football are two different jobs .
just think about a piano player who is brilliant at playing the piano .
but can this person teach others how to play the piano .
that 's adifferent question .
you have to learn how to do it . do you think germany can recreate the spirit of 96 this summer ?
when you look at the conditions then we 're definitely in a position to say we want to win .
that 's the goal .
we do n't have to discuss it .
we have to make sure we 're prepared .
we have a lot of highly qualified people in the coaching team .
if you look at it that way then the euro has actually already started . but are they as good as in 96 ? we 'll find out at the tournament .
the squad have a lot of things going for them .
i hope that everyone is physically in the right state .
you have to be in that position to get in the right frame of mind .
there is room to improve .
i hope they can prove that this is a great team . in 2002 you said the worst thing was that you were n't able to play any more . of course that 's true .
when you think about it as a kid you grew up playing in the yard or in a club or at school .
we had the time of our lives .
playing football was fantastic .
then your hobby becomes a job and you live your emotions on the pitch and have to deal with losing .
it 's beautiful but the problem is that the players who are playing now do n't realise that when the stop it wo n't be so beautiful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .

only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .

" more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai said . the german development ministry said this week it will boost aid to the war-torn country by 1 million euros -lrb- nearly $ 1.5 million -rrb- to help counter the effects of a particularly harsh winter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.02.2008 opinion : afghan peace only possible with more foreign aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has poured plenty into afghanistan with little result , but the country needs even more to attain peace , writes dw 's peter philipp .
only then can it avoid becoming a " failed state . " what should be done about afghanistan ?
none of the participants at the afghanistan conference in bonn in fall 2001 could have imagined that , six years later , this question would become more acute than ever before and that the situation would be getting worse every day - even though the taliban regime has been overthrown , al qaeda has been dislodged , elections have taken place and the first democratic structures have been put in place . the taliban has tried for a long time to return and the americans , brits and other nato troops are engaged more and more frequently in hostilities with them . and now this : american think-tanks are saying that afghanistan is becoming a " forgotten war " and that it will soon have to be labeled as a " failed state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp over the course of its eventful history , afghanistan has hardly been anything else - in part because the central authority of its kings and presidents rarely reached beyond kabul and was always reliant on alliances with regional rulers .
it was possible to displace the taliban but not to overturn these long-standing structures . afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has had to make arrangements with war lords in order to underline his claim to power .
he has to put up with their corruption and drug trade and can not let his dependence on foreign states show too much .
after all , the foreigners want to pare down the power of the regional rulers .
those from abroad are increasingly seen as occupiers and enemies , while the taliban is viewed through rose-colored glasses . this perception does n't exactly encourage the international community to send more troops to afghanistan , which is what the us and nato are asking for .
a growing number of countries are pulling out and germany would be a rare exception if indeed it does decide to send a small contingent of combat troops to the generally peaceful northern region . but germany wo n't be able to change the course of things .
essentially , everyone - foreigners as well as karzai - agree that afghanistan needs more than it 's gotten so far .
more troops , more education , more jobs , more freedom , more democracy . many were prepared to offer this kind of help before , but their readiness flagged in the face of constant setbacks .
the country has shown itself to be a bottomless barrel when it comes to foreign assistance . is that a reason to give up on afghanistan ?
of course not .
the majority of afghans hope for peace , which is only possible with help from abroad - not just with fighter jets , but with help across the board and with strong partners in kabul .
otherwise the bleak prediction of a failed state will come true after all . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour .

the un has evacuated most its staff . already months after its hoped-for deployment date , a european peacekeeping force destined for chad has , once again , been delayed , but politicians and military leaders say they hope soldiers and equipment will begin reaching the african country soon . but a high-ranking african union official told the afp news agency that the fighting could have a serious impact on the force 's deployment to chad . " this attack means that everything is up in the air , " said the official , who declined to be identified . eufor , as the eu 's mission is called , is tasked with protecting civilians and refugees fleeing the war-torn sudanese province of darfur but its leaders decide in favor of a temporary delay in sending troops to n 'djamena . planes grounded until instability ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : additional european troops wo n't be in chad for a few days " the planes will not leave as long as the instability continues , but this does not mean it will last a long time , " lt. col. philippe de cussac , a spokesman for the eu mission at its french headquarters , told the afp news agency . some 60 soldiers were scheduled to depart friday as part of the mission 's advance team .
the eu agreed to deploy a total of 3,700 soldiers , with most coming from france , to the region . " at the moment we do n't want to blow this out of proportion , but yes , a flight of irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed , " an eu spokesman said in brussels , adding that the situation would be monitored " hour by hour .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .
in an interview with berliner zeitung , tobias strunk from a specialty comic book shop called the anne frank holocaust comic book " a bit forced . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .

further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .

some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .

he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .

kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .

in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .

further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .

yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .

in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .

further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .

yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .
" but we are on an irreversible road to peace . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu appeals to the russian federation to remove the restrictions on odihr 's observation mission for the presidential elections , " said a statement released in vienna in the name of eu president slovenia .
" we hope that all practical arrangements such as the issuing of visas will be facilitated expeditiously and that observers will be given unfettered access to the remaining electoral process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small team of council of europe and osce members observed the duma elections the odihr , which boycotted december parliamentary elections in russia after a visa row , said it would consider cancelling its mission if the restrictions were not lifted . " it 's absolutely impossible to observe that if we can only arrive three days before the election , " said curtis budden , an odihr spokesman .
" we have a mandate to do long-term observation .
an election is not just what happens on election day . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , after speaking to the osce permanent council in vienna , later confirmed that the odihr 's invitation to attend the elections had been delayed and when it arrived it included a number of significant restrictions . ferrero-waldner said she hoped that the russian authorities would be " flexible enough " to allow the odihr to monitor the poll under the original conditions , which would allow the observers to be present in russia longer than period included in the invitation .
russia was reported to have invited the monitors to the country just three days ahead of the elections , odihr said . fragile state of relations promote caution there are doubts that the european union will significantly increase its pressure on russia in the coming days .
the eu is having to choose its words carefully in the run-up to the election in an attempt to avoid antagonizing russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner : " can the rest of you please speak up " in recent days europe 's leaders have been strikingly silent , with only ferrero-waldner and nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer making cautious statements that they hoped the election could be observed according to usual rules . " there is a sense that whatever we say it will not make any difference , " katinka barysch of the london-based centre for european reform think tank told reuters .
" we need to have a functioning relationship with the leadership , old or new ...
we do n't want to antagonize them too much . " meanwhile , in russia , activities which would normally cause harsh criticism if they were happening anywhere else in the world have gone largely uncommented on . state control of media continues president vladimir putin 's chosen successor , dmitry medvedev , is far ahead of rivals and assisted by blanket coverage from state media and his refusal to hold television debates with rivals .
in addition , former prime minister and kremlin critic mikhail kasyanov has been barred from running in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's chosen successor , medvedev has n't had problems getting media coverage some critics of europe 's handling of russia in the run-up to the elections have noted that the eu has recently adopted a policy based on mutual interests in place of its previous values-based approach . as a result , russia holds many of the cards when it comes to dealing with the eu , a situation which has forced the bloc to avoid harsh words on russia 's democracy record at recent bilateral meetings . " it seems european governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " said kenneth roth , head of human rights watch thursday as the watchdog released its annual report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .

serbians said they will do everything the can to prevent kosovar independence . steinmeier said the 27 eu members were preparing for a decision on independence by the leaders of the breakaway serbian republic . " it does not take much fantasy to guess what the decision would be , " steinmeier said on friday , feb .
1 , after talks in berlin with his swedish counterpart carl bildt , a former eu mediator for bosnia . the civilian mission will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and justice experts , one diplomat told the afp news agency . the launch of the mission , which requires unanimous support , could come quickly , depending on how events unfold in kosovo and serbia , where a second round run-off presidential election is taking place sunday . bildt said it was necessary to maintain what he described as the " semi-consensus " by eu members on kosovo , but predicted a " long period of difficulty " if kosovo goes ahead and declares independence unilaterally . discord among eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ca n't agree on a single direction when it comes to kosovo the length of the eu 's mission , expected to cost some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 296 million -rrb- in 2008 , has not been finalized .

in 1996 sammer won the european championship title .
now he 's the technical director of the german football association . jürgen klinsmann is taking over at bayern munich . do you think things will stay the same ? "
i told my friends i thought klinsmann was one of the favourites .
i looked at the decision-makers and saw how important it is to find the right person for the job .
it 's not a surprise .
i also think it 's good to have a german coach at germany 's top club .
i ca n't wait to see his training methods .
he will have difficulties .
he 's never worked in the day to day life at a club .
how will he solve the problems ?
and how will he let the strong structure at bayern influence his work ?
it 's going to be interesting .
but i 'm glad we 'll have a german coach at bayern .
so you think this decision is logical ? it 's the logical consequence .
he meets the demands .
jürgen klinsmann is one of the only people that can think like the top bosses at bayern .
bayern are taking on the least possible risk with the greatest opportunity . what 's it like when you take your son to the local football pitch ? i love taking him down there , when i have time to do it .
the structures are in place for kids to play .
but sometimes they do n't know what they should be doing. nd they do n't know how to get organised .
street football : 3 against 3 , 4 gainst 4 , 5 against 5 has everything you need to know about football .
but they do n't play like that .
we have to encourage kids to start playing again .
we used to play football all day out on the street .
we used to organise urselves but that 's not the case today . why do n't they do it .
what 's so special about street football . we did n't encourage them enough .
that 's why we are making more football ptches . uwe seeler once told me that when he sees young kids out practicing headers they 're always from other countries .
he says the german kids are only worried about the way their hair looks .
is it really like that ? " these are drastic but important points .
he 's worried that kids are n't learning the basics .
shooting skills , inside of the foot , outside and so on and of course heading .
you have to teach kids properly .
these things are no longer done .
so he 's right . can the coach do all these things ? the coach is the key .
coaches leave lasting impressions on kids .
they decide what direction they take .
the quality of the coach decides what kind of talent we have in the future .
the problem is there are n't that many good coaches .
the coaches in the bundesliga also get better the longer they work .
sammer has stated that former germany players are not going to automatically be on the fast track to getting a coaching certificate .
you are the youngest coach to ever win the bundesliga .
you did your coaching certificate in 6 weeks .
you could n't do that today .
why not ? because it 's counterproductive .
playing football and teaching football are two different jobs .
just think about a piano player who is brilliant at playing the piano .
but can this person teach others how to play the piano .
that 's adifferent question .
you have to learn how to do it . do you think germany can recreate the spirit of 96 this summer ?
when you look at the conditions then we 're definitely in a position to say we want to win .
that 's the goal .
we do n't have to discuss it .
we have to make sure we 're prepared .
we have a lot of highly qualified people in the coaching team .
if you look at it that way then the euro has actually already started . but are they as good as in 96 ? we 'll find out at the tournament .

i hope that everyone is physically in the right state .
you have to be in that position to get in the right frame of mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 01.02.2008 basques hope for change despite setbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority of basques want their situation to change statehood remains an elusive goal for basque nationalists .
yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .
the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

the terrorist group maintained the cease-fire was still in force , but called it of in june 2006 . since then , basque nationalism has been in a crisis , said linstroth .
basque political activists have faced judicial scrutiny and arrest for alleged ties to eta . " i think there are a lot of angry people who feel disenfranchised and caught in the middle , " linstroth said . gorka espiau is a long-time peace activist and an advisor to the basque government on current peace programs taking place in cities around the region .
he agrees that there is a certain amount of pessimism because of the return of violence . during the cease-fire , " we were very optimistic " he said .
" with the killings and bombings happening again , it creates a very depressing atmosphere for everybody .
we thought this was something we left in the past . " hope for a peaceful future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque premier ibarretxe wants a dialogue with madrid in january , eta promised " long years of conflict " in a rare interview with the basque newspaper gara .
in the same interview , eta cited kosovo and scotland as models for independence and offered them as proof that the goal of breaking away from spain is not a utopian fantasy . espiau also sees kosovo as offering hope , but for a different reason .
kosovo 's situation is very different , but it does show that the future of a nation can be negotiated .
he said the same goes for belgium and scotland . espiau said he hopes the eu will support the basque region 's effort to hold a " peace vote " that would open a dialogue with the spanish government .
for the most part , the eu has maintained that the basque problems are internal and has refrained from getting involved . paul rios , who coordinates lokarri , a group which advocates dialogue instead of violence in the basque region , said when looked at from a long-term point of view , there is reason for optimism .
he 's called the eta a dinosaur .
it 's the last violent national conflict in western europe and with the vast majority of society against eta , the group simply ca n't last much longer , he feels . " it 's one thing to say that the situation today is very complicated , " rios said .

yet there 's continued hope that they can follow the example of other european countries and find a peaceful resolution to their ongoing conflict with spain . there are plenty of reasons for basques to be optimistic about the future .
joseba azkarraga , the region 's minister for justice , employment and social security , lists a few of them : income levels in the mountainous northern corner of spain are among the highest in europe , unemployment is a low 2.5 percent and the poverty rate is 3.7 percent . and a bit farther afield , there 's kosovo , which is on the brink of declaring independence from serbia . kosovo proves that new states can form in europe , azkarraga said .
just as they cheered on montenegro 's independence after a referendum in 2006 and were buoyed by the recent success of the scottish nationalist party , basque nationalists are watching what is happening in kosovo " with respect and interest , " azkarraga said . " i am an optimist , " azkarraga said of the chances his own region has for independence from spain .
" you simply ca n't impose identities .
a lot of us consider ourselves basques and europeans only .
we are not spanish and we are not french . " search for an identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta continues to sabotage peace efforts the basque region has long been the summer destination for spain 's elite .
its crown jewel , san sebastian , is a string of white sand beaches at the foot of the pyrenees mountains . the city hosts a major international film festival each year .
further south , the industrial city of bilbao has become a cultural destination in its own right since the architecturally stunning guggenheim museum opened in 1997 . basques are incredibly proud of their heritage and have always maintained a sense of separateness from spain .
the basque language , whose origins continue to confound linguists , was outlawed during the four decade-long dictatorship of francisco franco , as were all signs of basque nationalism .
but many basques remained unhappy with the autonomous status they were handed after franco ’ s death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy . the basque separatist group , eta , has been fighting for an independent basque state in northwestern spain and southwestern france since the 1960s .
eta is considered a terrorist group by both spain and the european union and is blamed for 800 deaths . eta remains a major problem for moderate nationalists like azkarraga .
his basque solidarity party -lrb- ea -rrb- condemns violence as do the ea 's coalition partners the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- .
yet the ongoing violence has sabotaged any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the spanish and basque governments , azkarraga said . in the end , it 's basque nationalism that suffers , azkarraga said . calls for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of the banned batasuna party faces off with a police officer a recent poll showed that 60 percent of basques are unhappy with the current state of democracy in their region , despite a high level of self-government .
yet there 's no clear consensus on what they want from spain .
some basque nationalists want reform of the current status as an autonomous region .
others push for a federal system and still others advocate out-and-out independence . there is , however , general agreement among basque nationalists that the region should get a chance to decide its future for itself . the basque region 's premier , juan jose ibarretxe , has vowed to hold a " peace vote " on oct .
25 that would condemn eta and demand madrid sit down with basque political parties and talk about options for reforming the current system . both of spain 's main political parties , the socialists and the people 's party , are currently gearing up for hotly contested national elections in march .
both have been unequivocal in condemning ibarretxe 's suggestion and insist that the vote has no legal basis . return to violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a march against eta in bilbao the current political impasse is a stark contrast to the euphoria in the basque region just over a year ago .
j.p. linstroth , a leading scholar on basque issues with nova southeastern university in the us state of florida , visited the region after eta declared a permanent cease-fire in march 2006 .
he said there was a lot of optimism that the violence had ended . a few weeks after he left , eta then set a bomb off in the parking garage of madrid 's barajas airport , killing two people .

an institute in the netherlands has come up with an unconventional way to deal with germany 's dark past in the classroom - a comic book . for the past two days , thomas heppener has been besieged by calls from journalists .
ever since the director of the anne frank center in berlin unveiled plans for a comic book on the holocaust in german schools , media interest has been intense .
germany 's mass-selling bild tabloid on thursday , jan .
31 , published excerpts from the book , under the headline " hitler comic for german schools . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die suche " is a milestone publication " i 'm a bit surprised at the intense reactions the plans have sparked , " said heppener .
" of course if you hear the words ' hitler comic ' you 're going to be taken aback at first .
but if you look closer , you 'll see it 's a serious attempt to find new ways to approach history at a time when holocaust witnesses are dying out and young people are increasingly uninterested in that period . "
the plans for the unusual teaching tool come amid concerns following studies showing that post-unification german children know appallingly little about the holocaust .
there appears little interest in the increased coverage of the period in the lead up to the 75th anniversary of hitler becoming chancellor , on jan .
30 , 1933 , and youngsters seem to switch off when faced with the continuing controversy over any public mention of the nazis .
the book , a first in germany , is to be introduced in a six-month pilot program in 15 high schools in berlin and the state of north-rhine westphalia and is meant to supplement existing history lessons .
the novel , which will be accompanied by historical data and background , will also be tested in poland and hungary .
through the eyes of a fictional jewish family originally produced by the dutch-based anne frank center and titled " the search , " the book traces key events of the nazi era through the eyes of a fictional jewish family , the hechts .
sketched by dutch artist eric heuvel , who drew heavily on the style of tin tin creator herge , the story opens in 2007 with esther hecht telling her grandson daniel of her parents ' arrest by the nazis at the beginning of world war ii and their subsequent deportation to ausschwitz with a neighbor called bob .
esther manages to escape the death camp , but her parents were killed there .
daniel locates bob , who also survives auschwitz , after researching on the internet which prompts esther to begin speaking of her experiences .
the book contains sketches of hitler 's fiery speeches to the german masses , details of the infamous wannsee conference of 1941 where the nazi leader decided on the so-called " final solution , " the horrors of the gas chambers and the arbitrary brutality in concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : a scene shows bob arriving at the auschwitz concentration camp in one scene , an auschwitz inmate is shot dead on the spot for appearing on parade without a cap .
the next picture shows a shocked daniel asking : " what !
he was shot dead just for not wearing a cap ? "
a breath of fresh air ?
" the search " has already been tested on dutch schoolchildren and has been a success , according to maatje mostart , head of communications at the anne frank center in amsterdam .
a predecessor to " the search " was launched in the country in 2004 and is still used in schools across the country .
" teachers have told us that students are surprisingly quiet when reading the comic book in class .
many are really moved by it and get really interested in the subject , " said mostart .
" it 's definitely something that strikes a chord with young people . "
though the comic book is bound to stir controversy in a country where public jokes about the nazi era can get you fired and representation of any nazi regalia is forbidden by law , it may well find acceptance in classrooms .
recent studies show that germans under 20 know exceedingly little about 20th century history .
while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
history lessons in germany are mostly a combination of straight lectures and discussions , weighty textbooks , documentary films and visits to concentration camps .
the comic book might just add a breath of fresh air to a complex subject that is sometimes treated too academically , according to some .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are weary of learning about the holocaust , studies show " studies have shown that students are often weary of learning about the holocaust at school and are emotionally overwhelmed by the sometimes morally-laden teaching of the era , " said verena radkau-garcia of the georg eckert institute -lrb- gei -rrb- in braunschweig which focuses on research on international school textbooks .
" the comic book , if taught well and responsibly , can be a refreshing and interesting supplement to existing history lessons . "
" way uncool " students in germany , however , are divided about the new teaching tool .
" i think it 's about time that schools realized that graphic novels are here to stay and that they can teach a dry subject better than some dumb textbook , " a 16-year-old told private german tv station , rtl .
another teenager told the same channel that comic books were " way uncool . "
that skepticism is shared by others who question whether students , who are n't interested in history anyway , could critically read a holocaust comic book .
" it sounds a bit blunt but i think it 's dangerous if students ca n't differentiate between a holocaust comic and mickey mouse , " said henning küppers , a history teacher at a high school in stuttgart .
others point out that " the search " can hardly compare to other holocaust comics , in particular art spiegelmann 's famous " maus " which is considered a classic and a revolution in the genre .
in an interview with berliner zeitung , tobias strunk from a specialty comic book shop called the anne frank holocaust comic book " a bit forced . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hu jia , who publicises human rights abuses across china , has been accused of inciting subversion of state power .
campaigners say his arrest shows that china is not keeping its promise to improve human rights ahead of this year 's beijing olympic games .
but the government says china is a country ruled by laws , and hu jia will be dealt with according to the law .
sudden detention two days after christmas , about 30 security officers burst into hu jia 's flat and took him away .
officials were apparently tired of his efforts to support human rights cases across the country .
he had become a kind of one-man clearing house for information , passing it on to journalists , organisations and foreign embassies .
his wife zeng jinyan , also a prominent activist , has been put under house arrest with the couple 's two-month-old baby .
the bbc was not allowed to visit her when we went to the couple 's flat on the outskirts of beijing last month .
since he was detained , there has been little word about hu jia 's condition and whereabouts .
his lawyers have not been allowed to see him .
but officials have now sent his family formal notification that he has been arrested .
" after 37 days a suspect has to be either released or formally arrested .
hu jia has been arrested , " said a family friend , lawyer teng biao .
mr hu faces charges of subverting state power , a serious charge that could lead to a long prison term .
rights groups say beijing is cracking down on dissent ahead of the olympics in august .
" the preparations for the olympics are having an overall negative impact on human rights developments in china , " said sophie richardson of human rights watch .

hu jia , who publicises human rights abuses across china , has been accused of inciting subversion of state power .
campaigners say his arrest shows that china is not keeping its promise to improve human rights ahead of this year 's beijing olympic games .
but the government says china is a country ruled by laws , and hu jia will be dealt with according to the law .
sudden detention two days after christmas , about 30 security officers burst into hu jia 's flat and took him away .
officials were apparently tired of his efforts to support human rights cases across the country .
he had become a kind of one-man clearing house for information , passing it on to journalists , organisations and foreign embassies .
his wife zeng jinyan , also a prominent activist , has been put under house arrest with the couple 's two-month-old baby .
the bbc was not allowed to visit her when we went to the couple 's flat on the outskirts of beijing last month .
since he was detained , there has been little word about hu jia 's condition and whereabouts .
his lawyers have not been allowed to see him .
but officials have now sent his family formal notification that he has been arrested .
" after 37 days a suspect has to be either released or formally arrested .
hu jia has been arrested , " said a family friend , lawyer teng biao .
mr hu faces charges of subverting state power , a serious charge that could lead to a long prison term .
rights groups say beijing is cracking down on dissent ahead of the olympics in august .

but today as technology develops , there has been an expansion of murky practices like phone bugging , computer hacking and secret filming .
the range of businesses that have relied on corporate espionage is breathtakingly wide .
in the glamorous world of formula one , mclaren was fined £ 50 million for spying on rival ferrari .
a waste tycoon who bugged the phones and hacked the computers of local residents and government officials investigating his company ended up going to prison .
a builder and conservatory designer who was spied on by a larger rival lost his business and moved to spain .
secret meeting " they crushed me .
there 's no question about that " howard davies , former builder last season at a secret meeting in barcelona , the mclaren formula one team obtained a copy of the operating manual of their arch-rival ferrari .
it was just a small part of a lengthy spying operation involving a senior engineer at each team .
italian police found the two men had exchanged nearly 400 phone calls , text messages and emails in 3 months .
according to italian prosecutor guiseppe tibis the timing of these contacts was damning : .
" the frequency of the emails more or less always coincided with the grand prix races , " he said .
exposed in cranleigh the plot was finally exposed in the surrey village of cranleigh near the mclaren hq when the wife of a mclaren engineer brought the 780-page ferrari manual to a document scanning company .
the manager was suspicious and immediately phoned ferrari .
three months later the fia , formula one 's governing body decided mclaren was guilty of espionage and imposed a record £ 50m fine .
mclaren told the bbc that although it did not accept all the fia 's conclusions , it apologised wholeheartedly for its conduct and said it would do everything in its power to avoid a repetition .
however , eddie jordan , founder of jordan grand prix , is just one of many insiders who claim that spying and formula one go hand in hand .
" i think espionage has been there from day one , certainly is there now and will continue to be there .
it 's part of formula one , " he said .
conservatory design another spy story has emerged from the unlikely world of conservatory design and manufacture .
ten years ago a david-and-goliath struggle started between two lancashire firms .
builder and designer howard davies was in competition with a large company called ultraframe , then on the verge of stock market floatation .
suspecting that mr davies was infringing its patents , ultraframe sent in a private investigator who posed as a potential investor .
the bbc has obtained the transcripts of the spy 's meeting with howard davies , which reveals how mr davies inadvertently disclosed confidential financial and copyright information .
in the end ultraframe 's patent infringement claim against mr davies came to nothing , but by then he was out of the business and has spent the last decade in spain .
the money programme asked ultraframe about the espionage .
it told us it took place ' over ten years ago ' and that ' the directors involved are no longer employed by the business ' .
but for howard davies the effect has been devastating : " they crushed me .
there 's no question about that . "
corporate espionage is n't just about business to business .
it can affect ordinary people too .
blaggers mick gorrill of the information commissioner 's office , the body charged with protecting all our personal data , has focussed on a group of spies who make bogus phone calls to obtain confidential records .
they often work for law firms deciding whether to sue someone or insurance companies assessing a claim .
mr gorrill calls them blaggers .
it 's a bit like someone burglaring your house or stealing something from your car .
it 's exactly the same .
it 's your information .
and they 're not entitled to it but they take it , " he says .
sharon anderson could be described as britain 's ' queen of the blaggers ' .
in a quiet cambridgeshire town , mrs anderson and her husband ran an extraordinary blagging operation turning over £ 140,000 a year .
in her time sharon anderson conned confidential details out of lloyds bank , hsbc , natwest , barclays , coutts , british gas , bskyb and legal & general simply by phoning up and convincing someone she was entitled to the information .
in 2006 , mrs anderson and her husband were fined £ 7,500 for their data protection act crimes , offences which will soon carry punishments of up to 2 years in prison .
but according to mr gorrill , the demand is coming from major companies .
" it 's coming from companies that should know better .
we 're trying to change the attitude but it 's difficult , " he says .
espionage in the fens the programme 's final case is one where both investigators and their businessmen clients went to jail for their espionage .
it centred on the fenland village of thornhaugh where resident martin witherington found a stranger opening up an underground phone junction box .
mr witherington phoned bt but it had no record of an engineer going to the village .
the programme charts an extraordinary sequence of events in which local people started getting unusually high phone bills .
bt investigated and discovered a series of phone bugs had been installed .
at this stage it called in the police .
detective inspector kevin hyland of the metropolitan police explains how they set a trap to force the phone tapper to return to the scene of his crime .
" we deliberately damaged the devices and -lsb- hoped -rsb- that would cause this man to come back and repair the device , " he explained .
the trap paid off when known criminal michael hall returned to the area .
police were able to trace him to a london-based firm of private investigators called active investigation services .
when they raided its offices they discovered the thornhaugh connection .
detective inspector hyland says : " it soon was clear that their largest customer was a company called atlantic waste services ltd . "
atlantic waste ran a landfill site adjacent to the village of thornhaugh .
market value the company was run by adrian kirby .
at the time he hired the spies , mr kirby faced considerable opposition from a local residents ' campaign and from regulatory bodies like the environment agency .
mr kirby wanted to sell his waste company for millions of pounds .
based on court documents and police evidence , it has emerged that adrian kirby ordered the bugging of phones belonging to campaigners and government officials ; and the hacking of their computers .
steve hunt , one of the most vocal of the protestors to be bugged and hacked , says " that 's a real violation of your own space and it 's like someone 's violated your home .
it really feels like someone 's violated your home . "
after some months of painstaking investigation , police were able to gather enough evidence to charge adrian kirby .
mr kirby pleaded guilty to an espionage conspiracy and was sentenced to six months in prison .
but he kept his multi-million pound share when the company was sold .
the investigators he hired got terms ranging up to 2 years .
but it seems clear that for many companies spying is - quite simply - business by other means .

based on court documents and police evidence , it has emerged that adrian kirby ordered the bugging of phones belonging to campaigners and government officials ; and the hacking of their computers .
steve hunt , one of the most vocal of the protestors to be bugged and hacked , says " that 's a real violation of your own space and it 's like someone 's violated your home .
it really feels like someone 's violated your home . "
after some months of painstaking investigation , police were able to gather enough evidence to charge adrian kirby .
mr kirby pleaded guilty to an espionage conspiracy and was sentenced to six months in prison .
but he kept his multi-million pound share when the company was sold .
the investigators he hired got terms ranging up to 2 years .

but today as technology develops , there has been an expansion of murky practices like phone bugging , computer hacking and secret filming .
the range of businesses that have relied on corporate espionage is breathtakingly wide .
in the glamorous world of formula one , mclaren was fined £ 50 million for spying on rival ferrari .
a waste tycoon who bugged the phones and hacked the computers of local residents and government officials investigating his company ended up going to prison .
a builder and conservatory designer who was spied on by a larger rival lost his business and moved to spain .
secret meeting they crushed me .
there 's no question about that howard davies , former builder last season at a secret meeting in barcelona , the mclaren formula one team obtained a copy of the operating manual of their arch-rival ferrari .
it was just a small part of a lengthy spying operation involving a senior engineer at each team .
italian police found the two men had exchanged nearly 400 phone calls , text messages and emails in 3 months .
according to italian prosecutor guiseppe tibis the timing of these contacts was damning : .
" the frequency of the emails more or less always coincided with the grand prix races , " he said .
exposed in cranleigh the plot was finally exposed in the surrey village of cranleigh near the mclaren hq when the wife of a mclaren engineer brought the 780-page ferrari manual to a document scanning company .
the manager was suspicious and immediately phoned ferrari .
three months later the fia , formula one 's governing body decided mclaren was guilty of espionage and imposed a record £ 50m fine .
mclaren told the bbc that although it did not accept all the fia 's conclusions , it apologised wholeheartedly for its conduct and said it would do everything in its power to avoid a repetition .
however , eddie jordan , founder of jordan grand prix , is just one of many insiders who claim that spying and formula one go hand in hand .
" i think espionage has been there from day one , certainly is there now and will continue to be there .
it 's part of formula one , " he said .
conservatory design another spy story has emerged from the unlikely world of conservatory design and manufacture .
ten years ago a david-and-goliath struggle started between two lancashire firms .
builder and designer howard davies was in competition with a large company called ultraframe , then on the verge of stock market floatation .
suspecting that mr davies was infringing its patents , ultraframe sent in a private investigator who posed as a potential investor .
the bbc has obtained the transcripts of the spy 's meeting with howard davies , which reveals how mr davies inadvertently disclosed confidential financial and copyright information .
in the end ultraframe 's patent infringement claim against mr davies came to nothing , but by then he was out of the business and has spent the last decade in spain .
the money programme asked ultraframe about the espionage .
it told us it took place ' over ten years ago ' and that ' the directors involved are no longer employed by the business ' .
but for howard davies the effect has been devastating : " they crushed me .
there 's no question about that . "
corporate espionage is n't just about business to business .
it can affect ordinary people too .
blaggers mick gorrill of the information commissioner 's office , the body charged with protecting all our personal data , has focussed on a group of spies who make bogus phone calls to obtain confidential records .
they often work for law firms deciding whether to sue someone or insurance companies assessing a claim .
mr gorrill calls them blaggers .
it 's a bit like someone burglaring your house or stealing something from your car .
it 's exactly the same .
it 's your information .
and they 're not entitled to it but they take it , " he says .
sharon anderson could be described as britain 's ' queen of the blaggers ' .
in a quiet cambridgeshire town , mrs anderson and her husband ran an extraordinary blagging operation turning over £ 140,000 a year .
in her time sharon anderson conned confidential details out of lloyds bank , hsbc , natwest , barclays , coutts , british gas , bskyb and legal & general simply by phoning up and convincing someone she was entitled to the information .
in 2006 , mrs anderson and her husband were fined £ 7,500 for their data protection act crimes , offences which will soon carry punishments of up to 2 years in prison .
but according to mr gorrill , the demand is coming from major companies .
" it 's coming from companies that should know better .
we 're trying to change the attitude but it 's difficult , " he says .
espionage in the fens the programme 's final case is one where both investigators and their businessmen clients went to jail for their espionage .
it centred on the fenland village of thornhaugh where resident martin witherington found a stranger opening up an underground phone junction box .
mr witherington phoned bt but it had no record of an engineer going to the village .
the programme charts an extraordinary sequence of events in which local people started getting unusually high phone bills .
bt investigated and discovered a series of phone bugs had been installed .
at this stage it called in the police .
detective inspector kevin hyland of the metropolitan police explains how they set a trap to force the phone tapper to return to the scene of his crime .
" we deliberately damaged the devices and -lsb- hoped -rsb- that would cause this man to come back and repair the device , " he explained .
the trap paid off when known criminal michael hall returned to the area .
police were able to trace him to a london-based firm of private investigators called active investigation services .
when they raided its offices they discovered the thornhaugh connection .
detective inspector hyland says : " it soon was clear that their largest customer was a company called atlantic waste services ltd . "
atlantic waste ran a landfill site adjacent to the village of thornhaugh .
market value the company was run by adrian kirby .
at the time he hired the spies , mr kirby faced considerable opposition from a local residents ' campaign and from regulatory bodies like the environment agency .
mr kirby wanted to sell his waste company for millions of pounds .

worthy farm in somerset is a normal dairy farm - but the cows are rock fans .
chewing the cud on a glastonbury farm tour in pictures : festival farm driving up to worthy farm seems too easy .
there are no traffic jams , no super-fences , no tickets , no stewards , no security checks .
it is five months before this year 's festival , but to find the farm going about its normal , tranquil business still seems slightly strange .
the place is not filled with cider-addled fans , mud or mayhem .
only a handful of people are milling around , instead of the 175,000 who descend on the site every june .
there are no global megastars or indie bands in sight , and the only sounds are the distant roars of tractors spreading dung and thousands of starlings swarming on the pyramid stage field , where swarms of music fans are a more familiar sight .
but this is still a working farm - it has been for 150 years .
and owner michael eavis says it will be long after the festival has disappeared .
" the farm 's been here forever and the farm will go on forever , but the festival might or might not , you know what i mean ? , " mr eavis says .
festival bans metal tent pegs " i 'm always slightly tummy rumbling about the festival , there 's always something slightly frightening about it .
it might happen or it might not .
there 's so many external factors .
" not so the farm though .
the farm goes on forever . "
mr eavis hosted the first glastonbury festival on this land in 1970 , and the event has grown into britain 's biggest and best-loved summer fling .
but out of season , it is clear he is still a farmer first and foremost , and appears to have become a music mogul by accident .
" i do love the festival , i love doing it , " he says .
" it 's been 38 years now , a long time , but the basis of life here at worthy farm is really the cows and the milk production . "
mountain of wellies milking takes place between 0400-2200 seven days a week , and his 360 cows yield 10,200 litres a day .
mr eavis gave up milking 20 years ago - his staff do it now .
the farm is home to 360 milking cows and a further 200 calves he says his day now starts with 24 lengths in cold water , pointing to what looks like just another farm shed .
on peering inside , it houses a swimming pool .
" and then a hot bath and porridge and grapefruit for breakfast , " he explains .
" then the phones start ringing .
at this time of year , we 're going flat out on the farm and taking phone calls every 10 minutes about bands , who 's playing where , who 's doing what , who 's running this , who 's running that . "
there are a few signs that this is not just another farm .
one is the mountain of wellies and tent pegs that have been recovered from the land .
another is the steel structure at the bottom of one field .
it is the frame for the pyramid stage , the only permanent festival structure .
abandoned festival wellies fill two-and-a-half skips on the farm it will be covered at the start of may , when the set-up work starts in earnest and the other stages , scaffolding , marquees and toilets begin to arrive on the site in time for the end of june .
the fields themselves now look green and lush .
" just like a golf course almost , do n't they ? , " mr eavis marvels .
just seven months ago , his 500 acres were a monumental mudbath , and it took until january for the grass to grow back .
it was so bad the cows have not been allowed onto the land since last year 's quagmire .
milking bands they have stayed in their winter sheds , where they also live during the festival itself .
but mr eavis believes they do not mind the annual noise and commotion .
" they certainly milk very well anyway .
primal scream have to be one of the best milking bands , " he laughs .
" we ca n't get primal scream every year though , can we , not for the cows . "
i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm michael eavis mr eavis takes pleasure in saying milk is fetching more money than it has done for the past 10 years , and that is still his main source of income .
he pays himself rent for the use of the land from the festival coffers , he says - and that has helped keep the farm going .
" it 's why i 'm still here , i think , when a lot of the others have gone . "
now 72 , he has no desire to retire from either the farm or the festival .
" hopefully i can get another 10 years out of me , do you think ? " he says .
" cold water swimming helps .
" i love it to bits , there 's never a dull moment .
life 's been very sweet to me really , and i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm . "

it is five months before this year 's festival , but to find the farm going about its normal , tranquil business still seems slightly strange .
the place is not filled with cider-addled fans , mud or mayhem .
only a handful of people are milling around , instead of the 175,000 who descend on the site every june .
there are no global megastars or indie bands in sight , and the only sounds are the distant roars of tractors spreading dung and thousands of starlings swarming on the pyramid stage field , where swarms of music fans are a more familiar sight .
but this is still a working farm - it has been for 150 years .
and owner michael eavis says it will be long after the festival has disappeared .
" the farm 's been here forever and the farm will go on forever , but the festival might or might not , you know what i mean ? , " mr eavis says .
festival bans metal tent pegs " i 'm always slightly tummy rumbling about the festival , there 's always something slightly frightening about it .
it might happen or it might not .
there 's so many external factors .
" not so the farm though .
the farm goes on forever . "
mr eavis hosted the first glastonbury festival on this land in 1970 , and the event has grown into britain 's biggest and best-loved summer fling .
but out of season , it is clear he is still a farmer first and foremost , and appears to have become a music mogul by accident .
" i do love the festival , i love doing it , " he says .
" it 's been 38 years now , a long time , but the basis of life here at worthy farm is really the cows and the milk production . "
mountain of wellies milking takes place between 0400-2200 seven days a week , and his 360 cows yield 10,200 litres a day .
mr eavis gave up milking 20 years ago - his staff do it now .
the farm is home to 360 milking cows and a further 200 calves he says his day now starts with 24 lengths in cold water , pointing to what looks like just another farm shed .
on peering inside , it houses a swimming pool .
" and then a hot bath and porridge and grapefruit for breakfast , " he explains .
" then the phones start ringing .
at this time of year , we 're going flat out on the farm and taking phone calls every 10 minutes about bands , who 's playing where , who 's doing what , who 's running this , who 's running that . "
there are a few signs that this is not just another farm .
one is the mountain of wellies and tent pegs that have been recovered from the land .
another is the steel structure at the bottom of one field .
it is the frame for the pyramid stage , the only permanent festival structure .
abandoned festival wellies fill two-and-a-half skips on the farm it will be covered at the start of may , when the set-up work starts in earnest and the other stages , scaffolding , marquees and toilets begin to arrive on the site in time for the end of june .
the fields themselves now look green and lush .
" just like a golf course almost , do n't they ? , " mr eavis marvels .
just seven months ago , his 500 acres were a monumental mudbath , and it took until january for the grass to grow back .
it was so bad the cows have not been allowed onto the land since last year 's quagmire .
milking bands they have stayed in their winter sheds , where they also live during the festival itself .
but mr eavis believes they do not mind the annual noise and commotion .
" they certainly milk very well anyway .
primal scream have to be one of the best milking bands , " he laughs .
" we ca n't get primal scream every year though , can we , not for the cows . "
i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm michael eavis mr eavis takes pleasure in saying milk is fetching more money than it has done for the past 10 years , and that is still his main source of income .
he pays himself rent for the use of the land from the festival coffers , he says - and that has helped keep the farm going .
" it 's why i 'm still here , i think , when a lot of the others have gone . "
now 72 , he has no desire to retire from either the farm or the festival .
" hopefully i can get another 10 years out of me , do you think ? " he says .
" cold water swimming helps .
" i love it to bits , there 's never a dull moment .
life 's been very sweet to me really , and i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm . "

worthy farm in somerset is a normal dairy farm - but the cows are rock fans .
in pictures : festival farm driving up to worthy farm seems too easy .
there are no traffic jams , no super-fences , no tickets , no stewards , no security checks .
it is five months before this year 's festival , but to find the farm going about its normal , tranquil business still seems slightly strange .
the place is not filled with cider-addled fans , mud or mayhem .
only a handful of people are milling around , instead of the 175,000 who descend on the site every june .
there are no global megastars or indie bands in sight , and the only sounds are the distant roars of tractors spreading dung and thousands of starlings swarming on the pyramid stage field , where swarms of music fans are a more familiar sight .
but this is still a working farm - it has been for 150 years .
and owner michael eavis says it will be long after the festival has disappeared .
" the farm 's been here forever and the farm will go on forever , but the festival might or might not , you know what i mean ? , " mr eavis says .
festival bans metal tent pegs " i 'm always slightly tummy rumbling about the festival , there 's always something slightly frightening about it .
it might happen or it might not .
there 's so many external factors .
" not so the farm though .
the farm goes on forever . "
mr eavis hosted the first glastonbury festival on this land in 1970 , and the event has grown into britain 's biggest and best-loved summer fling .
but out of season , it is clear he is still a farmer first and foremost , and appears to have become a music mogul by accident .
" i do love the festival , i love doing it , " he says .
" it 's been 38 years now , a long time , but the basis of life here at worthy farm is really the cows and the milk production . "
mountain of wellies milking takes place between 0400-2200 seven days a week , and his 360 cows yield 10,200 litres a day .
mr eavis gave up milking 20 years ago - his staff do it now .
he says his day now starts with 24 lengths in cold water , pointing to what looks like just another farm shed .
on peering inside , it houses a swimming pool .
" and then a hot bath and porridge and grapefruit for breakfast , " he explains .
" then the phones start ringing .
at this time of year , we 're going flat out on the farm and taking phone calls every 10 minutes about bands , who 's playing where , who 's doing what , who 's running this , who 's running that . "
there are a few signs that this is not just another farm .
one is the mountain of wellies and tent pegs that have been recovered from the land .
another is the steel structure at the bottom of one field .
it is the frame for the pyramid stage , the only permanent festival structure .
it will be covered at the start of may , when the set-up work starts in earnest and the other stages , scaffolding , marquees and toilets begin to arrive on the site in time for the end of june .
the fields themselves now look green and lush .
" just like a golf course almost , do n't they ? , " mr eavis marvels .
just seven months ago , his 500 acres were a monumental mudbath , and it took until january for the grass to grow back .
it was so bad the cows have not been allowed onto the land since last year 's quagmire .
milking bands they have stayed in their winter sheds , where they also live during the festival itself .
but mr eavis believes they do not mind the annual noise and commotion .
" they certainly milk very well anyway .
primal scream have to be one of the best milking bands , " he laughs .
" we ca n't get primal scream every year though , can we , not for the cows . "
" i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm " michael eavis mr eavis takes pleasure in saying milk is fetching more money than it has done for the past 10 years , and that is still his main source of income .
he pays himself rent for the use of the land from the festival coffers , he says - and that has helped keep the farm going .
" it 's why i 'm still here , i think , when a lot of the others have gone . "
now 72 , he has no desire to retire from either the farm or the festival .
" hopefully i can get another 10 years out of me , do you think ? " he says .
" cold water swimming helps .
" i love it to bits , there 's never a dull moment .
life 's been very sweet to me really , and i 'm a very fortunate old bloke to have all this going on at the farm . "

a team from wake forest university in north carolina used imaging technology to follow the changes that take place in the brain when we scratch .
activity was reduced in areas associated with unpleasant emotions , and memories , but increased in an area associated with compulsive behaviour .
the journal of investigative dermatology study raises hopes of new treatments for itching disorders .
understanding how the process works could lead to new treatments dr gil yosipovitch wake forest university for some people the irritation of an itch can be so intense that they scratch so hard they draw blood .
among those who are most badly affected are people with eczema and those on kidney dialysis .
the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- technology to monitor the brains of 13 volunteers while they were scratched on the lower leg with a small brush .
the scratching went on for 30 seconds and was then stopped for 30 seconds - for a total of about five minutes .
the results showed reduced activity in an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex , which is linked to unpleasant sensory experiences , and in the posterior cingulate cortex , which is associated with memory .
when the volunteers reported the scratching was most intense , activity in these areas was at its lowest .
lead researcher dr gil yosipovitch said : " this is the first real scientific evidence showing that itch may be inhibited by scratching .
" we know scratching is pleasurable , but we have n't known why .
" it is possible that scratching may suppress the emotional components of itch and bring about its relief .
" of course , scratching is not recommended because it can damage the skin .
" but understanding how the process works could lead to new treatments .
for example , drugs that deactivate this part of the brain might be effective . "
compulsion the study also found some areas of the brain were made more active by the scratching .
these included the secondary somatosensory cortex , a sensory area involved in pain , and the prefrontal cortex , which is associated with compulsive behaviour .
one drawback to the study is that the scratching occurred in the absence of itch .
the researchers now plan to examine whether the same pattern of brain activity is produced when a chronic itch is scratched .
dr irene tracey , an expert in pain at the university of oxford , said effective new treatments for itching would be a significant advance , as the problem could be a debilitating for some people .
" i know of people who have been given morphine for pain relief , and have developed a facial itch that was so severe they have opted to come off the morphine and put up with the pain , " she said .
dr tracey said identifying the areas of the brain affected by itching and scratching could potentially lead to new treatments .
however , she said cognitive behaviour therapy designed to impact on the relevant areas was likely to be the most productive approach .

a team from wake forest university in north carolina used imaging technology to follow the changes that take place in the brain when we scratch .
activity was reduced in areas associated with unpleasant emotions , and memories , but increased in an area associated with compulsive behaviour .
the journal of investigative dermatology study raises hopes of new treatments for itching disorders .
understanding how the process works could lead to new treatments dr gil yosipovitch wake forest university for some people the irritation of an itch can be so intense that they scratch so hard they draw blood .
among those who are most badly affected are people with eczema and those on kidney dialysis .
the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- technology to monitor the brains of 13 volunteers while they were scratched on the lower leg with a small brush .
the scratching went on for 30 seconds and was then stopped for 30 seconds - for a total of about five minutes .
the results showed reduced activity in an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex , which is linked to unpleasant sensory experiences , and in the posterior cingulate cortex , which is associated with memory .
when the volunteers reported the scratching was most intense , activity in these areas was at its lowest .
lead researcher dr gil yosipovitch said : " this is the first real scientific evidence showing that itch may be inhibited by scratching .
" we know scratching is pleasurable , but we have n't known why .
" it is possible that scratching may suppress the emotional components of itch and bring about its relief .
" of course , scratching is not recommended because it can damage the skin .
" but understanding how the process works could lead to new treatments .
for example , drugs that deactivate this part of the brain might be effective . "
compulsion the study also found some areas of the brain were made more active by the scratching .
these included the secondary somatosensory cortex , a sensory area involved in pain , and the prefrontal cortex , which is associated with compulsive behaviour .
one drawback to the study is that the scratching occurred in the absence of itch .
the researchers now plan to examine whether the same pattern of brain activity is produced when a chronic itch is scratched .
dr irene tracey , an expert in pain at the university of oxford , said effective new treatments for itching would be a significant advance , as the problem could be a debilitating for some people .
" i know of people who have been given morphine for pain relief , and have developed a facial itch that was so severe they have opted to come off the morphine and put up with the pain , " she said .
dr tracey said identifying the areas of the brain affected by itching and scratching could potentially lead to new treatments .
however , she said cognitive behaviour therapy designed to impact on the relevant areas was likely to be the most productive approach .

metal pegs that are left behind can harm the cows that live on worthy farm , somerset , where the festival is held .
organiser michael eavis will instead ask fans to use a " very stout " biodegradable peg made of potato starch that is used in the turf industry .
the registration period for this year 's event has now opened .
anyone wanting to attend must register by 15 march .
they must submit their details and a photo , which will be printed on their ticket in an attempt to beat touts .
registration does not guarantee a ticket , but everyone who wants to buy a ticket when they go on sale on 6 april must have registered first .
some 175,000 people will attend the festival from 27-29 june .

metal pegs that are left behind can harm the cows that live on worthy farm , somerset , where the festival is held .
organiser michael eavis will instead ask fans to use a " very stout " biodegradable peg made of potato starch that is used in the turf industry .
the registration period for this year 's event has now opened .
anyone wanting to attend must register by 15 march .
they must submit their details and a photo , which will be printed on their ticket in an attempt to beat touts .
michael eavis hosts the festival on his dairy farm in somerset registration does not guarantee a ticket , but everyone who wants to buy a ticket when they go on sale on 6 april must have registered first .
some 175,000 people will attend the festival from 27-29 june .
mr eavis has a skip on his dairy farm full of tent pegs that have been recovered since last year 's event .
they are " a real problem for the cows " , he told bbc news .
" we 're going to buy a biodegradable tent peg this year , but it is very stout actually .
they use it in the turf industry and we 've just discovered it .
" so we 're going to force people to use the tent pegs and not use the wire ones .
potato starch , they 're actually made from . "
thousands of metal tent pegs have been collected from worthy farm different prototypes have been tested , with organisers looking for something that is very strong during the festival but breaks down in the ground over subsequent months .
the move is one of a range of measures to be announced in march aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the festival under the slogan " leave no trace " .
last year , revellers were told any tents that were left behind would be sent to crisis areas around the world .
but owing to a mix-up over who was supposed to collect them , many were binned .
this year 's line-up has not been fully announced , but mr eavis has said us rapper jay-z is to headline the festival , while crooner neil diamond will play the veteran 's slot on the sunday .
