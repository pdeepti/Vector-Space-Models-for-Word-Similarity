europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .

sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .
“ the nurses knew they were killing sick people , and the ss doctor did n't ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .
“ the nurses knew they were killing sick people , and the ss doctor did n't ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .

germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .

iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .

iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .

" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both have denied involvement . former ceo kai-uwe ricke and former chairman klaus zumwinkel , who stepped down in february due to a tax evasion scandal , were more deeply embroiled in the spy affair than originally suspected , former hr manager heinz klinkhammer told the german business daily handelsblatt on wednesday , may 28 . deutsche telekom has admitted that the phone calls of senior executives were monitored in 2005 and 2006 in order to find an internal leak to the press . ricke told handelsblatt that the accusations of his involvement were " false and unfounded " and a spokesman for zumwinkel said he " did not give any personal orders or instructions " concerning the surveillance process . however , according to the business daily , ralf kuehn , who heads the external company hired to examine the phone records , said that " the contract came from the highest level and was approved by the telekom management . " klinkhammer , who was telekom 's personnel manager from 1996 to 2006 , was also quoted as saying that a fellow employee who 'd handled the contract told him that " ricke and zumwinkel asked him to keep quiet about the matter . " public prosecutors in bonn , where deutsche telekom is based , are set to decide this week whether the documents submitted by telekom itself warrant an investigation . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .

but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .

" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market .

nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.05.2008 criticism of iran flares over alleged nuclear secrets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has backed iran 's program the united nations nuclear watchdog has accused iran of conducting secret studies to develop nuclear weapons capabilities .
the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "

a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .

iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .

the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .

we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "

the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .
“ the nurses knew they were killing sick people , and the ss doctor did n't ?

but belarus fought back , exposing german defensive problems in a second-half double by vitali bulyga . two of germany 's group opponents at the june 7-29 euro cup , poland and co-hosts austria , were also in action on the night , with austria held 1-1 by nigeria and poland edging albania 1-0 . the czech republic defeated lithuania 2-0 in another game . german coach promises improvement " all players will be in better form in 12 days time .
that 's a promise , " said german coach joachim loew after the draw with belarus . " the players were tired after hard training .
but it was disappointing that we lost a 2-0 lead . " christoph metzelder and torsten frings returned from long injury layoffs , teenager marko marin won his maiden cap in the second half and captain michael ballack played just one half for the three-time champion germany . the hosts got off to a strong start and took the lead when lukas podolski threaded a pass to his bayern munich teammate klose , who rounded goalkeeper vasili khomutovsky and slotted into the empty net . germany were then 2-0 up as koryko clumsily deflected a cross from real betis winger david odonkor into his own net in the 20th . belarus scored in the 61st when bulyga took up a defense-splitting pass and beat lehmann for the first time in 681 minutes .
lehmann did not look good when the vladivostok striker also grabbed the equalizer from long range with three minutes left . french win , czech faux pas france coach raymond demenech rested some stars including thierry henry and franck ribery against ecuador and the team was jeered after a goalless first half . the hosts improved after the break and gomis reconciled the fans with a superb effort from the edge of the area in the 59th and wrapped up matters in the 86th . austria , who have won just once since the autumn of 2006 , led from roman kienast 's 12th-minute shot from the edge of the area .
but nigeria levelled just seven minutes later from kalu uche in graz . poland defeated albania in reutlingen , germany , from a third-minute winner by captain maciej zurawski as its dutch coach leo beenhakker fielded many likely euro starters the day after experimenting in a 1-1 draw against macedonia . poland dominated and were unlucky when defender mariusz lewandowski was denied by the post in the 48th . the czechs , due to play the euro opener on june 7 against co-hosts switzerland , beat lithuania with veteran jan koller 's double in 39th and 62nd minutes . the victory was partly spoiled by an embarrassing blunder on the part of the czech football association , which had confused lithuania with another baltic state , neighboring latvia .
a latvian flag and the photo of the latvian team were depicted in the official brochure and the latvian anthem was played ahead of the match . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .

“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .
but whether that will help germany avoid another disaster at the 2009 eurovision song contest in moscow is another matter entirely . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .
but whether that will help germany avoid another disaster at the 2009 eurovision song contest in moscow is another matter entirely . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .

without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 28.05.2008 eu nations commit to increase aid to beat food crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clamor for food in some areas of the world continues to increase european union countries reiterated their promise to increase the amount of aid they give to developing nations , as spiraling food prices threaten their pledge to halve world hunger by 2015 . however , many member states were reprimanded by the eu executive , the commission , for failing to outline detailed plans on how they intend to meet their commitments .
at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but belarus fought back , exposing german defensive problems in a second-half double by vitali bulyga . two of germany 's group opponents at the june 7-29 euro cup , poland and co-hosts austria , were also in action on the night , with austria held 1-1 by nigeria and poland edging albania 1-0 . the czech republic defeated lithuania 2-0 in another game . german coach promises improvement " all players will be in better form in 12 days time .
that 's a promise , " said german coach joachim loew after the draw with belarus . " the players were tired after hard training .
but it was disappointing that we lost a 2-0 lead . " christoph metzelder and torsten frings returned from long injury layoffs , teenager marko marin won his maiden cap in the second half and captain michael ballack played just one half for the three-time champion germany . the hosts got off to a strong start and took the lead when lukas podolski threaded a pass to his bayern munich teammate klose , who rounded goalkeeper vasili khomutovsky and slotted into the empty net . germany were then 2-0 up as koryko clumsily deflected a cross from real betis winger david odonkor into his own net in the 20th . belarus scored in the 61st when bulyga took up a defense-splitting pass and beat lehmann for the first time in 681 minutes .
lehmann did not look good when the vladivostok striker also grabbed the equalizer from long range with three minutes left . french win , czech faux pas france coach raymond demenech rested some stars including thierry henry and franck ribery against ecuador and the team was jeered after a goalless first half . the hosts improved after the break and gomis reconciled the fans with a superb effort from the edge of the area in the 59th and wrapped up matters in the 86th . austria , who have won just once since the autumn of 2006 , led from roman kienast 's 12th-minute shot from the edge of the area .

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "

iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .

iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .

" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "

the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.05.2008 eu parliament votes to protect baltic from russian gas pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic gas pipeline could be blocked if the environment comes under danger the eu should block the nord stream gas pipeline if it proves to be an environmental threat , and stop russian energy giant gazprom from unfairly dominating eu markets , the european parliament voted tuesday , may 27 . the parliament 's petitions committee also criticized the way in which the pipeline was planned by germany and russia without eu involvement , saying that this had damaged the scheme 's credibility and political support .
and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de warsaw to present alternative pipeline plan to moscow the journey of the controversial gas pipeline that germany and russia are planning to build along the baltic seabed took another twist when poland said it would take its own proposal on the pipeline 's route to moscow .
-lrb- 30.01.2008 -rrb- mounting concerns put baltic sea gas pipeline at risk poland 's incoming prime minister , donald tusk , has said that worries about natural gas supplies and the environment might mean an end to the planned pipeline that would ship russian supplies directly to germany .
-lrb- 07.11.2007 -rrb- new twists and turns in german-russian gas pipeline saga the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .

sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forgeard made a profit of some 2.5 million euros -lrb- currently about $ 3.95 million -rrb- on the sale .
in addition , his children sold 128,000 eads shares several days after he did , and made more than 4.2 million euros .
forgeard was taken into custody after being questioned wednesday by investigators trying to ascertain if he carried out the transactions on the basis of privileged information .
forgeard says he 's innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard has denied the charges against him in november 2006 , the french markets watchdog amf opened an inquiry into the sales of the shares by forgeard and 16 other eads and airbus executives who exercised stock options on some 1.7 million eads shares before june 13 , 2006 , for a gross profit of about 20 million euros .
earlier this year , forgeard said he and the other executives were innocent , noting that " suspicions are not proofs . "
however , he admitted that he should not have sold the shares when he did .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to forgeard being forced to step down .
he left the company with a " golden parachute " worth 8.55 million euros , which caused a furore in france .
forgeard was head of airbus from april 1998 until june 2005 , and eads co-ceo from june 2005 until july 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .

" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .
but whether that will help germany avoid another disaster at the 2009 eurovision song contest in moscow is another matter entirely . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but belarus fought back , exposing german defensive problems in a second-half double by vitali bulyga . two of germany 's group opponents at the june 7-29 euro cup , poland and co-hosts austria , were also in action on the night , with austria held 1-1 by nigeria and poland edging albania 1-0 . the czech republic defeated lithuania 2-0 in another game . german coach promises improvement " all players will be in better form in 12 days time .
that 's a promise , " said german coach joachim loew after the draw with belarus . " the players were tired after hard training .
but it was disappointing that we lost a 2-0 lead . " christoph metzelder and torsten frings returned from long injury layoffs , teenager marko marin won his maiden cap in the second half and captain michael ballack played just one half for the three-time champion germany . the hosts got off to a strong start and took the lead when lukas podolski threaded a pass to his bayern munich teammate klose , who rounded goalkeeper vasili khomutovsky and slotted into the empty net . germany were then 2-0 up as koryko clumsily deflected a cross from real betis winger david odonkor into his own net in the 20th . belarus scored in the 61st when bulyga took up a defense-splitting pass and beat lehmann for the first time in 681 minutes .
lehmann did not look good when the vladivostok striker also grabbed the equalizer from long range with three minutes left . french win , czech faux pas france coach raymond demenech rested some stars including thierry henry and franck ribery against ecuador and the team was jeered after a goalless first half . the hosts improved after the break and gomis reconciled the fans with a superb effort from the edge of the area in the 59th and wrapped up matters in the 86th . austria , who have won just once since the autumn of 2006 , led from roman kienast 's 12th-minute shot from the edge of the area .
but nigeria levelled just seven minutes later from kalu uche in graz . poland defeated albania in reutlingen , germany , from a third-minute winner by captain maciej zurawski as its dutch coach leo beenhakker fielded many likely euro starters the day after experimenting in a 1-1 draw against macedonia . poland dominated and were unlucky when defender mariusz lewandowski was denied by the post in the 48th . the czechs , due to play the euro opener on june 7 against co-hosts switzerland , beat lithuania with veteran jan koller 's double in 39th and 62nd minutes . the victory was partly spoiled by an embarrassing blunder on the part of the czech football association , which had confused lithuania with another baltic state , neighboring latvia .

both have denied involvement . former ceo kai-uwe ricke and former chairman klaus zumwinkel , who stepped down in february due to a tax evasion scandal , were more deeply embroiled in the spy affair than originally suspected , former hr manager heinz klinkhammer told the german business daily handelsblatt on wednesday , may 28 . deutsche telekom has admitted that the phone calls of senior executives were monitored in 2005 and 2006 in order to find an internal leak to the press . ricke told handelsblatt that the accusations of his involvement were " false and unfounded " and a spokesman for zumwinkel said he " did not give any personal orders or instructions " concerning the surveillance process . however , according to the business daily , ralf kuehn , who heads the external company hired to examine the phone records , said that " the contract came from the highest level and was approved by the telekom management . " klinkhammer , who was telekom 's personnel manager from 1996 to 2006 , was also quoted as saying that a fellow employee who 'd handled the contract told him that " ricke and zumwinkel asked him to keep quiet about the matter . " public prosecutors in bonn , where deutsche telekom is based , are set to decide this week whether the documents submitted by telekom itself warrant an investigation . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .

“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .

the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .
“ the nurses knew they were killing sick people , and the ss doctor did n't ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?

bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .

but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .
" not that bad a song really , but the singing was crap , " wrote one on youtube .
" as if they had never been on stage before , " seconded another .
" we should tank bulgaria for making this disaster seem a bit more respectable , " opined a third .
four-point plan for better kitsch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's kalomira showed more skin and came in third outsiders might be baffled at why a musical culture that gave the world beethoven and richard strauss would get so worked up about an event whose popularity is based partly on the fact that most of the acts are so tasteless .
but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .
but whether that will help germany avoid another disaster at the 2009 eurovision song contest in moscow is another matter entirely . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "

" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .

bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .

until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "

the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "

germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .

but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.05.2008 eu parliament votes to protect baltic from russian gas pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic gas pipeline could be blocked if the environment comes under danger the eu should block the nord stream gas pipeline if it proves to be an environmental threat , and stop russian energy giant gazprom from unfairly dominating eu markets , the european parliament voted tuesday , may 27 . the parliament 's petitions committee also criticized the way in which the pipeline was planned by germany and russia without eu involvement , saying that this had damaged the scheme 's credibility and political support .
and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de warsaw to present alternative pipeline plan to moscow the journey of the controversial gas pipeline that germany and russia are planning to build along the baltic seabed took another twist when poland said it would take its own proposal on the pipeline 's route to moscow .
-lrb- 30.01.2008 -rrb- mounting concerns put baltic sea gas pipeline at risk poland 's incoming prime minister , donald tusk , has said that worries about natural gas supplies and the environment might mean an end to the planned pipeline that would ship russian supplies directly to germany .

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.05.2008 criticism of iran flares over alleged nuclear secrets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has backed iran 's program the united nations nuclear watchdog has accused iran of conducting secret studies to develop nuclear weapons capabilities .
the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.05.2008 criticism of iran flares over alleged nuclear secrets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has backed iran 's program the united nations nuclear watchdog has accused iran of conducting secret studies to develop nuclear weapons capabilities .
the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .
“ the nurses knew they were killing sick people , and the ss doctor did n't ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.05.2008 criticism of iran flares over alleged nuclear secrets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has backed iran 's program the united nations nuclear watchdog has accused iran of conducting secret studies to develop nuclear weapons capabilities .
the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .

until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference biodiversity loss can dent world economy , study warns environment -pipe- 28.05.2008 merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged 500 million euros for biodiversity preservation setting a highlight at an otherwise floundering un biodiversity conference , german chancellor angela merkel agreed to boost funding for a species protection and nature conservancy program . environmental groups had appealed to merkel to rescue the two-week un convention on biological diversity , or cbd , from failure ahead of its final phase , which began wednesday , may 28 . some 6,000 delegates from almost 200 countries have gathered in bonn for the two-week convention .
now , in its final days , environment ministers from nearly 100 nations have arrived to wrap up the proceedings meant to preserve biological diversity on the planet . whether the conference fails or not is down to merkel and the other ministers , " greenpeace spokesman martin kaiser said . big financial committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biological diversity at sea has reached a critical point on midday wednesday , merkel committed to spend 500 million euros -lrb- $ 788 million -rrb- over the next four years to protect forests and other habitats , with the aim of securing greater biological diversity . germany will make the funds available between 2009 and 2012 , and after that , it will free up 500 million euros per year for forest protection . the nature conservancy and germany 's nature protection federation applauded the announcement , saying it is “ urgently needed new funding for global forest preservation and national parks and protected areas . ” the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , has been largely deadlocked .
like the un climate-change convention , the biodiversity pact requires a consensus decision among the 191 parties .
the cbd , which commits parties to halting species loss by 2010 , has been ratified by around 190 countries , but crucially not by the united states . " the talks have become bogged down in all the important points , ” said joerg roos , a spokesman for the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
“ every comma is being debated , as though it were a matter of life and death . " he had hoped that a strong speech from merkel would break the logjam . " the environment ministers wo n't do it on their own , " kaiser added .
" merkel must speak to the various heads of state and government . " further funding for conservation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon indians asked for more support to prevent deforestation according to the conservation bodies , the international community is currently investing up to 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- in conservation areas , compared with the 20-30 billion euros needed . further funding was a necessity , according to kaiser .
without it , poorer countries would not be convinced to enter into agreements on conservation measures . the iucn international conservation union likewise called on the conference to do more . " governments must finally decide on certain conservation areas and then work together for their protection , " said julia marton-lefevre , the general director of the iucn . an increasing number of oceanic species were threatened by extinction , and many oceanic biospheres were endangered , she continued .
biological diversity at sea was at a critical point and the patchwork legal framework of international maritime law had for long merely been an obstacle to conservation . she saw the conference , the last of the cbd parties before 2010 , as the last real opportunity to cut the loss of diversity by 2010 and to create networks of oceanic protection areas by the goal of 2012 . greater rights for amazon indians also at the conference , representatives of amazon indians called for greater rights in the use of tropical rain forests . around a fifth of the brazilian amazon has been designated indian territory and is being administered by the indigenous tribes . they should be compensated for their contribution to maintaining biological diversity there and to the stabilization of the global climate , their representatives said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers . " after the meeting barroso opened a two-day meeting organized by pik and the group action for a global climate community on ways for india to achieve sustainable economic development that brings prosperity without damaging the climate . careful driving spares co2 , gas costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to save gas , watch the traffic and drive in the highest appropriate gear also on tuesday , the european commission launched a low-petrol driving campaign aimed at further reducing emissions . a clip on the eu 's youtube site , eutube , says , " how can we reduce our consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions without having to invest in new technology ? a few good habits will help save money , prolong the life of your engine and actively contribute to protecting our planet . " according to the campaign , which is backed by the european commission and the european petroleum industry association , europia , habits such as keeping your car 's tires at the correct pressure and using air conditioning less can cut fuel consumption by 10 percent . simple driving techniques such as anticipating the flow of traffic ahead and keeping engine revolutions down can add further savings , the clip says . " the name of the game when it comes to consuming less is to reach your cruising speed fairly quickly and then to use the highest gear possible , " the clip advises . in one practice run , a driver who used the techniques on a 10-kilometer drive cut his consumption from 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 32 miles per gallon -rrb- to 4.96 liters per 100 kilometers -lrb- 47.4 miles per gallon -rrb- . translated into a year 's worth of driving 25,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,500 miles -rrb- , that would equate to a saving of 875 euros -lrb- $ 1,380 -rrb- , the clip says . resistance from auto industry the eu is committed to significantly reducing its co2 emissions by 2020 and reducing emissions from the transport industry is seen as key to achieving that goal . however , plans to force car manufacturers to make their products more environmentally friendly have run into strong opposition , leaving eu officials keen to find other ways of making cuts . dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu also launched a bloc-wide campaign to promote low-co2 driving techniques . india could benefit for decades on end from a fair co2 trading scheme , since it could earn income by selling the valuable rights , said hans joachim schellnhuber , a leading german scientist who works from potsdam , on tuesday , may 27 . " if nations like india or china simply copy the development pattern of europe , the world will end up with an utterly different climate , " schellnhuber warned after the potsdam talks , attended by european commission president jose manuel barroso . indian energy and climate experts traveled to potsdam near berlin to hear more about the eu proposals .
barroso and scientists had held a similar meeting in april in beijing with chinese scientists . monetary rewards for low emitters in carbon trading , rights to pollute are fairly distributed round the world .
by freely buying and selling the rights internationally , those who cut emissions obtain a reward by selling their rights , whereas polluters feel the pain financially . schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for climate-impact research pik , admitted that factories in india or china which refused to use modern low-carbon technology would lose out : " companies that refuse to read the signs of the times will end up the losers .

" public prosecutors in bonn , where deutsche telekom is based , are set to decide this week whether the documents submitted by telekom itself warrant an investigation . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 28.05.2008 german milk strike spreads to other european nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers voiced protests at a press conference with a cardboard cow in german colors with food costs rising around the world , a strike by german dairy farmers over falling milk prices spread to other european nations .
organizers say consumers will soon feel the pinch . a continuing delivery strike by some 30,000 german dairy farmers in protest at eu moves to raise production quotas and push down prices has spread from southern germany to the north , and also affected milk deliveries in the zurich area of switzerland , and holland .
deliveries dropped by some 60 percent in the netherlands and in switzerland 's zurich region as farmers showed solidarity with german dairymen , the european milk board , based in hamm , germany , said on wednesday , may 28 .
across germany , more than 50 percent of usual milk deliveries were not made , german federal dairy farmers association -lrb- bdm -rrb- said on wednesday in berlin .
end-consumers should soon begin to see the effects of the boycott , a bdm executive said .
calls for higher milk prices the strike began on tuesday as farmers heeded a call by the bdm to stop supplying milk , in a bid to force up prices hovering between 0.28 and 0.34 euro -lrb- $ 0.43 and $ .53 -rrb- per liter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german dairy farmer protests against low prices by sloshing milk into a trough to feed his animals " we plan to decrease the flow to the food industry further still in coming days and then supermarkets will start feeling the pinch , " said hans foldenauer , a spokesman for the bdm .
bdm deputy president stefan mann said federation had received " several declarations of support " from austria , belgium , luxembourg , switzerland , the netherlands and " parts of france . "
" i expect more countries to join the strike , " he told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
germany is europe 's biggest milk producer .
the bdm is demanding the milk price be pushed up to 43 cents per liter , saying that it is uneconomic to sell below 40 cents per liter .
bdm members produce some 45 percent of germany 's milk .
austria joins boycott austria 's ig milch dairy association on wednesday called on its 6,000 members to cut back deliveries by half in protest at the milk price .
ig milch head ewald gruenzweil warned consumers , especially hospitals , kindergarten and schools , to start stocking dairy products .
" we 're predicting -lrb- supermarket -rrb- shelves to empty rather quickly as people start hoarding , following this determined action in germany and other european countries , " he said .
the aim of the austrian move was to prevent milk being exported to germany , austrian daily der standard reported .
about 45 percent of austrian milk producers currently export their products .
the excess milk will now be used as feed , be processed or added to manure dumps .
the dutch dairymen board -lrb- ddb -rrb- has urged its 4,000 producers to " keep the milk on the farm . "
switzerland 's big-m union said 200 producers in the zurich region had delivered virtually no milk on wednesday .
food industry remains unruffled despite these warnings , food-industry representatives deny consumers will see any effects .
“ there will be no limitations on consumers , just because farmers are refusing to deliver milk , ” said the head of the association of german food industries , juergen abraham , in berlin . “ the danes and the dutch are ready to fill the void .
they 'll be happy to do it , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german food industry says consumers will be unaffected by the strike the milk producers are demanding new , yearly tariff negotiations with the dairy factories that will set base milk prices .
until such a system is in place , no milk will be delivered , bdm chief romuald schaber said .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , took the side of the farmers , saying an efficient farming sector is important for the country .
he reiterated his criticism of the eu decision to once more raise milk production quotas .
" dairy farmers need a price they can live on , " seehofer said .
" the objective has my political support . "
but he rejected the suggestion by opposition party free democrats to give concrete tax breaks to the dairy farmers .
“ that immediately sets off other industries to saying , ‘ we have problems too , and who is helping us ? ' ”
dairy group to file lawsuit germany opposed a decision by european union agriculture ministers in march this year to allow a bloc-wide increase in production of two percent as part of a larger plan to phase out dairy subsidies by 2015 .
seehofer at the time warned there was a risk the move could lead to " new milk lakes and butter mountains , " a reference to surplus production in europe triggered in 1984 .
the bdm said it will file a lawsuit at the european court of justice to stop to the quota hike .
brussels has said it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un agency sharpened its critical tone ahead of a key meeting next week . criticism of iran sharpened tuesday , may 27 after the united nation 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- released a report that accused iran of withholding information .
germany said the report showed that the international community must push for a faster response from tehran .
the iaea report makes it clear that iran " is still not demonstrating the spirit of cooperation , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained .
" the ball is in the iranians ' court , " steinmeier said .
" either it is picked up there , and we 're getting reasonable answers to our questions , or the entry into talks with the aim of a diplomatic solution to the conflict is further delayed .
the alternative would then be an increase of international pressure , also through the un security council . "
secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

secret studies of " serious concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea says iran is n't cooperating the alleged secret studies suggest iran may have been trying to develop a nuclear warhead , convert uranium and test high explosives and a missile re-entry vehicle , according to the iaea report , which was released late monday .
iran has repeatedly dismissed the existence of secret studies , calling the accusation " baseless " and the intelligence which western governments site as showing the studies exist as " forged . "
but the iaea has demanded " substantive " evidence that it 's nuclear aspirations are peaceful .
" the alleged studies ... remain a matter of serious concern .
clarification of these is critical to an assessment of the nature of iran 's past and present nuclear program , " the iaea said in a statement .
the report said intelligence from a number of sources shows iran has conducted the studies .
it will be discussed by the iaea 's board of governors next week .
iran refuses to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists it does not plan to make nuclear weapons iran has recently sped up its uranium enrichment , a process which can be used to make fissile material for an atomic bomb .
iran claims it wants enriched uranium to use for energy , not bombs .
iran has refused to change course , despite three rounds of un sanctions .
" substantive explanations are required from iran to support its statements on the alleged studies and on other information with a possible military dimension , " the report insisted .
the iaea said it was continuing to " assess the information and explanations provided by iran " but found them to be inadequate .
the iaea believes iran may have additional information , particularly in the areas of high explosives testing and missiles , which it needs to share with the agency .
enrichment is " peaceful " for iran , there 's little that has been left unsaid .
" we have left no question unanswered .
we have given all the explanations needed as far as we are concerned , " iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh told the french news agency " afp " in a telephone interview .
" we have given 200 pages of explanations " with regard to the so-called weaponization allegations , soltanieh continued .
" we have dealt with this in depth . "
the iranian envoy insisted the new report was " a vindication and reiteration of the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear activities . "
iran will not back down on the matter and will not suspend enrichment , soltanieh said .
" we will continue enrichment , while not suspending our cooperation with the iaea . "
in all , iran was operating about 3,500 uranium-enriching centrifuges at its main nuclear site in natanz , the report said .
tehran has told the iaea it hopes to nearly double that amount within the next few months .
the agency believes the target is achievable , a senior official close to the vienna-based watchdog told " afp . "
iran accused of stonewalling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further high-stakes meetings on iran 's nuclear program will take place next week us and european officials said the iaea report proves that iran is continuing to stonewall the agency 's long-running investigation into its atomic buildup .
" the report shows in great detail how much iran needs to explain , and how little it has , " said the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte .
the international atomic energy agency is " clearly frustrated by iran 's stonewalling .
they want answers , " said joe cirincione , non-proliferation expert and head of the washington-based ploughshares fund told " afp . "
mark fitzpatrick , non-proliferation expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london , noted the unusually strong tone of the report .
it was " harder on iran , both in the detail and in the tone , " fitzpatrick told " afp . "
europe still hopeful of deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants more pressure put on iran germany belongs to the six-nation group negotiating with iran , which also includes the permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday that berlin and the five nations remained committed to negotiating a way of getting iran to comply with security council demands to stop uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities .
spokesman martin jaeger said he hoped an " improved and expanded " offer of incentives to iran worked out by the six-nation group could be made " very soon . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forgeard made a profit of some 2.5 million euros -lrb- currently about $ 3.95 million -rrb- on the sale .
in addition , his children sold 128,000 eads shares several days after he did , and made more than 4.2 million euros .
forgeard was taken into custody after being questioned wednesday by investigators trying to ascertain if he carried out the transactions on the basis of privileged information .
forgeard says he 's innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard has denied the charges against him in november 2006 , the french markets watchdog amf opened an inquiry into the sales of the shares by forgeard and 16 other eads and airbus executives who exercised stock options on some 1.7 million eads shares before june 13 , 2006 , for a gross profit of about 20 million euros .
earlier this year , forgeard said he and the other executives were innocent , noting that " suspicions are not proofs . "
however , he admitted that he should not have sold the shares when he did .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to forgeard being forced to step down .
he left the company with a " golden parachute " worth 8.55 million euros , which caused a furore in france .
forgeard was head of airbus from april 1998 until june 2005 , and eads co-ceo from june 2005 until july 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forgeard made a profit of some 2.5 million euros -lrb- currently about $ 3.95 million -rrb- on the sale .
in addition , his children sold 128,000 eads shares several days after he did , and made more than 4.2 million euros .
forgeard was taken into custody after being questioned wednesday by investigators trying to ascertain if he carried out the transactions on the basis of privileged information .
forgeard says he 's innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard has denied the charges against him in november 2006 , the french markets watchdog amf opened an inquiry into the sales of the shares by forgeard and 16 other eads and airbus executives who exercised stock options on some 1.7 million eads shares before june 13 , 2006 , for a gross profit of about 20 million euros .
earlier this year , forgeard said he and the other executives were innocent , noting that " suspicions are not proofs . "
however , he admitted that he should not have sold the shares when he did .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to forgeard being forced to step down .
he left the company with a " golden parachute " worth 8.55 million euros , which caused a furore in france .
forgeard was head of airbus from april 1998 until june 2005 , and eads co-ceo from june 2005 until july 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it called for the eu to create a high-level post in the office of the bloc 's foreign affairs chief to oversee such projects in the future , in an implicit challenge to the eu 's stance that energy projects should be weighed on their technical merits alone .
the nord stream project was launched by germany and russia in late 2005 and is aimed at bringing russian gas to the german market under the baltic sea , thus bypassing transit states such as ukraine .
but it quickly ran into opposition from new eu members such as poland , who complained that they had not been consulted and warned that the pipeline could disturb some of the 80,000 tons of chemical weapons dumped in the baltic after world war ii .
tuesday 's motion , which followed petitions from polish and lithuanian environmental groups , called on the eu to use " every means at its disposal " to block the project if independent studies prove there is a risk of environmental disaster in the baltic .
the report also demanded that nord stream 's backers - gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall - study the feasibility of running the pipeline overland before they take the undersea route .
eu aiming to prevent gazprom influence over markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's growing influence is worrying the eu and it called on the european commission to stop gazprom " assuming a dominant role on the eu gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for eu companies to enter the russian energy market . "
nord stream was quick to respond to the vote , saying that the text approved by the committee was " misleading " and prejudiced .
" the pipeline has been planned with a profound awareness of the environmental issues and conditions of the baltic sea , " the company said in a statement .
the motion , approved by 26 meps with three votes against , is now set to face a vote in parliament in july .
however , even if the motion is approved there , its importance will remain largely symbolic , as the parliament has no authority to approve or ban such projects . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting a goose-egg from 40 of 42 countries , germans are asked why they ca n't do better at europe 's kitschy song contest . germany 's third-from-last place finish with 14 points was n't the worst-ever eurovision showing .
but disappointment was still huge since no angels - a girl group that emerged from a casting contest - had landed a series of radio hits on continental europe .
but in the post-debacle fall-out , critics disagree as to why no angels failed so miserably to attract votes .
" are we too stupid to win or is it simply that we 're not liked ? " asked the sunday edition of the bild newspaper one day after the contest in belgrade , serbia .
because eurovision viewers are barred from voting for contestants from their own countries , title aspirants depend on the good will of foreigners - especially from neighboring nations .
there has been repeated criticism in recent years that eastern european countries trade votes .
" russia only won thanks to considerable help form its neighbors , " the daily newspaper die welt carped .
" the russian song was n't bad , but it was n't any better than the rest . "
this year 's winning song was " believe " by dima bilan .
sound or singing problems ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds in hamburg followed the missed notes and botched dance routines others sought musical explanations for the cold shoulder given to the angels .
" in the belgrade arena , their performance sounded great , " said ralf quibeldey , head of entertainment at northern german radio , which organizes germany 's eurovision entry .
" but what 's decisive is tv , and there the sound quality was n't as convincing as live , " quibeldey told dpa news agency .
no angels singer lucy diakowska agreed .
" we delivered a great performance , but the viewers did n't recognize it , " the bulgarian-born singer told reuters .
bulgaria gave germany the maximum 12 points .
but in fact , the four singers were rarely on the same page harmonically during their three minute appearance - a fact not lost on many german bloggers .

but the german pop music establishment is indeed incensed .
music producer and tv casting show host dieter bohlen has even come up with a four-point plan to improve germany 's results .
" we have to enter one individual performer , " bohlen told bild .
" that way there 's less chance of mistakes . "
bohlen also said that the national preliminary should feature more than five songs , that national winners should be catchier and that as a large country germany should lobby for more votes .
as a former member of the german soft-pop duo modern talking , who scored a handful of number-one hits in germany in the 1980s , bohlen knows a thing or two about melting sentimental hearts with musical treacle .

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .

sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 28.05.2008 eu nations commit to increase aid to beat food crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clamor for food in some areas of the world continues to increase european union countries reiterated their promise to increase the amount of aid they give to developing nations , as spiraling food prices threaten their pledge to halve world hunger by 2015 . however , many member states were reprimanded by the eu executive , the commission , for failing to outline detailed plans on how they intend to meet their commitments .
at a meeting in brussels , eu development ministers reaffirmed their intention of increasing aid to 0.56 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and to 0.7 percent in 2015 .
according to some estimates , the 2010 target should translate into aid worth 66 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- in 2010 , up from 46.1 billion euros in 2007 .
while the eu remains the biggest donor in the world , the 2007 figure was down from 47.7 billion in 2006 and represented the first drop in aid since 2000 .
of the four biggest eu donors - britain , france , germany and italy - only germany maintained its aid level , while france cut its aid by the biggest amount .
stick to your commitments , says development commissioner louis michel , the eu commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid , called on ministers to stick to their commitments and " show how they will meet them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel urged eu nations to stick to their goals eight years ago , leaders from nearly 190 countries , including all of the eu 's , agreed on a set of ambitious millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , to be achieved by 2015 .
these include halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty , getting every small child in the world to school , significantly reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability .
but since the declaration was signed , average global food prices have surged by 75 percent , according to a world bank report , sparking food riots in several poor countries .
meanwhile , the number of chronically undernourished people , at 850 million , remains stubbornly high .
eu believes goals can be met in their council conclusions , eu development ministers said there was " sufficient progress in some areas for the eu to believe that all mdgs can be achieved in all regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sub-saharan communities are some of those at most risk " however , there are serious concerns about the trends in some regions , especially sub-saharan africa , " they added .
andrej ster , state secretary of slovenia , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said food prices were " endangering our very important development goals . "
" it is time to send out alarm bells , " added jean-louis schiltz , development minister for luxembourg , before noting that 2007 had turned out to be " a bad year for development aid " .
ministers said they would support a series of measures designed to cool off food prices , such as using " policy dialogue with third countries ... to discourage food export restrictions and export bans . "
export bans in operation indonesia , vietnam , egypt and kazakhstan are among a number of asian and african countries to have limited or banned the export of food since prices began to soar .
while the price rise has largely been blamed on higher demand in rapidly developing countries such as china and india , many eu governments are still reluctant to end farm subsidies , which have also been blamed for keeping food prices artificially high . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forgeard made a profit of some 2.5 million euros -lrb- currently about $ 3.95 million -rrb- on the sale .
in addition , his children sold 128,000 eads shares several days after he did , and made more than 4.2 million euros .
forgeard was taken into custody after being questioned wednesday by investigators trying to ascertain if he carried out the transactions on the basis of privileged information .
forgeard says he 's innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard has denied the charges against him in november 2006 , the french markets watchdog amf opened an inquiry into the sales of the shares by forgeard and 16 other eads and airbus executives who exercised stock options on some 1.7 million eads shares before june 13 , 2006 , for a gross profit of about 20 million euros .
earlier this year , forgeard said he and the other executives were innocent , noting that " suspicions are not proofs . "
however , he admitted that he should not have sold the shares when he did .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to forgeard being forced to step down .
he left the company with a " golden parachute " worth 8.55 million euros , which caused a furore in france .
forgeard was head of airbus from april 1998 until june 2005 , and eads co-ceo from june 2005 until july 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .

europe should do more to keep its human rights promise , writes dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . it is alarming that , as amnesty international presented in its annual report , people were tortured or treated inhumanely in 81 countries last year alone . since free speech and freedom of the press were violated in just as many countries , one could conclude that the responsible political leaders are unscrupulously trying to secure their power and are perfectly willing to sacrifice democratic culture along the way . that women are mistreated in countless countries and discriminated against because of their gender does n't vouch for equality , but for the principle of male dominance . all over the world , citizens need truthful , trustworthy , responsibly acting governments that are prepared to allow for competition to find the best solutions according to democratic principles . new challenges to face globalization has presented humanity with new challenges - climate change and natural catastrophes , the loss of biodiversity , increasing poverty , aids and malaria , just to name a few . governments must finally aim to meet these challegnes , while fairly negotiating a variety of interests to guarantee the people a peaceful , humane life - whether in burma or zimbabwe , in pakistan or sudan , in iraq or afghanistan . these countries would certainly be more inclined to take responsibility if leaders like the us would do without the double standards that 's been evident recently .
the us is hardly credible when it tells other countries to observe human rights but incarcerates people without a prosecution or trial , like in guantanamo , or allows the cia to implement torture methods that simulate drowning -lrb- " waterboarding " -rrb- . countries like china and russia also have to seriously address their human rights problems . keeping a promise even europe 's human rights system , which receives praise around the world , needs more tweaking in light of the new challenges .
according to amnesty international , no european country has been taken the necessary measures to avoid taking part in secret renditions by the us in the future . the same is true of governments on all continents : the united nations universal declaration of human rights , which was signed 60 years ago with hope and promise , represents the result of centuries of human rights experiences . this binding legal commitment should be honored by the international community .
this alone makes governments capable of what the world expects from the united nations .
otherwise people will lose their patience with and trust in those who govern . amnesty international 's annual report is proof that an active civil society is called upon to keep this promise . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem has also protested the move .
on saturday , may 24 , sewering was honored with the top award of the german internists group , known as the bdi .
the award was presented for having “ perfomed unequalled services in the cause of freedom of the practice and the independence of the medical profession , and to the nation 's health system , " according to a bdi press statement .
but stephen kramer from the central council of jews said sewering 's nazi past was well known .
in 1993 he was publicly pressured to decline the presidency of the world medical association because of his alleged nazi activities .
the bdi , which has some 25,000 members , defended its decision , saying sewering had been investigated by german prosecutors and was never charged .
magazine : evidence of euthanasia experiments on wednesday , may 28 , the head of the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem , efraim zuroff , asked the group to retract the honor , and to take back the guenther budelmann medal sewering was awarded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal center 's zuroff is a top nazi hunter “ it is bad enough that sewering did not have to stand trial for his involvement in the national socialist mass murders , “ zuroff told dpa news service .
“ it is even worse to honor an ss-man and a liar who has so far avoided justice , despite having taken part in euthanasia experiments . ”
since 1978 , german news magazine der spiegel has published documents testifying that sewering , while a doctor at tuberculosis clinic at schoebrunn near munich , sent a 14-year-old girl to die at a euthanasia center .
sewering denies knowledge of euthanasia sewering has admitted to being a member of the ss , an elite nazi formation , but has always denied being responsible for euthanasia .
for years , the wiesenthal center has been trying to get the bavarian justice system to pay attention to what it says is proof of sewering 's euthanasia activities .
sewering is now 92 years old .
in 1933 he was a member of the ss , and in 1934 he joined the nazi party .
as a doctor in the tuberculosis clinic in schoenbrunn , near dachau , in 1942 he is said to have been involved in the euthanasia program , which targeted handicapped children .
according to the wiesenthal center , sewering directly signed over six to eight patients to the death camp at eglfing-haar .
three of them were killed there .
earlier investigations ended the investigations into sewering 's activities stopped because he claimed ignorance about the killings .
“ this claim is false , ” wiesenthal center 's zuroff told dpa .

president bashar assad himself lived in the uk for many years before coming to power in 2000 after the death of his father .
measures include economic incentives and exemptions from military service .
the latter was one of the main reasons expatriates would not even come back to the country to visit their families .
baha issa , in his 30s , lived for more than 15 years in the uk and dubai .
he has now left his job as a communications officer for microsoft to work at the newly established sham holding company in syria .
" i am very excited to come back .
in a developed country you have slowly to climb the career ladder , but here you are part of a team that is taking the country to a different level , " he says .
it is a message the government - which estimates that 15 million syrians are living abroad , compared with 20 million at home - is keen to promote .
high qualifications dr buthaina shabaan is in charge of a special ministry set up to encourage them to return , bringing their business know-how with them .
" the ministry is established to facilitate relationships between expatriates and syria .
many of these expatriates are highly qualified .
it would be very beneficial to get them back , not necessarily to leave their countries , but at least to build bridges . "
dr shabaan admits syria is not always an easy place to work .
as a country in transition , its institutions still have a long way to go to achieve efficiency .
" do n't think that we can make syria a better place -lsb- immediately -rsb- .
you are coming back to participate in making syria a better place , including fighting bureaucracy , corruption and every negative aspect that we all suffer from . "
some believe that the culture of the homeland , along with new business opportunities , compensates for difficulties .
in the 1990s , samer kallas - an architect in his 50s who lived the us - was reluctant to live in a country that was lagging behind the west technologically and in terms of development . "
i came back because it is my right to come back .
i do n't think much has changed in the nature of authorities " artist yousef abdalki but after 11 september , 2001 , his view changed .
" there is no perfect place on earth .
syria has a lot of obstacles , but we should not expect everything to be available and ready and given .
" after 11 september , the whole atmosphere in the us became distorted , especially towards arab origins or background , so i felt more freedom to come back to the middle east " .
absent freedoms but for many returning syrians , the greater economic freedom does not fully make up for the lack of political freedom .
yousef abdalki , a well-known artist who went to france in the 1980s after being jailed for membership of the socialist labour party , has now returned to settle in his old home town .
" i came back because it is my right to come back .
i do n't think much has changed in the nature of authorities or their security control , but the global situation has changed .
" we still have people imprisoned for expressing their views .
i do n't think a country can develop while freedoms are absent . "
nevertheless , he says he has great hope that syrians will one day enjoy freedom of expression .
in the old city of damascus , young musicians prepare for a concert at a small theatre .
theatro is a popular venue that was opened by actress mai skaf .
she is keen to offer young syrian artists a place for free expression .
" theatro started with an idea which was a dream that we as young artists have energy , enthusiasm , and a desire to work in a field that we know and that is an entity for us .
" cultural movements raise the infrastructure of the society and create chances for young artists to stay and achieve their dreams here .
personally i feel i am not able to see my project or myself outside syria - to live and work outside syria , i feel i would lose my identity . "
significantly , perhaps , most of the musicians here are planning their future in syria .
while exact figures on the number of syrian returnees are not available , anecdotal evidence suggests many people are being attracted back .
the real test of the government 's success , though , will be whether members of the younger generation decide this is where they want to live too .

in a developed country you have slowly to climb the career ladder , but here you are part of a team that is taking the country to a different level , " he says .
it is a message the government - which estimates that 15 million syrians are living abroad , compared with 20 million at home - is keen to promote .

absent freedoms but for many returning syrians , the greater economic freedom does not fully make up for the lack of political freedom .
yousef abdalki , a well-known artist who went to france in the 1980s after being jailed for membership of the socialist labour party , has now returned to settle in his old home town .
" i came back because it is my right to come back .
i do n't think much has changed in the nature of authorities or their security control , but the global situation has changed .
" we still have people imprisoned for expressing their views .

while exact figures on the number of syrian returnees are not available , anecdotal evidence suggests many people are being attracted back .

in an annual report , the group says people are still being tortured or ill-treated in at least 81 countries .
in at least 54 states they face unfair trial and can not speak freely in at least 77 nations , the group adds .
it says world leaders should apologise for 60 years of human rights failures since the un adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 .
the group also challenges them " to re-commit themselves to deliver concrete improvements " .
us ' defiance ' the report - which covers 150 countries - was published ahead of the 60th anniversary of the human rights declaration , which was adopted on 10 december 1948 . "

" i think we have an opportunity during the 60th anniversary year to redress some of the problems since the terrible attacks on the united states , what we now call 911 , " she said .
but amnesty 's document accuses the us of failing to provide a moral compass for its international peers .
" as the world 's most powerful state , the usa sets the standard for government behaviour globally , " the report says .
it notes that washington " had distinguished itself in recent years through its defiance of international law " .
' ban all torture ' the report says the us must close the guantanamo bay detention camp for terror suspects and either prosecute the inmates under fair trials or free them .
it also urges washington to ban all forms of torture and stop propping authoritarian regimes .
it singles out the support of president george w bush 's administration for pakistani president pervez musharraf when he imposed a state of emergency , clamped down on media and sacked judges .
the report also says other leading nations must act to improve their human rights records : china is urged to adhere to its human rights promises and allow free speech and end " re-education through labour " russia is encouraged to show greater tolerance for political dissent , and none for impunity on human rights abuses in chechnya the eu is being asked to investigate the complicity of its member states in " renditions " of terror suspects .
' impotence ' have your say " leaders are failing to protect human rights and all for the reason of money and power " brandon , berlin send us your comments launching the document , amnesty international 's secretary general irene khan said : " injustice , inequality and impunity are the hallmarks of our world today .
" the human rights flashpoints in -lsb- sudan 's -rsb- darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar -lsb- burma -rsb- demand immediate action .
" 2007 was characterised by the impotence of western governments and the ambivalence or reluctance of emerging powers to tackle some of the world 's worst human rights crises . "
ms khan stressed that " governments must act now to close the yawning gap between promise and performance " .
she said : " 2008 presents an unprecedented opportunity for new leaders coming to power and countries emerging on the world stage to set a new direction and reject the myopic policies and practices that in recent years have made the world a more dangerous and divided place . "

in an annual report , the group says people are still being tortured or ill-treated in at least 81 countries .
in at least 54 states they face unfair trial and can not speak freely in at least 77 nations , the group adds .
it says world leaders should apologise for 60 years of human rights failures since the un adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 .
the group also challenges them " to re-commit themselves to deliver concrete improvements " .
us ' defiance ' the report - which covers 150 countries - was published ahead of the 60th anniversary of the human rights declaration , which was adopted on 10 december 1948 .
governments must act now to close the yawning gap between promise and performance irene khan amnesty international italy condemned for ' racism wave ' the state of the world 's human rights -lsb- 6.0mb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here mary robinson , who was from 1997 to 2002 the un high commissioner for human rights , said recognising the declaration was a very different matter from implementing it .
" i think we have an opportunity during the 60th anniversary year to redress some of the problems since the terrible attacks on the united states , what we now call 911 , " she said .
but amnesty 's document accuses the us of failing to provide a moral compass for its international peers .
" as the world 's most powerful state , the usa sets the standard for government behaviour globally , " the report says .
it notes that washington " had distinguished itself in recent years through its defiance of international law " .
' ban all torture ' the report says the us must close the guantanamo bay detention camp for terror suspects and either prosecute the inmates under fair trials or free them .
it also urges washington to ban all forms of torture and stop propping authoritarian regimes .
it singles out the support of president george w bush 's administration for pakistani president pervez musharraf when he imposed a state of emergency , clamped down on media and sacked judges .
the report also says other leading nations must act to improve their human rights records : china is urged to adhere to its human rights promises and allow free speech and end " re-education through labour " russia is encouraged to show greater tolerance for political dissent , and none for impunity on human rights abuses in chechnya the eu is being asked to investigate the complicity of its member states in " renditions " of terror suspects .
' impotence ' have your say leaders are failing to protect human rights and all for the reason of money and power brandon , berlin send us your comments launching the document , amnesty international 's secretary general irene khan said : " injustice , inequality and impunity are the hallmarks of our world today .
" the human rights flashpoints in -lsb- sudan 's -rsb- darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar -lsb- burma -rsb- demand immediate action .
" 2007 was characterised by the impotence of western governments and the ambivalence or reluctance of emerging powers to tackle some of the world 's worst human rights crises . "
ms khan stressed that " governments must act now to close the yawning gap between promise and performance " .
she said : " 2008 presents an unprecedented opportunity for new leaders coming to power and countries emerging on the world stage to set a new direction and reject the myopic policies and practices that in recent years have made the world a more dangerous and divided place . "

formal complaints totalled 123,089 in the last financial year , reversing the decline seen during the previous year .
the ombudsman said this was mainly due to a sharp rise in complaints about bank overdraft charges and payment protection insurance -lrb- ppi -rrb- .
most complaints made were turned down , apart from those regarding bank charges and credit cards .
" by the end of the 2007-08 financial year we had received more new complaints than in any year since the ombudsman service was established , " said the fos chairman sir christopher kelly .
bank charges the fos received nearly 32,000 bank charge complaints in just the first four months of the last financial year .
most common financial complaints 2007-08 bank charges 31,618 credit cards 14,123 mortgage endowments 13,778 payment protection insurance 10,652 that was nearly 10 times as many as in the whole previous year , reflecting the huge rise in consumer discontent over the issue .
but at the end of july it stopped dealing with any new or current cases .
that was part of the deal between the banks and the office of fair trading which led to all new cases being frozen in the banking and legal system , as part of a plan to ask the high court to resolve the legal issues involved .
as a result , 14,000 bank charge complaints were put on ice at the fos .
the litigation to decide the fairness of bank overdraft charges is now likely to last well into next year so it will probably not be until then that the fos re-examines its cases .
" it 's massively unfair and is to be deplored , " said marc gander of the consumer action group .
" many thousands more people are stuck in the courts , unable to enforce their rights while the banks are allowed to continue applying their charges unfettered , " he added .
payment protection insurance a sudden surge in complaints about ppi hit the fos in the first three months of 2008 , prompted by media and internet campaigns on the issue . "
if you have a loan and think you might have been mis-sold ppi , now 's the time to fight back " doug taylor , which ?
there were 10,652 complaints for the whole of 2007-08 , up significantly from 1,832 the year before .
the consumers association which ? claimed that as many as two million people may have been mis-sold ppi policies in the past five years .
" we 've always known that people were being mis-sold ppi , but we were still amazed to discover the scale of it , " said doug taylor of which ?
" if you have a loan and think you might have been mis-sold ppi , now 's the time to fight back , " he added .
resolution the fact that thousands of bank charge complaints were put on hold contributed to an 11 % drop in the number of all cases actually resolved by the ombudsman .
these fell by 11 % from 2006-07 to 99,699 .
an additional reason was the difficulty in resolving some of the remaining complaints about the mis-selling of mortgage endowment policies .
these used to be the single biggest source of complaint but have dwindled sharply in the past few years .
overall the number of new cases dropped in one year from 46,134 to just 13,778 .
however the fact that some of the remaining complaints were more difficult to deal with meant that they took longer than before to resolve .
claims handling the ombudsman noted that 19 % of all complaints came from claims handling businesses which typically take a cut of any compensation they gain .
the fos said in some cases the complainants were not being represented properly .
" in the specific context of pension-related complaints involving serps , we have seen a significant number of cases this year where some claims-management companies have given consumers unrealistic expectations of large sums of compensation in cash , without appearing first to have properly assessed the actual merits of the individual cases , " said the fos report .
despite the upsurge in complaints overall , approaching the fos is not a one-way ticket to success .
only 32 % of complaints about mortgage endowments were upheld .
most other areas of complaint - covering banking , investment and insurance - also saw the ombudsman uphold a majority of the decisions made by the financial services companies .
only for current account complaints -lrb- 84 % -rrb- and credit cards -lrb- 79 % -rrb- did consumers win most of their claims .

formal complaints totalled 123,089 in the last financial year , reversing the decline seen during the previous year .
the ombudsman said this was mainly due to a sharp rise in complaints about bank overdraft charges and payment protection insurance -lrb- ppi -rrb- .
most complaints made were turned down , apart from those regarding bank charges and credit cards .
" by the end of the 2007-08 financial year we had received more new complaints than in any year since the ombudsman service was established , " said the fos chairman sir christopher kelly .
bank charges the fos received nearly 32,000 bank charge complaints in just the first four months of the last financial year .
most common financial complaints 2007-08 bank charges 31,618 credit cards 14,123 mortgage endowments 13,778 payment protection insurance 10,652 that was nearly 10 times as many as in the whole previous year , reflecting the huge rise in consumer discontent over the issue .
but at the end of july it stopped dealing with any new or current cases .
that was part of the deal between the banks and the office of fair trading which led to all new cases being frozen in the banking and legal system , as part of a plan to ask the high court to resolve the legal issues involved .
as a result , 14,000 bank charge complaints were put on ice at the fos .
the litigation to decide the fairness of bank overdraft charges is now likely to last well into next year so it will probably not be until then that the fos re-examines its cases .
" it 's massively unfair and is to be deplored , " said marc gander of the consumer action group .
" many thousands more people are stuck in the courts , unable to enforce their rights while the banks are allowed to continue applying their charges unfettered , " he added .
payment protection insurance a sudden surge in complaints about ppi hit the fos in the first three months of 2008 , prompted by media and internet campaigns on the issue .

the two-mile convoy of more than 150 lorries travelled from west wales to cardiff on tuesday to protest at fuel costs .
organisers say they want fuel duty to be cut within seven days .
both the uk and assembly governments said they understood the pressures brought by rising fuel costs .
the treasury said it was addressing the situation .
prime minister gordon brown and chancellor alistair darling will meet leaders of the oil industry in scotland on wednesday morning to discuss ways of increasing production .
the convoy in wales on tuesday was part of a day of fuel price protests across the uk , including a convoy which headed to downing street .
plans to head to the welsh assembly in cardiff bay to hand in a petition were changed after negotiations with police .
the organisers of the welsh protest said haulage firms were being driven to the wall by the high cost of diesel and a planned two pence rise in fuel duty .
they are calling for an " essential user " rebate of between 20 and 25 pence per litre for hgv drivers .
organiser mike greene said the hauliers are giving gordon brown a deadline of a week to cut fuel duty by between 20 to 25 pence per litre - or they will blockade refineries .
speaking on the bbc news channel , mr greene claimed hauliers across the country feel the same .
the protest , which was over by mid-afternoon , saw m4 eastbound traffic at a standstill or crawling along at about 5 mph as hauliers drove from carmarthenshire .
a maximum of 50 vehicles entered the cardiff west services car park at junction 33 of the m4 after an agreement was reached with the hauliers to avoid going into the city .
a petition was handed to nick bourne , leader of the conservatives in the welsh assembly , and tory am and transport spokesman andrew rt davies .
after the protest , south wales police said a driver from the convoy was issued with a warning for a public order offence after leaving his vehicle on the motorway and urinating on the hard shoulder . "
people will have to stop working sooner or later because there 's no point working for a loss " martin arthur , owner of haulage firm martin arthur , 54 , who was at the services and who owns a haulage firm in usk , said : " the cost of diesel is going up almost every day .
we 're just handing all our money over .
" people will have to stop working sooner or later because there 's no point working for a loss . "
public transport dave lasky , of bob gay plant hire , llantwit fardre , said : " i wanted to come today because i 'm only 24 and it 's affecting me more than the older guys .
" i 've got other bills to pay , and i 've to pay for my car .
something has to be done or i will lose my job . "
a treasury spokesperson said fuel prices had risen by more than 19 % since this time last year .
the spokesman said : " to respond to short-term pressures , the 2008 budget announced that the 2p per litre fuel duty increase , scheduled for 1 april , will be deferred until 1 october . "
the assembly government said : " the price of fuel - and the duties imposed on it by the uk government - are not the responsibility of the assembly government .
the spokesman said , however , the issue would be raised with the uk government because of the impact on the haulage industry , transport services and individual motorists in wales .
mike childs , friends of the earth 's head of campaigns , said despite fuel price rises , the overall cost of motoring has gone down in real terms - but the cost of public transport has risen .
he said : " rising oil prices and the impending threat from global climate change mean the government must take urgent action to ensure our addiction to oil does n't set us on the road to ruin .
" government must fast track investment in public transport and backing for smarter cars that use less petrol so our society is not held to ransom by our reliance on a dwindling and insecure natural resource , " he added .

the convoy in wales on tuesday was part of a day of fuel price protests across the uk , including a convoy which headed to downing street .

a maximum of 50 vehicles entered the cardiff west services car park at junction 33 of the m4 after an agreement was reached with the hauliers to avoid going into the city .
a petition was handed to nick bourne , leader of the conservatives in the welsh assembly , and tory am and transport spokesman andrew rt davies .
