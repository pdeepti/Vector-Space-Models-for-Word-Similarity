21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .
both germany and belgium have recognized the new state , angering serbia . no partition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ruled out the possibility of partition answering a question as to whether the west could prevent kosovo 's ethnic serb regions breaking away from the new state , steinmeier said that " even if that intention is lodged in the minds of some people , " it could be prevented . steinmeier said the european union 's objective in kosovo had always been " to ensure a democratic but also a multi-ethnic future . "
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future . " eu mission deemed illegal by some the eu has launched a 2,000-strong mission to supervise and advise the kosovo police and help the judicial sector .

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .

however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .

bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .

liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .
both germany and belgium have recognized the new state , angering serbia . no partition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ruled out the possibility of partition answering a question as to whether the west could prevent kosovo 's ethnic serb regions breaking away from the new state , steinmeier said that " even if that intention is lodged in the minds of some people , " it could be prevented . steinmeier said the european union 's objective in kosovo had always been " to ensure a democratic but also a multi-ethnic future . "
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future . " eu mission deemed illegal by some the eu has launched a 2,000-strong mission to supervise and advise the kosovo police and help the judicial sector .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .

exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .
both germany and belgium have recognized the new state , angering serbia . no partition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ruled out the possibility of partition answering a question as to whether the west could prevent kosovo 's ethnic serb regions breaking away from the new state , steinmeier said that " even if that intention is lodged in the minds of some people , " it could be prevented . steinmeier said the european union 's objective in kosovo had always been " to ensure a democratic but also a multi-ethnic future . "
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future . " eu mission deemed illegal by some the eu has launched a 2,000-strong mission to supervise and advise the kosovo police and help the judicial sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.02.2008 germans attracted to cuba 's investment needs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba sells itself as colorful and lively place , and investors are anxious to be part of it since fidel castro formally announced his retreat from power in cuba , foreign firms have begun to hope the island will soon open up to business .
there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .
the past 50 years of that approach had had no effect , they said . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .
the past 50 years of that approach had had no effect , they said . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .
both germany and belgium have recognized the new state , angering serbia . no partition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ruled out the possibility of partition answering a question as to whether the west could prevent kosovo 's ethnic serb regions breaking away from the new state , steinmeier said that " even if that intention is lodged in the minds of some people , " it could be prevented . steinmeier said the european union 's objective in kosovo had always been " to ensure a democratic but also a multi-ethnic future . "
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future . " eu mission deemed illegal by some the eu has launched a 2,000-strong mission to supervise and advise the kosovo police and help the judicial sector .
the mission will take over powers from the existing un operation by mid-june . belgrade and russia however insist that the eu presence is illegal and without a proper un mandate . kosovo has been under united nations administration since 1999 , when nato drove serbian forces out of the territory . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .

the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .

german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .

the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .

german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .
the past 50 years of that approach had had no effect , they said . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .

police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .

"
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .

germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .

liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .

21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .
the past 50 years of that approach had had no effect , they said . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.02.2008 germans attracted to cuba 's investment needs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba sells itself as colorful and lively place , and investors are anxious to be part of it since fidel castro formally announced his retreat from power in cuba , foreign firms have begun to hope the island will soon open up to business .
there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .
the past 50 years of that approach had had no effect , they said . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .

"
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "
both ministers said the objective must be to develop kosovo so that it became self-sustaining , with de gucht saying the key was " to invest in the future .

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany demands greater transparency from liechtenstein chancellor angela merkel demanded greater insight into german investments in the tiny alpine principality during a berlin visit by liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler , amid an ever-widening tax evasion scandal .
-lrb- 20.02.2008 -rrb- who 's to blame for germany 's massive tax evasion scandal ?
chancellor merkel is to press liechtenstein 's leader about his nation 's role as a tax haven for hundreds of rich germans in one of the biggest scandals to hit the eu power .

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many demonstrators said serbia would never accept the loss of its cultural heartland the week has seen more than 200,000 protestors gather in belgrade for an emotive rally against kosovo 's declaration of independence . according to reuters , hospital officials say that some 150 people have been injured in street clashes , including 30 police - while the rioters have also looted and vandalized shops and banks . initially , thousands of people walked to the " kosovo is serbia " demonstration in front of the old yugoslav parliament in downtown belgrade .
many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .

many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .

21 , state department spokesman sean mccormack said . burns " made very clear to the foreign minister that we would hold the serbian government personally responsible for the safety and the well-being of our embassy employees , " mccormack said . he added that all us staff were safe , but said that one as yet unidentified person died when the rioters set the building on fire , reported afp .
the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .
the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " said foreign minister vuk jeremic .

many waved serbian national flags , chanting , " we 'll never give up kosovo , never ! " " as long as we live , kosovo is serbia , " prime minister vojislav kostunica told the crowd from a stage . " we 're not alone in our fight .
president putin is with us , " kostunica said , referring to the russian leader who has opposed us and european states ' recognition of kosovo . serbia remains vehemently opposed to kosovo 's independence .
the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .
21 . a group of 400 pelted around 100 police officers with rocks and hurled burning tires at the border crossing point of merdare in southern serbia .
police erected metal barricades and barbed wire as a helicopter of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force monitored the situation from the sky . troops from nato 's 17,000-strong kfor force intervened earlier this week when violence flared up at another border crossing after protests by ethnic serbs . " the right decision " meeting in slovenia to review security arrangements for the region , european union defense ministers remained confident that nato and eu troops could hold the peace in the balkans . german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday 's events , where nato forces needed to intervene , showed local police in kosovo could not ensure security by themselves , but said it demonstrated good cooperation on the ground between nato and the united nations personnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said kfor troops are keeping the peace " in particular thanks to the support of kfor , things are under control , " jung , who returned from a trip to pristina , told reporters .
replying to a question about whether he was concerned that ethnic tensions could spill over into multi-ethnic bosnia , where the eu has 2,500 troops in a peace force inherited from nato in 2004 , jung said : " we have seen no indications of that so far . " speaking in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on thursday the kfor peacekeeping force " has the capability for us to prevent " any partition of kosovo . he was speaking after meeting with belgian foreign minister karel de gucht in berlin to discuss the diplomatic fallout from sunday 's kosovo declaration of independence .
both germany and belgium have recognized the new state , angering serbia . no partition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ruled out the possibility of partition answering a question as to whether the west could prevent kosovo 's ethnic serb regions breaking away from the new state , steinmeier said that " even if that intention is lodged in the minds of some people , " it could be prevented . steinmeier said the european union 's objective in kosovo had always been " to ensure a democratic but also a multi-ethnic future . "
de gucht said , " europe has taken the right decision . " the belgian minister added he hoped that serbia would be willing to resume cooperation with the european union " sooner rather than later . "

there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .
liechtenstein 's head of state , prince alois , said on thursday he wanted to smooth differences between the two nations and end the " ping-pong game " between berlin and vaduz . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .

" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return it should finally be expected to stop undermining eu members ' tax systems , writes dw 's monika dittrich . liechtenstein offers plenty of opportunities for greedy tax evaders .
the small alpine state enriches itself with money that is illegally taken away from other countries .
it makes the lawbreakers anonymous and protects them and their millions . this is reprehensible .
the government in liechtenstein should be expected to dry out this sleazy swamp and adhere to european transparency laws . when the royal house in vaduz claims there is competition among tax systems and that they are not to blame for criminals in germany , they may be right - but that 's only half the truth . more than turning a blind eye liechtenstein aids tax criminals not only by allowing tax evasion but by provoking it .
with its system of banks , foundations , trusts and deceptive laws , the principality encourages investors to funnel their money away from the tax authorities in other countries . tax evasion abroad is not an offense in liechtenstein , and vaduz does not offer legal assistance to authorities investigating such cases .
due to the excessive policy of bankers ' confidentiality , tax investigators are n't given any information about the accounts of potential black sheep . and liechtenstein even makes a profit with the business . why should the eu tolerate these practices ?
liechtenstein may not be a member , but it happily benefits from the bloc .
its membership in the european single market since 1995 , for example , has helped its economy .
and the small state is set to become a member of schengen agreement and will soon take advantage of free travel throughout the entire visa-free area . quid pro quo with europe but europe is not a one-way street .
those who want the benefits also have to give something in return - like cooperating with tax authorities .
brussels and the eu states finally have to put pressure on liechtenstein and impose consequences if necessary . it 's not acceptable for the principality to hold on to its antiquated practice of bankers ' confidentiality and not provide any official assistance , even in investigations against the worst tax criminals . europe has to eliminate the tax loophole in its midst . monika dittrich is a reporter for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the casualty appears to be a protestor . " we received assurances from prime minister kostunica that there would not be a repeat of this episode , " he went on .
" we have seen a lot of disturbing reports about statements by serbian government officials … about incitement to violence .
this has to cease , " he stressed . hurting serbia 's image abroad meanwhile , the us state department complained about the lack of protection for its mission - pointing to the fact that police were nowhere near the scene when the attack was launched . germany , croatia and britain also suffered damage to their missions , according to reuters . but the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .

the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany and france , have recognized the state . the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutal crimes against the ethnic albanian population under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . more violence on kosovo-serb border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic serbs set fire to un vehicles at a border crossing earlier in the week meanwhile , in the second violent incident on the kosovo-serbian border since sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia by kosovo 's ethnic albanian-dominated parliament , several hundred former serbian army reservists attacked kosovo police on thursday , feb .

germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that a few private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
spotlight on german private banks the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report said some bank customers were explicitly advised about sheltering money in liechtenstein " we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
however , a few private banks , targeted by tax authorities in recent days as part of nation-wide raids on suspected tax cheats and financial institutions , denied the allegations .
a spokesman for one such bank , hauck & aufhaeuser , told dpa that the bank was not allowed to advise clients in tax affairs .
juicy scandal the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , first broke with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's high-flying career is severely tainted by the scandal ever since , authorities , armed with a list of 100 tax evaders , have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations .
this week german investigators searched homes and offices in frankfurt , munich , hamburg and berlin , including branch offices of dresdner bank and ubs . the affair has prompted a heated debate in germany about the morals and accountability of the country 's well-paid business elite .
equally , attention has focused on the way the scandal has come to light .
bearing the hallmarks of a gripping thriller , germany 's foreign intelligence agency , bnd , is reported to have paid up to five million euros to an anonymous informant , allegedly a former disgruntled employee of the lgt group in liechtenstein , for a disc containing the names of hundreds of german tax cheats .
germany 's opposition parties have criticized the government for accepting and paying for what they say is stolen information .
bnd chief ernst uhrlau , however , told a parliamentary investigation committee that the man who spilled the explosive information was neither a fraud nor a former employee of the lgt group with a previous criminal record .
politician calls liechtenstein a " rogue state " the affair has also strained germany 's ties with the tiny principality of liechtenstein and sparked discussion on tackling tax havens .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
the probe has led politicians in germany to call for radical action against liechtenstein , the smallest german-speaking country in the world .
joachim poss , financial affairs expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- accused the principality of systematically abetting tax fraud .
" their behavior reminds one of a rogue state , " poss said in an interview with german broadcaster , swr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chill in the air - merkel with liechtenstein premier otmar hasler the tax evasion scandal has passions running high beyond german borders too .
pierre mirabaud , chairman of the swiss bankers ' association lent his support to embattled liechtenstein on thursday , slamming the methods used by german tax investigators .
" these are methods that unfortunately remind you of gestapo methods , " mirabaud told a swiss tv station , referring to the dreaded secret police during the nazi era .
mirabaud later said he regretted the comparision .
german chancellor merkel on wednesday pressed liechtenstein on its role in abetting tax evasion and raised the prospect of retaliation unless she receives more cooperation on tax policy from the principality .
merkel said she expected liechtenstein to show progress in talks with the european union on combating fraud and for it to implement a new eu money-laundering directive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.02.2008 germans attracted to cuba 's investment needs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba sells itself as colorful and lively place , and investors are anxious to be part of it since fidel castro formally announced his retreat from power in cuba , foreign firms have begun to hope the island will soon open up to business .
there are already indications it may . as the world 's media reported castro 's retirement , on tuesday , feb .
19 , germany 's business community was analyzing the situation .
the comandante 's withdrawal was a " striking turning point , " said commercial lawyer frank seifert , head of the german-cuba business union , but it came as no surprise .
" this step had been in preparation for a long time , " he said .
indeed , nothing is feared as much in cuba as radical change .
the transition from the castro era to his likely successor , raul castro , was intended to be a smooth one .
" the people are afraid that the little they have will be at risk if the change comes too quickly , " seifert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cubans are afraid they could loose out if the island opens up more that fear is understandable given the powerful groups of exile cubans in florida waiting impatiently for the moment they can reclaim property of which they were dispossessed .
" politically , we do n't expect a change , but we do expect an economic opening , " said peter roesler of germany 's ibero-america club .
decaying industry there are indications that change may be in store .
raul castro has called on cubans to identify the weaknesses of the socialist system and to submit suggestions for improvement .
media loyal to the government have begun to report - with unusual outspokenness - about economic grievances .
seifert , who has advised companies on investing in cuba since 1995 , said he foresees new opportunities for german and other foreign firms looking to do business with the island state .
" cuba is an investment country with massive pent-up demand , " he said .
" cuba is the gate to the caribbean .
it has a magnificently educated population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro -lrb- l . -rrb- and his brother raul , who is 76 investment is also needed in every sector of the cuban economy .
the infrastructure is inadequate , the industrial facilities are out-of-date an in many areas there 's a lack of modern technology .
high hurdles whether generators , medical technology or diesel motors , an ever-increasing stream of products is already making its way from germany to cuba .
exports to cuba amounted to 412 million euros -lrb- $ 606 million -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's foreign ministry .
however , investing in cuba involves fulfilling myriad regulations and overcoming daunting bureaucratic hurdles .
in addition , cuban business conduct takes some getting used to and companies can be fickle when it comes to dealing with accounts payable .
cuba 's 1995 foreign investment legislation requires foreign companies to work with a cuban partner from the same sector and to get state permission to do business on the island .
the german foreign ministry put the number of joint ventures and international business associations with foreign firms in cuba at 236 , with the investments from venezuela and china increasing especially strongly .
contingent on us change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 us congressman and women said their country 's policy toward cuba had been a failure the german engagement was " laughable , " seifert said .
german firms were involved in only six joint ventures , which included daimler as well as entrepreneur stefan messer , who produces industrial gases and is one of the most important german investors on the island .
many more companies would like to invest in cuba , and socialism is n't the only deterrence .
they are put off by the united states ' blockade on trade with cuba . " laws with ex-territorial effects " like the 1996 helms-burton act , which allows us courts to penalize foreign firms that trade with cuba , should be shelved , roesler said .
companies active in cuba risk being barred from the us market .
but the us wo n't be able to sustain its blockade much longer , according to seifert .
the economic embargo , in effect since 1962 , has been subject to mounting criticism in the united states .
on tuesday , over 100 members of congress called on secretary of state condoleezza rice to change the country 's approach to cuba .
politicians from both the democratic and republican parties have declared the policy of sanctions and isolation aimed at eliciting change in cuba a failure .

the charismatic illinois senator is drawing big crowds at campaign rallies in a phenomenon known as obamamania .
kenya , where senator obama 's father came from , is not immune from this either , but here , another obama is riding on the crest of a wave .
this one , though , comes in the form of a brown bottle and is called senator beer .
in many slums and low income areas , people who find beer too expensive often resort to cheap home brews .
but these potent drinks which include traditional spirits known as chang 'aa have on a several occasions proved lethal .
some consumers have died and others have been blinded .
it 's believed brewers spike the beer with deadly additives .
so one brewery , east african breweries limited -lrb- eabl -rrb- , spotted a market opportunity for a cheap beer that is also safe .
the result : senator keg beer , known simply by drinkers as " obama " .
the beer became an instant hit when it was launched in 2004 at about the same time as barack obama was elected as senator of illinois .
fears of alcoholism the product has proved as popular as the us senator in the intervening years , but with more beer for less money there are fears it could contribute to a rise in alcoholism in kenya .
eabl 's corporate affairs director ken kariuki rejects this .
he says that normally poorer people are consuming drinks with an alcohol content of around 40 % .
by contrast senator beer is only 6 % .
" so you are almost forcing a responsible consumption of alcohol , only this time you 're packaging the product in a more affordable and hygienic manner , " mr kariuki explains .
but others are worried that cheap beer can create more alcoholics .
dr frank njenga , chairman of the national campaign against drug abuse , says more needs to be done to tackle alcohol abuse .
" alcohol problems require the intervention by all the players , chief of which is the government through its agencies and also those in the industry , " he says .
dr njenga , who is also a prominent psychiatrist in nairobi , says everyone must work together to combat the rising trend of alcohol consumption .
certainly bar owners are not complaining .
on a good day , john kameta , who owns the bro jimmoh bar in nairobi , can make up to $ 100 from sales of senator beer .
" with the high cost of living , people from across all income brackets are turning to obama beer each evening , " he says .
so what do kenyans make of the new liquid obama ?
" i like the way it is served - from a jug , instead of a bottle .
most people think you get a larger serving from a jug , " one devotee told me .
so while the outcome of the us elections may not matter as much in kenya as it does in america , here every visit to the local watering hole is a vote of confidence in their obama .

the charismatic illinois senator is drawing big crowds at campaign rallies in a phenomenon known as obamamania .
kenya , where senator obama 's father came from , is not immune from this either , but here , another obama is riding on the crest of a wave .
this one , though , comes in the form of a brown bottle and is called senator beer .
in many slums and low income areas , people who find beer too expensive often resort to cheap home brews .
but these potent drinks which include traditional spirits known as chang 'aa have on a several occasions proved lethal .
some consumers have died and others have been blinded .
it 's believed brewers spike the beer with deadly additives .
so one brewery , east african breweries limited -lrb- eabl -rrb- , spotted a market opportunity for a cheap beer that is also safe .
the result : senator keg beer , known simply by drinkers as " obama " .
the beer became an instant hit when it was launched in 2004 at about the same time as barack obama was elected as senator of illinois .
fears of alcoholism the product has proved as popular as the us senator in the intervening years , but with more beer for less money there are fears it could contribute to a rise in alcoholism in kenya .
eabl 's corporate affairs director ken kariuki rejects this .
he says that normally poorer people are consuming drinks with an alcohol content of around 40 % .
by contrast senator beer is only 6 % .
barack obama could be the first black president of the united states " so you are almost forcing a responsible consumption of alcohol , only this time you 're packaging the product in a more affordable and hygienic manner , " mr kariuki explains .
but others are worried that cheap beer can create more alcoholics .
dr frank njenga , chairman of the national campaign against drug abuse , says more needs to be done to tackle alcohol abuse .
" alcohol problems require the intervention by all the players , chief of which is the government through its agencies and also those in the industry , " he says .
dr njenga , who is also a prominent psychiatrist in nairobi , says everyone must work together to combat the rising trend of alcohol consumption .
certainly bar owners are not complaining .
on a good day , john kameta , who owns the bro jimmoh bar in nairobi , can make up to $ 100 from sales of senator beer .
" with the high cost of living , people from across all income brackets are turning to obama beer each evening , " he says .
so what do kenyans make of the new liquid obama ?
" i like the way it is served - from a jug , instead of a bottle .
most people think you get a larger serving from a jug , " one devotee told me .
so while the outcome of the us elections may not matter as much in kenya as it does in america , here every visit to the local watering hole is a vote of confidence in their obama .

science fiction trading game eve online is one of the most dynamic worlds , with its own economists helping players get to grips with the intricacies .
more than 220,000 people pay a subscription to play eve online , a game set in a vast universe of more than 5,000 solar systems distributed over 66 regions .
players battle to win territories through forming corporations and creating , buying and selling products - it is a virtual microcosm of the economic world at large .
dr eyjo gudmundsson is the lead economist , a virtual alan greenspan , who works to make sense of all the data .
he said : " within the game i supply players with economic information so they can make decisions about their own production , what they are going to produce and how they are going to produce it .
" it 's basically the same economic questions as in real life .
it 's about strategy and an important part about strategic decisions is logistics and having access to the resources you need to win your war .
corporate espionage is a very big part of the game dr eyjo gudmundsson " it 's like a real war in the sense you have to plan ahead .
it 's about long-term planning and long-term strategy . "
every quarter dr gudmundsson and his team produce an economic newsletter analysing trends inside the game .
" we are looking at markets , at production and long-term trends that show the movements of the players .
" we publish basic information on price levels and production values and interesting demographic information so players can rank themselves .
just like in a real economy , you want to have a benchmark . "
the newsletter goes into great detail on the trade of virtual minerals in the game and where players are travelling in the universe .
with such depth and complexity , it is hardly surprising that eve online attracts a good number of senior executives and business professionals .
dr gudmundsson said : " it 's the challenge of being able to be the best at planning ahead , the one who controls a large territory , showing your skills in running a corporation that has up to 1,000 members . "
he added : " it 's gamers who want something other than the first person shooter .
they are using their skills , and learning skills about business , production and management , and having fun in a very competitive environment . "
the complexity of the world of eve is also leading to collaboration between the game and real world academic institutions .
" i work with research institutes who are interested in learning from our experiences , " said the economist .
eve 's players battle across the universe " we have one project with the helsinki institute of research technology where we are looking into how to evaluate virtual economies and comparing that to other virtual worlds and moving that experience over to the real world .
" eve is a game based on trade and there have been a couple of cases of price bubbles and it would be interesting to do a comparative study , comparing these bubbles to the real world and seeing how expectations are controlling the market at any given time . "
one way that the virtual world reflects the real is in the realm of crime and fraud .
" eve is a very competitive game and is happening in a super-capitalistic environment - corporate espionage is a very big part of the game .
" everybody assumes there must be one spy in the ranks .
there have been examples of corporate thefts , where people have earned the trust of others for months before attacking that corporation . "
but the game 's architects are not automatically moving to stamp out such practices .
" we are discussing this with players .
to what extent should we provide protection for players . "
with such emotional , temporal and financial investment in the game , eve 's players are beginning to have a larger say in its future .
a number of players will help form a council of stellar management which will discuss the game 's mechanics with eve 's creators .
and in keeping with the game , players will have to be elected to the group , creating a complex series of elections within the virtual world .
dr gudmundsson will be working with academic bodies in iceland to look at how the voting process works .
for example , does it follow rules established in the real world ?
so what has he learned about how the economy of eve works ?
" i have been quite surprised by how effective the markets are .
the biggest markets for the most basic products , such as minerals , are showing a very high degree of efficiency .
" eve is a great place to learn business skills , or to sharpen business skills .
players have written to us to say that they have gone on to establish successful businesses after playing eve . "

science fiction trading game eve online is one of the most dynamic worlds , with its own economists helping players get to grips with the intricacies .
more than 220,000 people pay a subscription to play eve online , a game set in a vast universe of more than 5,000 solar systems distributed over 66 regions .
players battle to win territories through forming corporations and creating , buying and selling products - it is a virtual microcosm of the economic world at large .
dr eyjo gudmundsson is the lead economist , a virtual alan greenspan , who works to make sense of all the data .
he said : " within the game i supply players with economic information so they can make decisions about their own production , what they are going to produce and how they are going to produce it .
" it 's basically the same economic questions as in real life .
it 's about strategy and an important part about strategic decisions is logistics and having access to the resources you need to win your war .
corporate espionage is a very big part of the game dr eyjo gudmundsson " it 's like a real war in the sense you have to plan ahead .
it 's about long-term planning and long-term strategy . "
every quarter dr gudmundsson and his team produce an economic newsletter analysing trends inside the game .
" we are looking at markets , at production and long-term trends that show the movements of the players .
" we publish basic information on price levels and production values and interesting demographic information so players can rank themselves .
just like in a real economy , you want to have a benchmark . "
the newsletter goes into great detail on the trade of virtual minerals in the game and where players are travelling in the universe .
with such depth and complexity , it is hardly surprising that eve online attracts a good number of senior executives and business professionals .
dr gudmundsson said : " it 's the challenge of being able to be the best at planning ahead , the one who controls a large territory , showing your skills in running a corporation that has up to 1,000 members . "
he added : " it 's gamers who want something other than the first person shooter .
they are using their skills , and learning skills about business , production and management , and having fun in a very competitive environment . "
the complexity of the world of eve is also leading to collaboration between the game and real world academic institutions .
" i work with research institutes who are interested in learning from our experiences , " said the economist .
eve 's players battle across the universe " we have one project with the helsinki institute of research technology where we are looking into how to evaluate virtual economies and comparing that to other virtual worlds and moving that experience over to the real world .
" eve is a game based on trade and there have been a couple of cases of price bubbles and it would be interesting to do a comparative study , comparing these bubbles to the real world and seeing how expectations are controlling the market at any given time . "
one way that the virtual world reflects the real is in the realm of crime and fraud .
" eve is a very competitive game and is happening in a super-capitalistic environment - corporate espionage is a very big part of the game .
" everybody assumes there must be one spy in the ranks .
there have been examples of corporate thefts , where people have earned the trust of others for months before attacking that corporation . "
but the game 's architects are not automatically moving to stamp out such practices .
" we are discussing this with players .
to what extent should we provide protection for players . "
with such emotional , temporal and financial investment in the game , eve 's players are beginning to have a larger say in its future .
a number of players will help form a council of stellar management which will discuss the game 's mechanics with eve 's creators .
and in keeping with the game , players will have to be elected to the group , creating a complex series of elections within the virtual world .
dr gudmundsson will be working with academic bodies in iceland to look at how the voting process works .
for example , does it follow rules established in the real world ?
so what has he learned about how the economy of eve works ?
" i have been quite surprised by how effective the markets are .
the biggest markets for the most basic products , such as minerals , are showing a very high degree of efficiency .
" eve is a great place to learn business skills , or to sharpen business skills .
players have written to us to say that they have gone on to establish successful businesses after playing eve . "

science fiction trading game eve online is one of the most dynamic worlds , with its own economists helping players get to grips with the intricacies .
more than 220,000 people pay a subscription to play eve online , a game set in a vast universe of more than 5,000 solar systems distributed over 66 regions .
players battle to win territories through forming corporations and creating , buying and selling products - it is a virtual microcosm of the economic world at large .
dr eyjo gudmundsson is the lead economist , a virtual alan greenspan , who works to make sense of all the data .
he said : " within the game i supply players with economic information so they can make decisions about their own production , what they are going to produce and how they are going to produce it .
" it 's basically the same economic questions as in real life .
it 's about strategy and an important part about strategic decisions is logistics and having access to the resources you need to win your war .
corporate espionage is a very big part of the game dr eyjo gudmundsson " it 's like a real war in the sense you have to plan ahead .
it 's about long-term planning and long-term strategy . "
every quarter dr gudmundsson and his team produce an economic newsletter analysing trends inside the game .
" we are looking at markets , at production and long-term trends that show the movements of the players .
" we publish basic information on price levels and production values and interesting demographic information so players can rank themselves .
just like in a real economy , you want to have a benchmark . "
the newsletter goes into great detail on the trade of virtual minerals in the game and where players are travelling in the universe .
with such depth and complexity , it is hardly surprising that eve online attracts a good number of senior executives and business professionals .
dr gudmundsson said : " it 's the challenge of being able to be the best at planning ahead , the one who controls a large territory , showing your skills in running a corporation that has up to 1,000 members . "
he added : " it 's gamers who want something other than the first person shooter .
they are using their skills , and learning skills about business , production and management , and having fun in a very competitive environment . "
the complexity of the world of eve is also leading to collaboration between the game and real world academic institutions .
" i work with research institutes who are interested in learning from our experiences , " said the economist .
eve 's players battle across the universe " we have one project with the helsinki institute of research technology where we are looking into how to evaluate virtual economies and comparing that to other virtual worlds and moving that experience over to the real world .
" eve is a game based on trade and there have been a couple of cases of price bubbles and it would be interesting to do a comparative study , comparing these bubbles to the real world and seeing how expectations are controlling the market at any given time . "
one way that the virtual world reflects the real is in the realm of crime and fraud .
" eve is a very competitive game and is happening in a super-capitalistic environment - corporate espionage is a very big part of the game .
" everybody assumes there must be one spy in the ranks .
there have been examples of corporate thefts , where people have earned the trust of others for months before attacking that corporation . "
but the game 's architects are not automatically moving to stamp out such practices .
" we are discussing this with players .
to what extent should we provide protection for players . "
with such emotional , temporal and financial investment in the game , eve 's players are beginning to have a larger say in its future .
a number of players will help form a council of stellar management which will discuss the game 's mechanics with eve 's creators .
and in keeping with the game , players will have to be elected to the group , creating a complex series of elections within the virtual world .
dr gudmundsson will be working with academic bodies in iceland to look at how the voting process works .
for example , does it follow rules established in the real world ?
so what has he learned about how the economy of eve works ?
" i have been quite surprised by how effective the markets are .

not so , doctors warn there was a point last year when , for the first time ever , every neo-natal care bed in the country was taken .
doctors have put this down in part to the growing number of babies born as a result of ivf .
this can produce many multiple births - infants who are often premature and sickly , and therefore in need of intensive and expensive specialist care .
the foremost fertility minds are currently at work to try to find ways to reduce the number of twins and triplets born as a result of these procedures , which often involve the implantation of as many as three embryos .
for many women , this may well maximise the chance of a successful pregnancy , but at a price .
" one of the real obstacles is persuading parents that twins are not ' two for the price of one " ' , says dr gillian lockwood , medical director of midland fertility services .
" i see these babies all the time - tiny things who often have real problems - but parents do n't always understand the risks - or if they do , are prepared to take them if it means they end up with a baby . "
last chance saloon a quarter of ivf babies are twins or triplets : multiple births are nearly 20 times higher as a result of assisted conception that when it happens spontaneously .
ivf in the uk 30,000 treated every year 25 % of births multiple less than 5 % of pcts offer three cycles private treatment costs up to £ 6,000 however they are conceived , those who share a womb with siblings are far more likely to be born prematurely - and this brings with it a series of risks .
twins are seven times more likely to die in the first few weeks of life than their singleton counterparts , and are six times more likely to develop cerebral palsy .
but for many infertile couples these are chances worth taking .
" it 's true that for some couples twins are seen as highly desirable , double the joy , and many simply have n't had the risks properly explained , " says susan seenan of infertility network uk .
" but it 's a very complicated picture .
many couples are afraid they are only going to get one shot at this - because of the costs , because nhs treatment can be very limited - and they want to maximise their chances of having a baby at all .
they ca n't afford to keep doing it . "
see it as disease , please privately , one cycle of ivf can cost as much as £ 6,000 .
what other nhs treatment for £ 3,000 gives you a much loved , much wanted baby , who before long will be paying their taxes ?
it 's very good value dr gillian lockwood midland fertility services guidelines drawn up in 2004 recommended that infertile couples received three cycles of ivf on the nhs , but in the most recent survey less than five percent of primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- said they provided as many as this .
the majority would only fund one , and many attached their own conditions , from how much alcohol was drunk to how stable a couple 's relationship was and how long they had been trying to conceive naturally .
those who want to see the government make pcts offer three full cycles argue that restrictions are ultimately a false economy for the nhs .
the average cost of a pregnancy involving triplets for instance , is £ 32,350 - about 10 times more than one involving a single infant .
care for children with long-term disabilities as a result of premature birth can also prove a serious financial burden .
if couples felt they had the chance to try again when a first effort fails , the logic goes , they would be less likely to opt for multiple embryo transfers .
at the same time , techniques are being developed which appear to improve the chances of pregnancy in certain women when only one embryo is used .
there is much to learn for instance from countries like belgium and sweden , which only allow single embryo transfer but have high pregnancy rates .
but as well as action from government on the three cycles , fertility doctors want society as a whole to stop thinking of ivf as a luxury - even for an nhs which refuses to pay for some life-lengthening cancer drugs .
" some people never get over the inability to have a child - it has a huge impact on their health and wellbeing , it can end up in the break up of their marriage , " says dr yakoub khalaf , a consultant at the assisted conception unit at guy 's and saint thomas 's hospital in london .
" it has to be seen as a disease , and one for which we have a cure . "

not so , doctors warn there was a point last year when , for the first time ever , every neo-natal care bed in the country was taken .
doctors have put this down in part to the growing number of babies born as a result of ivf .
this can produce many multiple births - infants who are often premature and sickly , and therefore in need of intensive and expensive specialist care .
the foremost fertility minds are currently at work to try to find ways to reduce the number of twins and triplets born as a result of these procedures , which often involve the implantation of as many as three embryos .
for many women , this may well maximise the chance of a successful pregnancy , but at a price .
" one of the real obstacles is persuading parents that twins are not ' two for the price of one " ' , says dr gillian lockwood , medical director of midland fertility services .
" i see these babies all the time - tiny things who often have real problems - but parents do n't always understand the risks - or if they do , are prepared to take them if it means they end up with a baby . "
last chance saloon a quarter of ivf babies are twins or triplets : multiple births are nearly 20 times higher as a result of assisted conception that when it happens spontaneously .
ivf in the uk 30,000 treated every year 25 % of births multiple less than 5 % of pcts offer three cycles private treatment costs up to £ 6,000 however they are conceived , those who share a womb with siblings are far more likely to be born prematurely - and this brings with it a series of risks .
twins are seven times more likely to die in the first few weeks of life than their singleton counterparts , and are six times more likely to develop cerebral palsy .
but for many infertile couples these are chances worth taking .
" it 's true that for some couples twins are seen as highly desirable , double the joy , and many simply have n't had the risks properly explained , " says susan seenan of infertility network uk .
" but it 's a very complicated picture .

the local government committee urged ministers to give all english councils powers to introduce their own schemes - as originally announced in may 2007 .
it said the new proposals were a " messy compromise " following hostile media coverage and would not show if such " pay-as-you-throw " schemes worked .
ministers , who want to cut landfill waste , said pilots were a useful test .
the uk has to reduce waste going into landfill by nearly two-thirds by 2020 to meet eu targets .
we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them joan ruddock minister for climate change send us your comments the minister for climate change , joan ruddock , defended the schemes .
" i think the committee has really been quite pessimistic about this and we think that these pilots will work .
" we think that there are local authorities who will want to do the schemes and that they will be effective in getting our recycling rates even further up than they are already .
" we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them by saying we will start with pilots . "
scheme restricted in the climate change bill there are proposals for five areas to pilot a scheme aimed at getting more people to recycle waste .
householders who recycle the most would get a financial reward , those who recycle the least would face a fine .
week by week , his -lsb- gordon brown 's -rsb- plans for bin taxes , like so many other policies , suffer a new blow to their credibility eric pickles , shadow local government secretary in may 2007 the government said all 354 local authorities in england would be allowed to introduce the scheme - but in november this was restricted to five pilot areas .
an england-wide rollout was put back until 2012-13 .
under the current proposals , councils would not be able to raise any money from the schemes themselves - all money raised would be redistributed in rewards .
' over-optimistic ' in its report , the communities and local government select committee said , as there were already schemes operating across europe , " a mere " five pilot schemes would add little to the understanding of whether it would work in england .
it said it was hard to see why any council would volunteer to " set up a complicated charging scheme that earns it no money and risks widespread public disapproval " .
the committee 's labour chairman , phyllis starkey , said the government had " in the face of highly negative media coverage , mounted a wholehearted retreat from even the limited policy outlined last may " .
the committee also said the government was being " over optimistic about the impact charging will have on householders " who believe they already pay for rubbish collection through council tax .
one size does n't fit all .
one solution is n't ideal for every council in the country paul bettison local government association and it said the government 's plans to cap the highest penalties or rewards councils could offer " runs counter to the government 's rhetoric on devolution " .
instead councils should be given the option to introduce their own schemes and decide what rewards or fines , if any , should be levied .
they also pointed out that ms ruddock had told the committee the charges were " definitively not a tax " , then said they were considered " a form of tax " by the treasury .
the apparent confusion was " a matter of considerable concern " , mps said .
ms starkey said she thought the government had backed down because of the " very virulent press campaigns that there have been criticising changes in the way waste disposal is collected " .
' stop dithering ' shadow local government secretary eric pickles said the report showed prime minister gordon brown " has become the living embodiment of the law of diminishing returns " .
" week by week , his plans for bin taxes , like so many other policies , suffer a new blow to their credibility , " mr pickles said .
" he should now stop his dithering and have the courage to scrap these flawed and unpopular new taxes completely . "
and liberal democrat communities and local government spokesman julia goldsworthy said : " these pilot schemes have been wrapped up in so much red tape and complexity that their chance of success was impossibly slim .
" the government may as well have condemned the proposals to the rubbish bin . "
but paul bettison , who chairs the local government association 's environment board , said it was right to let councils choose whether they introduced the charge .
" a lot of councils feel they do n't need this particular scheme , this particular power , if you like , and that their residents are doing a pretty good job of recycling already , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" one size does n't fit all .

the local government committee urged ministers to give all english councils powers to introduce their own schemes - as originally announced in may 2007 .
it said the new proposals were a " messy compromise " following hostile media coverage and would not show if such " pay-as-you-throw " schemes worked .
ministers , who want to cut landfill waste , said pilots were a useful test .
the uk has to reduce waste going into landfill by nearly two-thirds by 2020 to meet eu targets .
we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them joan ruddock minister for climate change send us your comments the minister for climate change , joan ruddock , defended the schemes .
" i think the committee has really been quite pessimistic about this and we think that these pilots will work .

" we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them by saying we will start with pilots . "
scheme restricted in the climate change bill there are proposals for five areas to pilot a scheme aimed at getting more people to recycle waste .
householders who recycle the most would get a financial reward , those who recycle the least would face a fine .

an england-wide rollout was put back until 2012-13 .
under the current proposals , councils would not be able to raise any money from the schemes themselves - all money raised would be redistributed in rewards .
' over-optimistic ' in its report , the communities and local government select committee said , as there were already schemes operating across europe , " a mere " five pilot schemes would add little to the understanding of whether it would work in england .
it said it was hard to see why any council would volunteer to " set up a complicated charging scheme that earns it no money and risks widespread public disapproval " .
the committee 's labour chairman , phyllis starkey , said the government had " in the face of highly negative media coverage , mounted a wholehearted retreat from even the limited policy outlined last may " .
the committee also said the government was being " over optimistic about the impact charging will have on householders " who believe they already pay for rubbish collection through council tax .

week by week , his -lsb- gordon brown 's -rsb- plans for bin taxes , like so many other policies , suffer a new blow to their credibility eric pickles , shadow local government secretary in may 2007 the government said all 354 local authorities in england would be allowed to introduce the scheme - but in november this was restricted to five pilot areas .
an england-wide rollout was put back until 2012-13 .
under the current proposals , councils would not be able to raise any money from the schemes themselves - all money raised would be redistributed in rewards .
' over-optimistic ' in its report , the communities and local government select committee said , as there were already schemes operating across europe , " a mere " five pilot schemes would add little to the understanding of whether it would work in england .
it said it was hard to see why any council would volunteer to " set up a complicated charging scheme that earns it no money and risks widespread public disapproval " .
the committee 's labour chairman , phyllis starkey , said the government had " in the face of highly negative media coverage , mounted a wholehearted retreat from even the limited policy outlined last may " .
the committee also said the government was being " over optimistic about the impact charging will have on householders " who believe they already pay for rubbish collection through council tax .

one solution is n't ideal for every council in the country paul bettison local government association and it said the government 's plans to cap the highest penalties or rewards councils could offer " runs counter to the government 's rhetoric on devolution " .
instead councils should be given the option to introduce their own schemes and decide what rewards or fines , if any , should be levied .
they also pointed out that ms ruddock had told the committee the charges were " definitively not a tax " , then said they were considered " a form of tax " by the treasury .
the apparent confusion was " a matter of considerable concern " , mps said .
ms starkey said she thought the government had backed down because of the " very virulent press campaigns that there have been criticising changes in the way waste disposal is collected " .
' stop dithering ' shadow local government secretary eric pickles said the report showed prime minister gordon brown " has become the living embodiment of the law of diminishing returns " .
" week by week , his plans for bin taxes , like so many other policies , suffer a new blow to their credibility , " mr pickles said .
" he should now stop his dithering and have the courage to scrap these flawed and unpopular new taxes completely . "
and liberal democrat communities and local government spokesman julia goldsworthy said : " these pilot schemes have been wrapped up in so much red tape and complexity that their chance of success was impossibly slim .
" the government may as well have condemned the proposals to the rubbish bin . "
but paul bettison , who chairs the local government association 's environment board , said it was right to let councils choose whether they introduced the charge .
" a lot of councils feel they do n't need this particular scheme , this particular power , if you like , and that their residents are doing a pretty good job of recycling already , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .

the local government committee urged ministers to give all english councils powers to introduce their own schemes - as originally announced in may 2007 .
it said the new proposals were a " messy compromise " following hostile media coverage and would not show if such " pay-as-you-throw " schemes worked .
ministers , who want to cut landfill waste , said pilots were a useful test .
the uk has to reduce waste going into landfill by nearly two-thirds by 2020 to meet eu targets . "
we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them " joan ruddock minister for climate change send us your comments the minister for climate change , joan ruddock , defended the schemes .
" i think the committee has really been quite pessimistic about this and we think that these pilots will work .
" we think that there are local authorities who will want to do the schemes and that they will be effective in getting our recycling rates even further up than they are already .
" we do n't apologise in any way for listening to the opinions that have been put to us and responding to them by saying we will start with pilots . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- viewpoint : the eu 's toughest operation british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service languages russian albanian serbian turkish ukrainian more page last updated at 09:12 gmt , thursday , 21 february 2008 e-mail this to a friend printable version viewpoint : the eu 's toughest operation there will be 1,900 european specialists and 1,000 local staff the russians have branded the eu 's police and justice mission to kosovo illegal but roy reeve , the british diplomat who has been planning it , insists he has not encountered substantial opposition on the ground .
he tells the bbc news website of his hopes for the mission .
we 're not the un , not just a different-coloured beret on the tour .
our current planning is that we will have specialist police officers sitting in the same police stations working directly alongside kosovo police counterparts , whether serbian or albanian , so we will be in all parts of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large - we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities our judges will sit on the district courts alongside their kosovo partners , again they can be either serbian or albanian depending where it is , and we will also be working in the prosecutors ' offices as well .
we are not going to have separate fortresses scattered around the countryside from which we will sally forth occasionally to do good deeds .
the aim of this mission is to work alongside our opposite numbers and increase their capabilities , while we will retain some executive authority and powers , if there are cases which may be too difficult for the local authorities to tackle .
sensitive areas there are some sensitive areas such as organised crime , corruption , trafficking .
there is also an element of some war crimes cases which are still left over , which we will need to start working on .
this has been something the un has not really focused on perhaps as much as they should have , but these are things we will pick up .
they may be difficult for the newly established institutions to handle in the early days , so we will take those on .
we are seeing a lot of incidents and activities on the ground in the serb enclaves .
whether they will still be going on when we get here i do not know .
but we will have a major public outreach programme over the next two or three months , saying to them : " look , this is in your interests .
if we can work with the people here to deliver a better police service , a better judicial system than exists at the moment , then you should see the value of that , you should begin to work with us . "
we have been obviously talking to them over the course of the last year or so , explaining what it is were trying to do , but at the moment the political temperature is high .
there are serbian members of the kosovo police service , so there is some commitment to the rule of law on the ground .
the mandate of our mission is kosovo-wide .
it would be silly for me to start predicting exact moves or how we are going to handle it .
but our intent is clear , that we will operate throughout the entire territory .
government in place the legal view - and this is what all member states based their judgement on when they agreed to the launch of this mission - is that the continuation of -lrb- un security council resolution -rrb- 1244 , the invitation we have received from the newly constituted government of kosovo is sufficient for us to operate , because the situation has changed .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground we do now have a government in place which has been recognised by some countries and may be recognised by others as we go forward .
all of the eu member countries agreed , at midnight last friday to be precise , to launch the mission .
that agreement is there and that gives us what we need .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground .
we are going to be putting on the ground some 1,900 international specialists , together with their local team of over 1,000 people .
but since the planning team has been on the ground since may 2006 and we are over 100-strong , we think we have got everything in place .
over the course of the last 18 months or so , there have been regular visits to belgrade to explain what we are going to do .
it is not going to be a big-bang entry .
we are going to have to work with what we find on the ground and there is going to be a period of transition , three to four months , between the un finally handing over to us and us becoming fully operational .
no takeover the original mandate for this operation is two years .
we are coming in with an exit strategy already in mind .
in some of the specialised police areas - investigations , forensic science - we can probably achieve european levels fairly rapidly so we can start to scale that down .
in other areas , perhaps working with the judiciary , it might take longer .
this is not a european takeover or a european protectorate with regard to what we are trying to do here and we are not just simply replacing the un with yet another international organisation .
we are not replacing the un as the executive proconsuls of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large .
we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities .

he tells the bbc news website of his hopes for the mission .
we 're not the un , not just a different-coloured beret on the tour .
our current planning is that we will have specialist police officers sitting in the same police stations working directly alongside kosovo police counterparts , whether serbian or albanian , so we will be in all parts of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large - we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities our judges will sit on the district courts alongside their kosovo partners , again they can be either serbian or albanian depending where it is , and we will also be working in the prosecutors ' offices as well .
we are not going to have separate fortresses scattered around the countryside from which we will sally forth occasionally to do good deeds .
the aim of this mission is to work alongside our opposite numbers and increase their capabilities , while we will retain some executive authority and powers , if there are cases which may be too difficult for the local authorities to tackle .
sensitive areas there are some sensitive areas such as organised crime , corruption , trafficking .
there is also an element of some war crimes cases which are still left over , which we will need to start working on .
this has been something the un has not really focused on perhaps as much as they should have , but these are things we will pick up .
they may be difficult for the newly established institutions to handle in the early days , so we will take those on .
we are seeing a lot of incidents and activities on the ground in the serb enclaves .
whether they will still be going on when we get here i do not know .
but we will have a major public outreach programme over the next two or three months , saying to them : " look , this is in your interests .
if we can work with the people here to deliver a better police service , a better judicial system than exists at the moment , then you should see the value of that , you should begin to work with us . "
we have been obviously talking to them over the course of the last year or so , explaining what it is were trying to do , but at the moment the political temperature is high .
there are serbian members of the kosovo police service , so there is some commitment to the rule of law on the ground .
the mandate of our mission is kosovo-wide .
it would be silly for me to start predicting exact moves or how we are going to handle it .
but our intent is clear , that we will operate throughout the entire territory .
government in place the legal view - and this is what all member states based their judgement on when they agreed to the launch of this mission - is that the continuation of -lrb- un security council resolution -rrb- 1244 , the invitation we have received from the newly constituted government of kosovo is sufficient for us to operate , because the situation has changed .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground we do now have a government in place which has been recognised by some countries and may be recognised by others as we go forward .
all of the eu member countries agreed , at midnight last friday to be precise , to launch the mission .
that agreement is there and that gives us what we need .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground .
we are going to be putting on the ground some 1,900 international specialists , together with their local team of over 1,000 people .
but since the planning team has been on the ground since may 2006 and we are over 100-strong , we think we have got everything in place .
over the course of the last 18 months or so , there have been regular visits to belgrade to explain what we are going to do .
it is not going to be a big-bang entry .
we are going to have to work with what we find on the ground and there is going to be a period of transition , three to four months , between the un finally handing over to us and us becoming fully operational .
no takeover the original mandate for this operation is two years .
we are coming in with an exit strategy already in mind .
in some of the specialised police areas - investigations , forensic science - we can probably achieve european levels fairly rapidly so we can start to scale that down .
in other areas , perhaps working with the judiciary , it might take longer .
this is not a european takeover or a european protectorate with regard to what we are trying to do here and we are not just simply replacing the un with yet another international organisation .
we are not replacing the un as the executive proconsuls of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large .
we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities .

he tells the bbc news website of his hopes for the mission .
we 're not the un , not just a different-coloured beret on the tour .
our current planning is that we will have specialist police officers sitting in the same police stations working directly alongside kosovo police counterparts , whether serbian or albanian , so we will be in all parts of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large - we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities our judges will sit on the district courts alongside their kosovo partners , again they can be either serbian or albanian depending where it is , and we will also be working in the prosecutors ' offices as well .
we are not going to have separate fortresses scattered around the countryside from which we will sally forth occasionally to do good deeds .
the aim of this mission is to work alongside our opposite numbers and increase their capabilities , while we will retain some executive authority and powers , if there are cases which may be too difficult for the local authorities to tackle .
sensitive areas there are some sensitive areas such as organised crime , corruption , trafficking .
there is also an element of some war crimes cases which are still left over , which we will need to start working on .
this has been something the un has not really focused on perhaps as much as they should have , but these are things we will pick up .
they may be difficult for the newly established institutions to handle in the early days , so we will take those on .
we are seeing a lot of incidents and activities on the ground in the serb enclaves .
whether they will still be going on when we get here i do not know .
but we will have a major public outreach programme over the next two or three months , saying to them : " look , this is in your interests .
if we can work with the people here to deliver a better police service , a better judicial system than exists at the moment , then you should see the value of that , you should begin to work with us . "
we have been obviously talking to them over the course of the last year or so , explaining what it is were trying to do , but at the moment the political temperature is high .
there are serbian members of the kosovo police service , so there is some commitment to the rule of law on the ground .
the mandate of our mission is kosovo-wide .
it would be silly for me to start predicting exact moves or how we are going to handle it .
but our intent is clear , that we will operate throughout the entire territory .
government in place the legal view - and this is what all member states based their judgement on when they agreed to the launch of this mission - is that the continuation of -lrb- un security council resolution -rrb- 1244 , the invitation we have received from the newly constituted government of kosovo is sufficient for us to operate , because the situation has changed .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground we do now have a government in place which has been recognised by some countries and may be recognised by others as we go forward .
all of the eu member countries agreed , at midnight last friday to be precise , to launch the mission .
that agreement is there and that gives us what we need .
it is going to be the biggest field operation that the eu has ever put on the ground .
we are going to be putting on the ground some 1,900 international specialists , together with their local team of over 1,000 people .
but since the planning team has been on the ground since may 2006 and we are over 100-strong , we think we have got everything in place .
over the course of the last 18 months or so , there have been regular visits to belgrade to explain what we are going to do .
it is not going to be a big-bang entry .
we are going to have to work with what we find on the ground and there is going to be a period of transition , three to four months , between the un finally handing over to us and us becoming fully operational .
no takeover the original mandate for this operation is two years .
we are coming in with an exit strategy already in mind .
in some of the specialised police areas - investigations , forensic science - we can probably achieve european levels fairly rapidly so we can start to scale that down .
in other areas , perhaps working with the judiciary , it might take longer .
this is not a european takeover or a european protectorate with regard to what we are trying to do here and we are not just simply replacing the un with yet another international organisation .
we are not replacing the un as the executive proconsuls of kosovo .
the whole aim is to make ourselves very open to the population at large .
we are not hiding behind international privileges and immunities .
