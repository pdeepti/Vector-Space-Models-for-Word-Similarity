he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene . " these elections revolutionize the national political geography , marking a decisive step forward by italy " towards political streamlining and institutional modernization , massimo giannini of rome university told the afp news agency . back in office after two years in opposition , 71-year-old berlusconi will return to the prime minister 's office for the third time since he swept onto the political stage with forza italia .
he served as premier for seven months from april 1994 and from 2001-2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was just over 80 percent - some 3.5 percent less than in 2006 polls with his strong mandate , berlusconi may be successful in pushing reforms through parliament .
however , many italians have lost faith in politics and are skeptical that any government will be able to quickly cure the problems the european union 's fourth-largest economy faces . " the months and years ahead will be difficult and i am preparing a government ready to last five years , " berlusconi said monday night . big pledges , past corruption allegations berlusconi has pledged to cut taxes , reduce public debt , liberalize the economy and crack down on crime .
critics have pointed out that he failed to fulfill pledges to revolutionize italy when he was in office previously . the prime minister-elect , who is known as il cavaliere -lrb- the knight -rrb- , has also said one-third of his cabinet would be women and promised to improve the employment chances for discouraged youths .
he said he would resolve a long-standing garbage dispute in naples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media magnate has been implicated in corruption probes berlusconi held a double-digit lead over veltroni when campaigning began in february , but that dropped to 6 percent to 7 percent when final pre-election polls were conducted two weeks ago . berlusconi has been implicated in numerous corruption probes and tallied a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product during his last stint as prime minister . he said he wanted franco frattini - currently head of justice and security policy at the european commission - as his foreign minister and would like to see gianfranco fini , his last foreign minister , preside over the lower house of parliament . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene . " these elections revolutionize the national political geography , marking a decisive step forward by italy " towards political streamlining and institutional modernization , massimo giannini of rome university told the afp news agency . back in office after two years in opposition , 71-year-old berlusconi will return to the prime minister 's office for the third time since he swept onto the political stage with forza italia .
he served as premier for seven months from april 1994 and from 2001-2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was just over 80 percent - some 3.5 percent less than in 2006 polls with his strong mandate , berlusconi may be successful in pushing reforms through parliament .
however , many italians have lost faith in politics and are skeptical that any government will be able to quickly cure the problems the european union 's fourth-largest economy faces . " the months and years ahead will be difficult and i am preparing a government ready to last five years , " berlusconi said monday night . big pledges , past corruption allegations berlusconi has pledged to cut taxes , reduce public debt , liberalize the economy and crack down on crime .
critics have pointed out that he failed to fulfill pledges to revolutionize italy when he was in office previously . the prime minister-elect , who is known as il cavaliere -lrb- the knight -rrb- , has also said one-third of his cabinet would be women and promised to improve the employment chances for discouraged youths .
he said he would resolve a long-standing garbage dispute in naples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media magnate has been implicated in corruption probes berlusconi held a double-digit lead over veltroni when campaigning began in february , but that dropped to 6 percent to 7 percent when final pre-election polls were conducted two weeks ago . berlusconi has been implicated in numerous corruption probes and tallied a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product during his last stint as prime minister . he said he wanted franco frattini - currently head of justice and security policy at the european commission - as his foreign minister and would like to see gianfranco fini , his last foreign minister , preside over the lower house of parliament . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.04.2008 italy 's berlusconi lands sweeping victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has had over 60 governments since world war ii ; berlusconi will head the newest silvio berlusconi won italy 's general elections by an unexpectedly wide margin , claiming the prime minister 's office for the third time .
he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene . " these elections revolutionize the national political geography , marking a decisive step forward by italy " towards political streamlining and institutional modernization , massimo giannini of rome university told the afp news agency . back in office after two years in opposition , 71-year-old berlusconi will return to the prime minister 's office for the third time since he swept onto the political stage with forza italia .
he served as premier for seven months from april 1994 and from 2001-2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was just over 80 percent - some 3.5 percent less than in 2006 polls with his strong mandate , berlusconi may be successful in pushing reforms through parliament .
however , many italians have lost faith in politics and are skeptical that any government will be able to quickly cure the problems the european union 's fourth-largest economy faces . " the months and years ahead will be difficult and i am preparing a government ready to last five years , " berlusconi said monday night . big pledges , past corruption allegations berlusconi has pledged to cut taxes , reduce public debt , liberalize the economy and crack down on crime .
critics have pointed out that he failed to fulfill pledges to revolutionize italy when he was in office previously . the prime minister-elect , who is known as il cavaliere -lrb- the knight -rrb- , has also said one-third of his cabinet would be women and promised to improve the employment chances for discouraged youths .
he said he would resolve a long-standing garbage dispute in naples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media magnate has been implicated in corruption probes berlusconi held a double-digit lead over veltroni when campaigning began in february , but that dropped to 6 percent to 7 percent when final pre-election polls were conducted two weeks ago . berlusconi has been implicated in numerous corruption probes and tallied a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product during his last stint as prime minister . he said he wanted franco frattini - currently head of justice and security policy at the european commission - as his foreign minister and would like to see gianfranco fini , his last foreign minister , preside over the lower house of parliament . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i want to send a signal by not taking part in the opening ceremony , " 27-year-old yvonne boenisch told german public broadcaster zdf on tuesday , april 15 . but boenisch , the first german woman to win a judo gold medal - at the olympics in athens in 2004 - ruled out that she would be boycotting the olympics games altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests along the olympics torch relay in london " participating in the olympics is every athlete 's biggest wish , " she said .
" a boycott now would shatter thousands of athletes ' dreams . " instead , during the games , boenisch plans to wear a wristband symbolizing her distain of china 's crackdown in tibet . other athletes headed to the olympics will likely be less vocal .

" us athletes may be quieter numerous us athletes announced on monday that they would refrain from making political statements at the games , saying they would concentrate on winning medals . " we hope we are able to bring awareness to peace and team unity .
that 's our main objective .
winning the gold medal is where we can speak the loudest , by representing our country in the best way possible , " said 2004 us women 's soccer olympian heather o 'reilly . " we hope to bring the world together .
but that 's a lot to ask of an athlete , not only to go over and win a gold medal but also have these political views .

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .
at its worst , 450,000 people lived in the warsaw ghetto . before world war ii , 3.5 million jews lived in poland , 400,000 in warsaw alone .
half of the six million jews killed in the holocaust were polish . in deference to religious jews , the official commemorative ceremonies were held on tuesday , since the anniversary falls on the jewish sabbath . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in what concerns the leadership of the party , for the head of government it is a natural , successful and civilized practice in all democratic states ... and that is why i gratefully thank the party for their proposal and agree to take the head of the united russia party , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party united russia is seen as an appendage of the presidential administration , uniting almost all russia 's regional governors and top politicians under one banner .
during putin 's eight years in the kremlin , he has steadily centralized power , with united russia seen as his tool for ensuring the loyalty of an emasculated parliament . as its ruler and the country 's most popular politician , putin , 55 , is set to become russia 's most powerful prime minister ever , undercutting the presidency three weeks before he hands over the 42-year-old medvedev . reorganization some united russia members tuesday hailed putin 's leadership as a " radical " reorganization in the balance of power toward a parliamentary republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and medvevev , all smiles " analysts and those in the media are still trying to figure out who portrait will end up hanging in government offices across the country , " commentator konstatin sonin wrote in tuesday 's moscow times newspaper . some analysts said putin consolidates power in the party as an alternative to the so-called " power vertical " or putin 's steady centralization of resources in the presidency in his eight-year rule . but others discounted rumours of change , calling the party a weak and loose " club of bureaucrats and businessmen . " " putin will take a ceremonial , high-ranking post immune to criticism and without a great burden of responsibility which can offer him independence and security , " the head of the national strategy institute , stanislav belkovsky , told the dpa news agency . soviet-era throwback in a scene reminiscent of soviet-era mass party conventions , some 600 delegates tuesday held up a sea of white cards first to vote for an amendment to the charter creating the new post tailored to putin , and then to unanimously elect him to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united russia party conference the party presented a glitzy photographic album of tributes to putin by figures ranging from mikhail gorbachev to soviet writer and former dissident alexander solzhenitsyn . " putin inherited a country looted and knocked to its knees , with the majority of the population demoralized and impoverished .
and he started , little by little , gradually , its rebuilding , " solzhenitsyn was quoted as saying . putin , whose popularity earned the party its 315 out of 450-seat rule in russia 's duma , said he would work to ensure it acts " as a single organism in the interest of the russian people . " the two-day party rally was adjourned immediately after medvedev and putin delivered their quick one-two , entering and exiting the hall walking side-by-side in classic style .
the two have promised to rule in tandem and there are no visible signs of conflict . russia 's president has the power to appoint and fire the prime minister , but he must win parliament 's approval , whose majority party putin will now head . chairman , but not member putin becomes party chairman without officially joining united russia , which many see as a corrupt group of functionaries . with this symbolic distance putin encourages the czarist-like appellation of national leader heard from party delegates . he also rejects being part of mundane of party politics and throws off comparisons to the general secretary of communist party of the soviet union -lrb- cpsu -rrb- . putin " is preserving his independence .
he strengthens his role as national leader , " kremlin-linked analyst sergei markov said on the sidelines of the conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.04.2008 italy 's berlusconi lands sweeping victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has had over 60 governments since world war ii ; berlusconi will head the newest silvio berlusconi won italy 's general elections by an unexpectedly wide margin , claiming the prime minister 's office for the third time .
he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene .

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .
at its worst , 450,000 people lived in the warsaw ghetto . before world war ii , 3.5 million jews lived in poland , 400,000 in warsaw alone .
half of the six million jews killed in the holocaust were polish . in deference to religious jews , the official commemorative ceremonies were held on tuesday , since the anniversary falls on the jewish sabbath . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .

eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .

in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .
at its worst , 450,000 people lived in the warsaw ghetto . before world war ii , 3.5 million jews lived in poland , 400,000 in warsaw alone .

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? merkel 's office has been flooded with questions about the more-than-usual amount of chancellor cleavage on display in the norwegian capital .
at the weekend inauguration of the oslo opera house , merkel wore a très décolleté black dress with a blue bolero . the dress stole some of the limelight from crown princesses victoria of sweden and mette-marit of norway , who generally outshine merkel in the glamour category by a substantial margin . " guests were asked to wear evening dress , " government spokesman thomas steg told a government briefing .
" that this dress caused such a furor seemed excessive to the chancellor . " he said that merkel was sorry if she had diverted attention away from the royals , adding that the chancellor was shocked about the extent of the coverage , although she was not really upset about it , since most of the reports were complimentary . " but if the world has nothing more important to do than to talk about or report on evening dresses , what can one do ? " he said . merkel is certainly used to less flattering coverage of her appearance .
in the 1990s , her pageboy haircut and sensible shoes made her the butt of jokes .
in 2006 , the british tabloid the sun published photographs of merkel changing into her bathing suit , her rear end partially exposed . while merkel 's style has softened as chancellor , the 53-year-old is not considered a fashion trailblazer with the black trousers and boxy jackets she has almost made her uniform . so some commentators wondered if the dress signalled a general change in style .
but the newspaper die welt quoted the chancellor 's dressmaker , anna von griesheim , as describing merkel 's dress style as " power suit in the day , princess at night .

is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? merkel 's office has been flooded with questions about the more-than-usual amount of chancellor cleavage on display in the norwegian capital .
at the weekend inauguration of the oslo opera house , merkel wore a très décolleté black dress with a blue bolero . the dress stole some of the limelight from crown princesses victoria of sweden and mette-marit of norway , who generally outshine merkel in the glamour category by a substantial margin . " guests were asked to wear evening dress , " government spokesman thomas steg told a government briefing .
" that this dress caused such a furor seemed excessive to the chancellor . " he said that merkel was sorry if she had diverted attention away from the royals , adding that the chancellor was shocked about the extent of the coverage , although she was not really upset about it , since most of the reports were complimentary . " but if the world has nothing more important to do than to talk about or report on evening dresses , what can one do ? " he said . merkel is certainly used to less flattering coverage of her appearance .
in the 1990s , her pageboy haircut and sensible shoes made her the butt of jokes .
in 2006 , the british tabloid the sun published photographs of merkel changing into her bathing suit , her rear end partially exposed . while merkel 's style has softened as chancellor , the 53-year-old is not considered a fashion trailblazer with the black trousers and boxy jackets she has almost made her uniform . so some commentators wondered if the dress signalled a general change in style .
but the newspaper die welt quoted the chancellor 's dressmaker , anna von griesheim , as describing merkel 's dress style as " power suit in the day , princess at night .

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

" in what concerns the leadership of the party , for the head of government it is a natural , successful and civilized practice in all democratic states ... and that is why i gratefully thank the party for their proposal and agree to take the head of the united russia party , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party united russia is seen as an appendage of the presidential administration , uniting almost all russia 's regional governors and top politicians under one banner .
during putin 's eight years in the kremlin , he has steadily centralized power , with united russia seen as his tool for ensuring the loyalty of an emasculated parliament . as its ruler and the country 's most popular politician , putin , 55 , is set to become russia 's most powerful prime minister ever , undercutting the presidency three weeks before he hands over the 42-year-old medvedev . reorganization some united russia members tuesday hailed putin 's leadership as a " radical " reorganization in the balance of power toward a parliamentary republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and medvevev , all smiles " analysts and those in the media are still trying to figure out who portrait will end up hanging in government offices across the country , " commentator konstatin sonin wrote in tuesday 's moscow times newspaper . some analysts said putin consolidates power in the party as an alternative to the so-called " power vertical " or putin 's steady centralization of resources in the presidency in his eight-year rule . but others discounted rumours of change , calling the party a weak and loose " club of bureaucrats and businessmen . " " putin will take a ceremonial , high-ranking post immune to criticism and without a great burden of responsibility which can offer him independence and security , " the head of the national strategy institute , stanislav belkovsky , told the dpa news agency . soviet-era throwback in a scene reminiscent of soviet-era mass party conventions , some 600 delegates tuesday held up a sea of white cards first to vote for an amendment to the charter creating the new post tailored to putin , and then to unanimously elect him to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united russia party conference the party presented a glitzy photographic album of tributes to putin by figures ranging from mikhail gorbachev to soviet writer and former dissident alexander solzhenitsyn . " putin inherited a country looted and knocked to its knees , with the majority of the population demoralized and impoverished .
and he started , little by little , gradually , its rebuilding , " solzhenitsyn was quoted as saying . putin , whose popularity earned the party its 315 out of 450-seat rule in russia 's duma , said he would work to ensure it acts " as a single organism in the interest of the russian people . " the two-day party rally was adjourned immediately after medvedev and putin delivered their quick one-two , entering and exiting the hall walking side-by-side in classic style .
the two have promised to rule in tandem and there are no visible signs of conflict . russia 's president has the power to appoint and fire the prime minister , but he must win parliament 's approval , whose majority party putin will now head . chairman , but not member putin becomes party chairman without officially joining united russia , which many see as a corrupt group of functionaries . with this symbolic distance putin encourages the czarist-like appellation of national leader heard from party delegates . he also rejects being part of mundane of party politics and throws off comparisons to the general secretary of communist party of the soviet union -lrb- cpsu -rrb- . putin " is preserving his independence .
he strengthens his role as national leader , " kremlin-linked analyst sergei markov said on the sidelines of the conference .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene . " these elections revolutionize the national political geography , marking a decisive step forward by italy " towards political streamlining and institutional modernization , massimo giannini of rome university told the afp news agency . back in office after two years in opposition , 71-year-old berlusconi will return to the prime minister 's office for the third time since he swept onto the political stage with forza italia .
he served as premier for seven months from april 1994 and from 2001-2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was just over 80 percent - some 3.5 percent less than in 2006 polls with his strong mandate , berlusconi may be successful in pushing reforms through parliament .
however , many italians have lost faith in politics and are skeptical that any government will be able to quickly cure the problems the european union 's fourth-largest economy faces . " the months and years ahead will be difficult and i am preparing a government ready to last five years , " berlusconi said monday night . big pledges , past corruption allegations berlusconi has pledged to cut taxes , reduce public debt , liberalize the economy and crack down on crime .
critics have pointed out that he failed to fulfill pledges to revolutionize italy when he was in office previously . the prime minister-elect , who is known as il cavaliere -lrb- the knight -rrb- , has also said one-third of his cabinet would be women and promised to improve the employment chances for discouraged youths .

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .

" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.04.2008 church influences europeans but has little political impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american cardinals may have a difficult time deciding who to support in the us election some wonder if the pope 's trip to the us is aimed at increasing the church 's political influence in the elections .
in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned that hurdles remain for the country suffering from an economic downturn . italy shifted back to the right as berlusconi won a third stint at prime minister , and five parties - including two major voting blocs - were voted into the country 's parliament .
berlusconi said tuesday , april 15 , that he would form his government within a week . " i will govern for five years , " berlusconi told public television after his center-left rival walter veltroni conceded defeat . " we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " the conservative billionaire said , offering " an affectionate kiss to all italians . " following berlusconi 's clear victory , veltroni , rome 's former mayor , said : " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-left leader veltroni conceded defeat with ballot-counting nearly finished , results saw berlusconi 's voting bloc , the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- , with an advantage of 41 seats in the senate , the upper house of parliament , which has 315 elected and seven life-time senators . the last government under romano prodi - who resigned in january , just months into his five-year term - had just a two-seat senate majority .
the upper house contributed to prodi 's downfall , when a small party with just three senators withdrew its support for the center-left coalition . smaller parties lose out the pdl , which formed last year , absorbed berlusconi 's forza italia and the conservative national alliance and ran in a coalition with the anti-immigration northern league of umberto bossi . the left suffered big losses in the election .
veltroni 's new bloc , the democratic party , excluded the rainbow left - which is composed of communists and greens .
the rainbow coalition lost badly , tallying only around 3.5 percent of the senate vote , compared with 11.5 percent in 2006 . other smaller parties also polled poorly as over 80 percent of voters supported berlusconi or veltroni 's blocs .
christian democratic leader pier ferdinando casini said parliament may have only five parties this time around , compared with some 20 last time - a major turnaround for italy 's normally fragmented political scene . " these elections revolutionize the national political geography , marking a decisive step forward by italy " towards political streamlining and institutional modernization , massimo giannini of rome university told the afp news agency . back in office after two years in opposition , 71-year-old berlusconi will return to the prime minister 's office for the third time since he swept onto the political stage with forza italia .
he served as premier for seven months from april 1994 and from 2001-2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was just over 80 percent - some 3.5 percent less than in 2006 polls with his strong mandate , berlusconi may be successful in pushing reforms through parliament .
however , many italians have lost faith in politics and are skeptical that any government will be able to quickly cure the problems the european union 's fourth-largest economy faces . " the months and years ahead will be difficult and i am preparing a government ready to last five years , " berlusconi said monday night . big pledges , past corruption allegations berlusconi has pledged to cut taxes , reduce public debt , liberalize the economy and crack down on crime .
critics have pointed out that he failed to fulfill pledges to revolutionize italy when he was in office previously . the prime minister-elect , who is known as il cavaliere -lrb- the knight -rrb- , has also said one-third of his cabinet would be women and promised to improve the employment chances for discouraged youths .
he said he would resolve a long-standing garbage dispute in naples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media magnate has been implicated in corruption probes berlusconi held a double-digit lead over veltroni when campaigning began in february , but that dropped to 6 percent to 7 percent when final pre-election polls were conducted two weeks ago . berlusconi has been implicated in numerous corruption probes and tallied a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product during his last stint as prime minister . he said he wanted franco frattini - currently head of justice and security policy at the european commission - as his foreign minister and would like to see gianfranco fini , his last foreign minister , preside over the lower house of parliament . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ullrich still insists that he 's innocent . the bonn prosecutor 's office said the payment , described only as a six-figure sum , will mean the retired cyclist , who now lives in switzerland , will not have to face criminal charges .
the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

the deal ends nearly two years of investigation into whether ullrich defrauded his t-mobile team by taking performance-enhancing drugs , thus illegally increasing his income .
german law allows the defendant to opt for an out-of-court settlement .
while the deal ends the criminal investigation , further civil proceedings in connection with those allegations could still be brought up in court .
authorities convinced of doping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did ullrich defraud his team ?
" our investigations over 21 months have shown that ullrich had doped , " bonn prosecutor fred apostel told dpa news agency .
ullrich decided he could n't compete as a cyclist unless he participated in doping , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office .
ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 , insists he is innocent .
in a statement on his web site , ullrich said the decision to make the payment , the majority of which will be donated to an un-specified charitable organization , was not an admission of guilt .
" there could be no admission because no one has been defrauded , " ullrich 's web site said .
ullrich said on his web site that he had not entered into a deal because he was worried about being found guilty , but rather to save his family from the pressure of a court case .
he also said he only agreed to the settlement as the money will be going to a good cause .
many cyclists under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of cyclists have been accused of doping ullrich is one of several cyclists to have been caught up in the operation puerto investigation into a cycling doping ring with spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes .
in 2006 , police found large quantities of anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and 200 bags of blood linked to more than 50 cyclists .
bonn prosecutors have said they have proof of payments between ullrich and fuentes .
dna analysis has shown that 4.5 liters of blood stored by the doctors belonged to ullrich .
the accusations led ullrich into early retirement .
a former teammate , joerg jaksche , who has admitted to doping said that he thinks it 's right that the allegations of fraud be dropped because " if doping was the usual thing he has not defrauded anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2008 wal-mart heads east , setting sights on russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart 's store growth abroad is expected to exceed that in the us this year wal-mart , the world 's largest retailer , said it aimed to expand into russia and eastern europe .
the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? merkel 's office has been flooded with questions about the more-than-usual amount of chancellor cleavage on display in the norwegian capital .
at the weekend inauguration of the oslo opera house , merkel wore a très décolleté black dress with a blue bolero . the dress stole some of the limelight from crown princesses victoria of sweden and mette-marit of norway , who generally outshine merkel in the glamour category by a substantial margin .

" but if the world has nothing more important to do than to talk about or report on evening dresses , what can one do ? " he said . merkel is certainly used to less flattering coverage of her appearance .
in the 1990s , her pageboy haircut and sensible shoes made her the butt of jokes .
in 2006 , the british tabloid the sun published photographs of merkel changing into her bathing suit , her rear end partially exposed . while merkel 's style has softened as chancellor , the 53-year-old is not considered a fashion trailblazer with the black trousers and boxy jackets she has almost made her uniform . so some commentators wondered if the dress signalled a general change in style .

is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? merkel 's office has been flooded with questions about the more-than-usual amount of chancellor cleavage on display in the norwegian capital .
at the weekend inauguration of the oslo opera house , merkel wore a très décolleté black dress with a blue bolero . the dress stole some of the limelight from crown princesses victoria of sweden and mette-marit of norway , who generally outshine merkel in the glamour category by a substantial margin .

" that this dress caused such a furor seemed excessive to the chancellor .

" but if the world has nothing more important to do than to talk about or report on evening dresses , what can one do ? " he said . merkel is certainly used to less flattering coverage of her appearance .
in the 1990s , her pageboy haircut and sensible shoes made her the butt of jokes .
in 2006 , the british tabloid the sun published photographs of merkel changing into her bathing suit , her rear end partially exposed . while merkel 's style has softened as chancellor , the 53-year-old is not considered a fashion trailblazer with the black trousers and boxy jackets she has almost made her uniform . so some commentators wondered if the dress signalled a general change in style .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2008 wal-mart heads east , setting sights on russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart 's store growth abroad is expected to exceed that in the us this year wal-mart , the world 's largest retailer , said it aimed to expand into russia and eastern europe .
the retail chain said it had recruited german retail executive stephan fanderl to scope out opportunities in the region . wal-mart chiefs want to expand into the rapidly developing russian market , with speculation circulating that the retailer has been seeking out potential partners , according to the british business daily financial times . russian media have reported that a partnership between wal-mart and the country 's leading food retailer , x5 , could be possible , pointing out that x5 also has contacts with tesco and carrefour .
german retail executive stephan fanderl is to take charge of the possible expansion in his new role as wal-mart 's president of emerging markets , the financial times reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart has already set up shop in china fanderl has previously worked for german retail group rewe as head of hypermarkets and supermarkets in germany .
eastern expansion after cold war leading european wal-mart rivals tesco , metro and carrefour all expanded into the eastern europe in the 1990s following the end of the cold war .
france 's carrefour has continued expansion and is expected to open two hypermarkets in moscow and krasnodar this year and add five openings next year .
wal-mart , on the other hand , has gone down a rocky road in europe .
the group 's acquisition of asda in the uk was considered a success , but germany has been a different story .
in 2006 , it sold over 80 stores in germany to the metro chain .
the us giant had struggled to establish itself in the country 's intensely competitive market , the world 's third-largest after the united states and japan .
" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in 2006 , explaining the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart faces stiff competition inside and outside of the united states in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany was believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . aiming not to repeat mistakes the financial times reported that wal-mart 's international stores account for 24 percent of its overall revenues , with the retailer eyeing increased international expansion as its us market reaches its saturation point .
this year , wal-mart 's rate of store growth overseas is expected to exceed that in the us for the first time in the chain 's history - with growth concentrated in in latin america , canada and china . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.04.2008 church influences europeans but has little political impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american cardinals may have a difficult time deciding who to support in the us election some wonder if the pope 's trip to the us is aimed at increasing the church 's political influence in the elections .
in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.04.2008 church influences europeans but has little political impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american cardinals may have a difficult time deciding who to support in the us election some wonder if the pope 's trip to the us is aimed at increasing the church 's political influence in the elections .
in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .
at its worst , 450,000 people lived in the warsaw ghetto . before world war ii , 3.5 million jews lived in poland , 400,000 in warsaw alone .
half of the six million jews killed in the holocaust were polish . in deference to religious jews , the official commemorative ceremonies were held on tuesday , since the anniversary falls on the jewish sabbath . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i want to send a signal by not taking part in the opening ceremony , " 27-year-old yvonne boenisch told german public broadcaster zdf on tuesday , april 15 . but boenisch , the first german woman to win a judo gold medal - at the olympics in athens in 2004 - ruled out that she would be boycotting the olympics games altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests along the olympics torch relay in london " participating in the olympics is every athlete 's biggest wish , " she said .
" a boycott now would shatter thousands of athletes ' dreams . " instead , during the games , boenisch plans to wear a wristband symbolizing her distain of china 's crackdown in tibet . other athletes headed to the olympics will likely be less vocal .
some french athletes had planned to wear jerseys bearing the slogan " for a better world " and displaying the olympic rings - to show their belief in respecting human rights . but , henri sérandour , president of the french national olympics committee , told l 'equipe tv that athletes participating in the olympics are not permitted to wear additional tags or badges on their uniforms . french secretary of sports bernard laporte , on the other hand , had welcomed the protest . " stage for expression " while german olympics officials have clearly pledged to send a team to the beijing games , guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , told deutsche welle this week that the debate about boycotting the olympic games in beijing should come to an end . bildunterschrift : protests began at the torch-lighting ceremony in athens in march instead , he said western visitors to the games " should take a stand " on the human rights issue . he said the international olympics committee should not prevent freedom of expression in the stadiums where sporting events are to take place , and said the games " should be optimally used to draw public attention to human rights ' abuses . " us athletes may be quieter numerous us athletes announced on monday that they would refrain from making political statements at the games , saying they would concentrate on winning medals . " we hope we are able to bring awareness to peace and team unity .
that 's our main objective .
winning the gold medal is where we can speak the loudest , by representing our country in the best way possible , " said 2004 us women 's soccer olympian heather o 'reilly . " we hope to bring the world together .
but that 's a lot to ask of an athlete , not only to go over and win a gold medal but also have these political views .

the insurrection against german occupiers was " a victory over human bestiality , " israel 's president said . alongside survivors , the presidents of poland and israel , lech kaczysnki and shimon peres , paid tribute to jews who took part in the warsaw ghetto uprising 65 years ago . " they lost the battle , but from history 's point of view there never was a greater victory , a victory of humanity over human bestiality , " said peres at the warsaw memorial to the heroes of the uprising . on april 19 , 1943 , jewish resistance groups revolted against units of the german army and the ss as they attempted to clear jews from the quarters they had been confined to in the polish city .
most of the jews involved were killed , but the rebellion marked a symbolic stand against the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres and kaczynski paid tribute to heroes and victims polish president kaczysnki said many acts of heroism had taken place during world war ii , " but among them the insurrection of the warsaw ghetto is exceptional .
the soldiers fought not for victory but for honor . " over 200 mainly young jews fought the germans for nearly a month .
around 7,000 jews were killed during the uprising and 43,000 deported to treblinka concentration camp .
marek edelman , one of the leaders of the revolt , was among the few who managed to escape .
symbol against nazism edelman was decorated with the french legion of honor by french foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday .
he was not present at the official ceremonies , which he has also shunned in the past , rejecting being glorified .
he plans to commemorate his friends at the warsaw uprising memorial on saturday , the date the uprising started .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelman is the last-surviving leader of the uprising " we knew perfectly well that there was no way we could win , " edelman told news agency afp .
" it was a symbol of the fight for freedom .
a symbol of standing up to nazism , and of not giving in . " after german troops occupied poland in 1939 , the nazis set up ghettos in many polish towns and forced the jewish population to live in the cramped areas before they were killed .
at its worst , 450,000 people lived in the warsaw ghetto . before world war ii , 3.5 million jews lived in poland , 400,000 in warsaw alone .
half of the six million jews killed in the holocaust were polish . in deference to religious jews , the official commemorative ceremonies were held on tuesday , since the anniversary falls on the jewish sabbath . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.04.2008 church influences europeans but has little political impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american cardinals may have a difficult time deciding who to support in the us election some wonder if the pope 's trip to the us is aimed at increasing the church 's political influence in the elections .
in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .

in europe , the church is influential on moral issues but has little impact on election outcomes . on tuesday april 15 , pope benedict xvi headed for the united states on his first official visit , where he met with president george w. bush and will address the united nations general assembly . while catholic leaders in the us hope the pontiff 's visit will revitalize americans ' views of the church , which has been plagued with pedophilia scandals , political observers wonder about the visit 's repercussions on november 's presidential election . but before former german cardinal joseph ratzinger - or any other clergy member - can give even a tacit endorsement in the us election , he 'd have to decide which candidate to support . none of the three contenders for us presidency is an ideal fit for the church , said sandro magister , a veteran vatican watcher who writes for the italian newsweekly l 'espresso . while republican nominee john mccain 's support of the iraq war puts him at odds with the vatican , the pro-choice convictions of the two democratic candidates - hillary clinton and barack obama - conflict with long-standing church policy , magister said . pope benedict xvi has often reiterated the church doctrine of his predecessor john paul ii on the sanctity of human life that begins at the moment of conception and ends with a natural death .
it makes not only abortion and euthanasia , but also the war in iraq - which the holy see opposes - mortal sins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of mccain 's view gel with church teachings reelected in spite of bishops ' protest back in europe , the clergy has traditionally had an easier time deciding where to offer its support .
the catholic church played a significant role in this year 's spanish election , even though the incumbent prime minister , socialist jose luis rodriguez zapertero , won a second term in march . early in his first term , zapatero had introduced legislation that was anathema to the catholic church , such as permitting gay couples to marry and adopt children , as well as easing restrictions on divorce and embryonic stem cell research .
spanish bishops had even organized a huge rally dubbed " christian family day " a few months before the election .
but most voters were more concerned about pocketbook issues than social agendas . a cardinal 's fierce campaign in italy , though , some say the church had a hand in bringing down romano prodi 's center-left government in january , thereby forcing new elections on april 13-14 .
the poll resulted in a victory for center-right media mogul silvio berlusconi , who is serving as italy 's premier for the third time now . the left-leaning us weekly the nation had singled out cardinal camillo ruini , the pope 's vicar general of rome for conducting a " fierce campaign " against prodi 's social policy , which included civil unions for gay couples and liberalizing laws on stem cell research and artificial insemination . the nation 's rome correspondent called ruini a " discreet force moving behind the scenes " in the collapse of prodi 's government and predicted that pope benedict xvi would launch a campaign on church doctrine in the united states . maciej golubiewski , an eu strategist at the catholic family and human rights institute , a non-partisan social policy group in washington dc , said the campaign to protest prodi 's platform on gay unions as well as abortion and euthanasia , was sanctioned by ruini .
however , he said , it was organized and staged by lay social movements within the church , not by the clergy . enough influence to tip the scales he added that in very close elections , the marginal power of a well-organized , politicized group that adheres strictly to religious doctrine can make a difference . " ruini is outspoken , and could have tipped the balance a bit in favor of berlusconi by energizing the debate on moral issues that a core group of devout church-going italian catholics care about , " said golubiewski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church may have been a deciding factor in the fall of prodi 's government " the bishops in italy would never openly endorse a candidate or tell their congregations who to vote for , but they might weigh in on a particular issue and say this is an issue that is important to catholics , so vote according to your conscience , " golubiewski said . abortion issues less influential in italy in america , abortion has been a hot button issue for both the church and politicians ever since the us supreme court 's landmark decision to legalize abortion was passed in 1973 .
presidential candidates ' stances on the issue make a big difference for many voters . this is much less the case in europe .
berlusconi had won a clear victory over his center-left rival walter veltroni in the polls , with social issues having little impact on the elections , according to vatican observers .
voters in italy were also focused more on other issues , such as the economy , rather than legitimizing gay unions . fringe candidate draws attention to abortion however , in the run up to the italian elections , giuliano ferrara , a berlusconi associate who ran for parliament on a single platform , called for a universal moratorium on abortion , and wound up drawing media attention to an issue that had been buried three decades ago .
italy 's law , which is in line with most eu states , allows abortion on demand for the first three months of pregnancy , but the vatican has generally left the legality of the issue alone . although ferrara 's anti-abortion campaign drew church supporters such as cardinal ruini , it hardly had an impact on the italian elections at all , said father eberhard von gemmingen , a jesuit priest who is head of vatican radio 's german section and is close to pope benedict xvi . sandro magister pointed out that the church had used the publicity generated by ferrara to open up a debate on reducing the number of abortions .
" the vatican has no intention of using its clout to revoke italy 's liberal laws , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fringe candidate in the italian elections had made abortion a campaign issue " but there are women who choose to end a pregnancy for reasons of poverty , so the church is saying financial help could do something about reducing the ' need ' for abortion , " said magister . religiosity regardless of party affiliation in the us , devout , church-going christians for whom social issues are very important tend to vote republican and can carry enough clout to affect election outcomes , according to golubiewski . four years ago , when john kerry , a democrat and a catholic , ran for president and declared himself to be pro-choice , several american bishops said they would deny him communion , and he lost some christian votes for his abortion stance . but in italy , magister pointed out , romano prodi , a devout catholic , was not adversely affected by taking stances in opposition to those of the church . berlusconi , on the other hand , who has not shown himself to be religious , is closer to the official church position on social issues . father von gemmingen made the distinction between prodi 's private beliefs and his public duty as prime minister .
" it is possible to be personally opposed to abortion in keeping with catholic doctrine , but we can not expect politicians to apply that article of faith to everyone else , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in what concerns the leadership of the party , for the head of government it is a natural , successful and civilized practice in all democratic states ... and that is why i gratefully thank the party for their proposal and agree to take the head of the united russia party , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks at a congress of the united russia party united russia is seen as an appendage of the presidential administration , uniting almost all russia 's regional governors and top politicians under one banner .
during putin 's eight years in the kremlin , he has steadily centralized power , with united russia seen as his tool for ensuring the loyalty of an emasculated parliament . as its ruler and the country 's most popular politician , putin , 55 , is set to become russia 's most powerful prime minister ever , undercutting the presidency three weeks before he hands over the 42-year-old medvedev . reorganization some united russia members tuesday hailed putin 's leadership as a " radical " reorganization in the balance of power toward a parliamentary republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and medvevev , all smiles " analysts and those in the media are still trying to figure out who portrait will end up hanging in government offices across the country , " commentator konstatin sonin wrote in tuesday 's moscow times newspaper . some analysts said putin consolidates power in the party as an alternative to the so-called " power vertical " or putin 's steady centralization of resources in the presidency in his eight-year rule . but others discounted rumours of change , calling the party a weak and loose " club of bureaucrats and businessmen . " " putin will take a ceremonial , high-ranking post immune to criticism and without a great burden of responsibility which can offer him independence and security , " the head of the national strategy institute , stanislav belkovsky , told the dpa news agency . soviet-era throwback in a scene reminiscent of soviet-era mass party conventions , some 600 delegates tuesday held up a sea of white cards first to vote for an amendment to the charter creating the new post tailored to putin , and then to unanimously elect him to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united russia party conference the party presented a glitzy photographic album of tributes to putin by figures ranging from mikhail gorbachev to soviet writer and former dissident alexander solzhenitsyn . " putin inherited a country looted and knocked to its knees , with the majority of the population demoralized and impoverished .
and he started , little by little , gradually , its rebuilding , " solzhenitsyn was quoted as saying . putin , whose popularity earned the party its 315 out of 450-seat rule in russia 's duma , said he would work to ensure it acts " as a single organism in the interest of the russian people . " the two-day party rally was adjourned immediately after medvedev and putin delivered their quick one-two , entering and exiting the hall walking side-by-side in classic style .
the two have promised to rule in tandem and there are no visible signs of conflict . russia 's president has the power to appoint and fire the prime minister , but he must win parliament 's approval , whose majority party putin will now head . chairman , but not member putin becomes party chairman without officially joining united russia , which many see as a corrupt group of functionaries . with this symbolic distance putin encourages the czarist-like appellation of national leader heard from party delegates . he also rejects being part of mundane of party politics and throws off comparisons to the general secretary of communist party of the soviet union -lrb- cpsu -rrb- . putin " is preserving his independence .
he strengthens his role as national leader , " kremlin-linked analyst sergei markov said on the sidelines of the conference . " medvedev will be president , but the political leader of the country remains putin , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

matt carver , 22 , from newport , has been diagnosed with leukaemia , and gaer junior school and a cancer charity are appealing for donors .
the oxford student said former pupils had contacted him saying they intended to go along , taking colleagues and friends along with them .
the clinic at the school will be open between 1600 and 1900 bst .
" when i was diagnosed , the world collapsed from under my feet , " he said .
but he did not feel unwell when he found out he had acute myloid leukaemia in january .
course his mother and fiancé noticed he had numerous bruises on his leg and he had a cut on his hand which would not stop bleeding .
his doctor thought there might be a problem with the coagulation of his blood , but following tests he was diagnosed with cancer .
he has recently finished his second course of chemotherapy at john radcliffe hospital in oxford .
providing a donor can be found , doctors are hopeful of carrying out a bone marrow transplant in may or june .
he then hopes he can resume his masters in medieval history at brasenose college later next year .
' touching ' the idea for the school clinic came from his family and friends .
" it 's so touching people care that much , " he said .
" people from school that i have n't seen for four years have been calling to say they 're going along and taking colleagues and friends . "
the clinic will be run by the anthony nolan trust , and caroline berger from the charity urged young people to join the donor register .
" the bigger the register , the better chance everyone has of finding a match , " she said .
" there are currently 16,000 people worldwide searching for a life-saving donor . "
the trust is responsible for finding matches for all uk patients in need of bone marrow transplants .

dr stephen gwyther , from surrey & sussex healthcare nhs trust , said the machine could capture 64 images at once of any part of the body .
the friends of east surrey hospital raised £ 465,000 for the scanner , now installed in the radiology department .
the hospital in redhill serves east surrey and north west sussex .
dr gwyther said : " it has a much greater capacity than our other two scanners , and means we can give a quicker , more efficient service to our patients , improve diagnosis and begin follow-up treatment earlier .
" radiology staff are being trained to operate the new machine which we hope will soon be fully operational . "
' vital equipment ' he said examinations could be carried out in seconds rather than minutes with the hi-tech machine .
computer-generated 3d reconstructions of the body can also be routinely generated to aid diagnosis .
the friends of east surrey hospital financed the machine by donating £ 374,000 profit from their two hospital shops - the charity 's largest donation to date .
the rest of the money for " this vital piece of equipment " came from legacies and a fund-raising ball , charity chairman richard burford said .

dr stephen gwyther , from surrey & sussex healthcare nhs trust , said the machine could capture 64 images at once of any part of the body .
the friends of east surrey hospital raised £ 465,000 for the scanner , now installed in the radiology department .
the hospital in redhill serves east surrey and north west sussex .
dr gwyther said : " it has a much greater capacity than our other two scanners , and means we can give a quicker , more efficient service to our patients , improve diagnosis and begin follow-up treatment earlier .
" radiology staff are being trained to operate the new machine which we hope will soon be fully operational . "
' vital equipment ' he said examinations could be carried out in seconds rather than minutes with the hi-tech machine .
computer-generated 3d reconstructions of the body can also be routinely generated to aid diagnosis .
the friends of east surrey hospital financed the machine by donating £ 374,000 profit from their two hospital shops - the charity 's largest donation to date .
the rest of the money for " this vital piece of equipment " came from legacies and a fund-raising ball , charity chairman richard burford said .

mr berlusconi , who is due to return to rome from his home in northern italy on tuesday , won control of both the senate and lower house of parliament .
the decisive victory gives him a third term as prime minister .
after being congratulated by defeated rival walter veltroni , the media mogul said he would work with the opposition to pass much-needed economic reforms .
the polls were held three years ahead of schedule following the collapse of romano prodi 's centre-left coalition .
mr berlusconi 's new government will be italy 's 62nd since world war ii .
with virtually all of the votes counted , the interior ministry said mr berlusconi 's party had taken 47 % of the vote , compared with 38 % for mr veltroni 's centre-left , in both the senate and the lower chamber of deputies .
that translates into a 101-seat lead in the chamber , and a 38-seat advantage in the senate .
the results have reshaped italian politics , says the bbc 's jonny dymond in rome , slashing the number of parties winning representation in the chamber from 26 to as few as six .
but , our correspondent adds , mr berlusconi will still need to do difficult deals with potential partners .
the northern league , which wants extensive autonomy for italy 's regions , nearly doubled its vote , and without its support mr berlusconi would lose his majority .
in a telephone call to rai tv on monday night , mr berlusconi said his slimmed-down cabinet would have 12 ministers , including four women . "
but is n't he a corrupt buffoon , you may ask ? "
robin lustig 's blog read robin 's thoughts in full he added that he was moved by the faith that so many citizens had placed in him .
" we have difficult months ahead that will require great strength , " he said .
before ringing off , he added : " an affectionate kiss to all italians . "
massive debt mr berlusconi said his immediate priorities would be settling the future of the loss-making national airline alitalia and the crisis caused by uncollected mountains of rubbish in naples .
his government also faces the task of reviving italy 's ailing economy , with zero growth forecast for the coming year .
although italy is saddled with a massive public debt , he has promised tax cuts and handouts to voters .
italy 's economy has been suffering from low productivity and a strong euro , and analysts say young people , pensioners and low-income workers are feeling the pressure .
some 158 different parties contested the regional and national polls , including mr berlusconi 's new conservative people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- and mr veltroni 's recently formed democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- .
at 80 % , the final turnout appears to have been lower than in the last election two years ago .
mr berlusconi has served two previous terms as prime minister , last resigning in may 2006 after losing a bitterly contested election .
one of italy 's richest men , he is the head of a business empire that spans media , advertising , insurance , food and construction , and includes the top flight football club ac milan .

mr berlusconi , who is due to return to rome from his home in northern italy on tuesday , won control of both the senate and lower house of parliament .
the decisive victory gives him a third term as prime minister .
after being congratulated by defeated rival walter veltroni , the media mogul said he would work with the opposition to pass much-needed economic reforms .
the polls were held three years ahead of schedule following the collapse of romano prodi 's centre-left coalition .
mr berlusconi 's new government will be italy 's 62nd since world war ii .
with virtually all of the votes counted , the interior ministry said mr berlusconi 's party had taken 47 % of the vote , compared with 38 % for mr veltroni 's centre-left , in both the senate and the lower chamber of deputies .
that translates into a 101-seat lead in the chamber , and a 38-seat advantage in the senate .
the results have reshaped italian politics , says the bbc 's jonny dymond in rome , slashing the number of parties winning representation in the chamber from 26 to as few as six .
but , our correspondent adds , mr berlusconi will still need to do difficult deals with potential partners .

but mr parker conserves by killing .
his chosen prey is the north american grey squirrel .
the animals are first trapped and then despatched .
his northumberland-based organisation , the red squirrel protection partnership , say they have culled more than 15,000 squirrels in little over a year .
that works out as approximately 200 squirrels a week .
so why does he do it ?
mr parker is clear : " they are carrying squirrel pox which kills the reds .
they also hammer the bird population , they kill the chicks to get into nest boxes and they eat eggs .
" we are going to end up losing all our reds within 10 years if we do n't take these out of the equation . "
i only use a rifle , it 's the best way , it 's the quickest way paul parker i joined mr parker on an ordinary day of squirrel hunting .
a government grant of £ 150,000 pays for his services and his traps .
dozens of hazelnut-stuffed metal cages are placed in gardens and woodlands across the county .
homeowners provide mr parker with squirrel intelligence .
once they see the animal trapped , they either call or text him .
he then administers the fatal blow .
" i only use a rifle , it 's the best way , it 's the quickest way .
there is a little spot on the back of the head .
if you hit it , in one shot , it is dead . "
kill cage a text alerts mr parker to a trapped grey in a suburban garden on the outskirts of newcastle .
when we arrive , the trapper takes with him his kill cage .
it will be used to transfer the squirrel so that it can be culled away from the house .
when we get to the squirrel , it is scurrying about trying to escape .
it is transferred and a few minutes later in a nearby woodland it is shot .
it 's estimated the north is home to 80 % of england 's native red squirrels .
but their numbers are low - thought to be between 20,000 and 30,000 .
compare that to the three to five million greys believed to be in the uk .
but not everyone is convinced that a mass cull is the best way to redress this imbalance .
a spokesman for the royal society for the protection of animals said : " the rspca believes that control must not be interpreted solely as lethal control , and urges the investigation of alternative measures to reduce the impact of grey squirrels on reds , whilst ensuring both reds and greys do not suffer .
" we support a more measured approach .
eradicating long-established entire populations of greys , as well as being ethically questionable , would be very difficult and cause unnecessary suffering . "

delicacy ?

the last two grey squirrel loins are on sale in the window .
the furry creatures have become the latest game delicacy .
david ridley has been selling squirrel for several weeks now .
he told me : " we sell quite a lot on the market and to local restaurants .
the shop manages to sell quite a bit . "
i leave paul parker to continue his controversial culling .
his ambition is to take his skills south and eventually clear the last grey squirrel out of london 's hyde park .
with millions of squirrels along the way , that is unlikely to be realised .

his northumberland-based organisation , the red squirrel protection partnership , say they have culled more than 15,000 squirrels in little over a year .
that works out as approximately 200 squirrels a week .
so why does he do it ?
mr parker is clear : " they are carrying squirrel pox which kills the reds .

but not everyone is convinced that a mass cull is the best way to redress this imbalance .
a spokesman for the royal society for the protection of animals said : " the rspca believes that control must not be interpreted solely as lethal control , and urges the investigation of alternative measures to reduce the impact of grey squirrels on reds , whilst ensuring both reds and greys do not suffer .

advertisement moose back in the scottish highlands -lrb- footage : bbc natural world -rrb- " when you have radical ideas like this , people think you 're a crackpot , " says paul lister .
the scottish landowner is a man on a mission .
he plans to wind back the clock at his estate in the highlands by repopulating the land with a raft of animals that have not been seen in britain for hundreds of years - including brown bears , lynx and wolves .
" what i 'm aiming is to create a wilderness and wildlife reserve similar to those that exist in southern africa ; something that is controlled , managed and fenced , " he told bbc news .
" it is nothing like britain or europe has ever seen before . "
i get quite angry when i think about the fact that when we want to put back just 1 % of the highlands , we get potential resentment from some quarters paul lister the idea for the proposed project came to mr lister years ago .
he explained : " the main problem we have in scotland is a complete overpopulation of red deer .
we probably have triple or quadruple the number of red deer than we can sustain .
" when i was 20 , i was out shooting deer and i started thinking about why we were having to cull so many of them .
and the reason was that we got rid of all the predators years ago .
" by bringing large predators back - wolves , lynxes and bears - then we would end up with a more healthy and balanced population of ungulates . "
he is keen to point out that he is not trying to reintroduce animals back into the wild , rather he is aiming for a " controlled release " into a 50,000 acre -lrb- 20,000 hectare -rrb- fenced enclosure .
bringing back moose a bbc natural world team has been following mr lister set up his multi-million pound scheme .
and it has all started with animals that have not been seen in the wild in britain for many centuries - a pair of moose -lrb- alces alces , also referred to as elk in europe -rrb- .
they have recently arrived from sweden and have been settling into a 450 acre -lrb- 180 hectare -rrb- enclosure within mr lister 's alladale estate .
they join some newly introduced wild boar and also 80,000 caledonian pine , juniper , hazel and birch trees , which have recently been planted to bring back the land that he bought four years ago from its " desert state " .

the moose were flown in to scotland from sweden -lrb- footage : bbc natural world -rrb- but while a couple of moose and some new flora are unlikely to attract too much debate , the proposed plan to introduce larger predators to his fenced reserve has provoked more controversy .
local farmers are worried about the impact on local livestock should any large predators escape from the alladale estate .
on the other hand , the proposed fence to keep animals in is worrying local ramblers who want to safeguard their right to roam .
and while some ecologists are onboard with mr lister 's idea , others have concerns .
timothy coulson , professor of population biology at imperial college london , says : " in many ways , i think this is a nice idea and i applaud him for investing the time and money to see if this will work .
" however , the proposed area for the reserve is too small to viably support , in the long run , an ecosystem containing large predators .
" a single pack of wolves will cover a huge territory , so in 50,000 acres you could probably just have one pack , and for long term survival , the animal population would have to be actively managed . "
wolves were hunted to extinction in the uk about 200 years ago mr lister points out that there is still much to do before larger predators can be brought in .
for a start , he says , he needs to increase the size of his estate from 23,000 acres to 50,000 acres and there is also the need to bring his neighbours on board , as well as to navigate through the reams of red tape the project would involve .
however , he is optimistic , and believes the reserve could be up and running in two to five years .
he told the bbc : " we have covered our countryside with motorways , highways , buildings , golf courses and so on to our own benefit and satisfaction to the detriment of every animal that has ever lived there .
" i get quite angry when i think about the fact that when we want to put back just 1 % of the highlands , we get potential resentment from some quarters .
" when someone wants to come along and do something good for the native flora and fauna , we ought to put our hands up and get on with it . "

like many in the city , i was hesitant about contacting the police .
for some there is a feeling that there is little point ; for others a general distrust of them .
but this under-reporting of crime is one of the motivations behind a new interactive website called wikicrimes , created by professor vasco furtado from the university of fortaleza in northern brazil .
" the idea is very simple ; when people are robbed it 's quite common for them to tell other people , " he tells me .
" with wikicrimes this information will be available globally . "
police response as a recent victim of crime myself , i decided to test out the site .
i am given a map of brazil , and can zoom in to where i was robbed .
after finding the street , i put a marker on it .
if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking denis mizne , sou de paz i then fill in a series of question boxes regarding things like whether the person was armed and whether anyone else can confirm the crime happened .
" the other principal reason behind the creation of the site is the unavailability of police crime data to the public , " says professor furtado .
" we have a problem in brazil , in that crime data is a monopoly of the police .
there are a lot of debate if there is a manipulation or not of the data . "
he adds that he sent a message to all the police departments in brazil explaining about the project and asking if they wanted to include their data on the site .
so far , he has received no positive responses .
but antenor martins of rio 's civil police department , who investigates crime on the internet , says the police have their reasons for not revealing data .
" we are very worried about revealing police data which may restrict the work of the police , " he explains .
" also we do n't want a feeling of insecurity for the people - they do n't deserve that here or anywhere else in the world . "
and not all people want a crime profile or map of an area .
another victim , 24-year-old melissa from sao paulo , says that she feels profiling areas like this risks discriminating the people from those areas .
" there 's also good people there , " she says .
" or they are very poor , and that 's why i was robbed .
i do n't think it 's a very good idea . "
big initiative and officer antenor junior of rio 's civil police department is sceptical about the validity of the information people put into wikicrimes .
" the principal problem is the lack of someone to check that the information is true , " he says .
wikicrimes pinpoints crime hotspots in the country " when people walk into a police station , you sign an incident report .
if you give information which is n't true you have to respond to charges of giving false evidence . "
but other organisations have welcomed wikicrimes - such as the sao paulo-based non-governmental organisation sou de paz , which works to reduce violence in brazil .
" if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking - things that affect communities but that people do n't report either because of shame or fear , " says sou de paz 's denis mizne .
" if you can get access to this information or publicise it together with wikicrimes , it could help in areas that suffer most from violent crime . "
meanwhile professor furtado stresses that at this early stage his main aim is getting public participation and interest in the site .
" i think this will be the first big initiative for doing this in brazil , " he says .
" in terms of crime it would be nice if this would show that its necessary to publish the crime data that we have in law authorities and institutions .
" if this is a success , i am sure that all the crime data will be available for people , because they will realise there is no way that the authorities can keep it all to themselves . "

another victim , 24-year-old melissa from sao paulo , says that she feels profiling areas like this risks discriminating the people from those areas .
" there 's also good people there , " she says .
" or they are very poor , and that 's why i was robbed .
i do n't think it 's a very good idea . "
big initiative and officer antenor junior of rio 's civil police department is sceptical about the validity of the information people put into wikicrimes .
" the principal problem is the lack of someone to check that the information is true , " he says .
wikicrimes pinpoints crime hotspots in the country " when people walk into a police station , you sign an incident report .
if you give information which is n't true you have to respond to charges of giving false evidence . "
but other organisations have welcomed wikicrimes - such as the sao paulo-based non-governmental organisation sou de paz , which works to reduce violence in brazil .
" if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking - things that affect communities but that people do n't report either because of shame or fear , " says sou de paz 's denis mizne .
" if you can get access to this information or publicise it together with wikicrimes , it could help in areas that suffer most from violent crime . "
meanwhile professor furtado stresses that at this early stage his main aim is getting public participation and interest in the site .
" i think this will be the first big initiative for doing this in brazil , " he says .
" in terms of crime it would be nice if this would show that its necessary to publish the crime data that we have in law authorities and institutions .
" if this is a success , i am sure that all the crime data will be available for people , because they will realise there is no way that the authorities can keep it all to themselves . "

like many in the city , i was hesitant about contacting the police .
for some there is a feeling that there is little point ; for others a general distrust of them .
but this under-reporting of crime is one of the motivations behind a new interactive website called wikicrimes , created by professor vasco furtado from the university of fortaleza in northern brazil .
" the idea is very simple ; when people are robbed it 's quite common for them to tell other people , " he tells me .
" with wikicrimes this information will be available globally . "
police response as a recent victim of crime myself , i decided to test out the site .
i am given a map of brazil , and can zoom in to where i was robbed .
after finding the street , i put a marker on it .
if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking denis mizne , sou de paz i then fill in a series of question boxes regarding things like whether the person was armed and whether anyone else can confirm the crime happened .
" the other principal reason behind the creation of the site is the unavailability of police crime data to the public , " says professor furtado .
" we have a problem in brazil , in that crime data is a monopoly of the police .
there are a lot of debate if there is a manipulation or not of the data . "
he adds that he sent a message to all the police departments in brazil explaining about the project and asking if they wanted to include their data on the site .
so far , he has received no positive responses .
but antenor martins of rio 's civil police department , who investigates crime on the internet , says the police have their reasons for not revealing data .
" we are very worried about revealing police data which may restrict the work of the police , " he explains .
" also we do n't want a feeling of insecurity for the people - they do n't deserve that here or anywhere else in the world . "
and not all people want a crime profile or map of an area .
another victim , 24-year-old melissa from sao paulo , says that she feels profiling areas like this risks discriminating the people from those areas .
" there 's also good people there , " she says .
" or they are very poor , and that 's why i was robbed .
i do n't think it 's a very good idea . "
big initiative and officer antenor junior of rio 's civil police department is sceptical about the validity of the information people put into wikicrimes .
" the principal problem is the lack of someone to check that the information is true , " he says .
wikicrimes pinpoints crime hotspots in the country " when people walk into a police station , you sign an incident report .
if you give information which is n't true you have to respond to charges of giving false evidence . "
but other organisations have welcomed wikicrimes - such as the sao paulo-based non-governmental organisation sou de paz , which works to reduce violence in brazil .
" if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking - things that affect communities but that people do n't report either because of shame or fear , " says sou de paz 's denis mizne .
" if you can get access to this information or publicise it together with wikicrimes , it could help in areas that suffer most from violent crime . "
meanwhile professor furtado stresses that at this early stage his main aim is getting public participation and interest in the site .
" i think this will be the first big initiative for doing this in brazil , " he says .
" in terms of crime it would be nice if this would show that its necessary to publish the crime data that we have in law authorities and institutions .
" if this is a success , i am sure that all the crime data will be available for people , because they will realise there is no way that the authorities can keep it all to themselves . "

" if we develop a project with wikicrimes , we can look at things like domestic violence or information on drug trafficking - things that affect communities but that people do n't report either because of shame or fear , " says sou de paz 's denis mizne .
" if you can get access to this information or publicise it together with wikicrimes , it could help in areas that suffer most from violent crime . "
meanwhile professor furtado stresses that at this early stage his main aim is getting public participation and interest in the site .
" i think this will be the first big initiative for doing this in brazil , " he says .
" in terms of crime it would be nice if this would show that its necessary to publish the crime data that we have in law authorities and institutions .
" if this is a success , i am sure that all the crime data will be available for people , because they will realise there is no way that the authorities can keep it all to themselves . "

the 2nd century ad sculpture , found in the river thames 174 years ago , is to feature at an exhibition at segedunum fort at hadrian 's wall in wallsend .
the head , originally part of a statue , is on loan from the british museum and has already been shown in carlisle .
emperor hadrian ordered the building of a 73 mile-long wall to protect the roman frontier from scottish tribes .
he ruled the roman empire at its height from ad 117 to 138 .
it is believed the statue would have been on public display in london in ad 122 to commemorate his visit to britain .
the underwater silts of the thames , where the head was dumped , protected it and ensured it was well preserved .
the exhibition of the head begins on wednesday and runs until 8 june .

the royal institution of chartered surveyors ' -lrb- rics -rrb- said that 78.5 % more surveyors reported a fall than a rise in house prices in march .
this was the gloomiest reading since rics began the survey in 1978 .
the government 's own house price figures confirmed a fall in prices in february by 1.6 % .
the results come after leading mortgage lenders have offered similarly downbeat views on property prices .
rics said the next six months would be crucial for homeowners and would-be buyers in the uk .
historical low the rics house price balance dropped for the eighth consecutive month .
it exceeded the previously lowest reading in june 1990 .
jeremy leaf , rics spokesman , said the gloom was the result of the credit crunch and its effect in stopping mortgage providers lending to each other .
" sentiment is at a very low ebb and will continue to remain depressed while the economy suffers from this unique liquidity blight , " he said .
but he added that a significant crash in prices remained unlikely and buyers with access to large deposits had the chance to get their hands on property they could not previously aspire to .
following the trend the survey follows march reports from the uk 's two biggest mortgage lenders which reported month-on-month falls in house prices and predictions of a fall throughout 2008 .
last week , the halifax reported a 2.5 % fall in prices in march , the biggest monthly decline since september 1992 and the slowest annual growth for 12 years . "
many would-be buyers are either struggling to raise the necessary finance to precipitate a move or are exercising caution in the light of current economic uncertainty " rics surveyors ' views across the uk sympathy for estate agents ?
hoping for a housing crash scotland bucks the trend prime minister gordon brown and chancellor alistair darling are meeting banks and mortgage lenders to discuss liquidity - widely regarded as the key factor affecting mortgage availability .
the problems in the financial markets has meant lenders are keen only to attract low-risk customers who can offer a significant deposit .
some 49 % more surveyors reported a fall than a rise in new buyer enquiries , against 39 % in january .
" many would-be buyers are either struggling to raise the necessary finance to precipitate a move or are exercising caution in the light of current economic uncertainty , " rics said .
falls in price the falls in prices are particularly marked for flats and maisonettes and in certain parts of the country . "
we need to tread very , very carefully before making long-term judgements on the market at this current , unsettled , time " peter bolton king , national association of estate agents the sharpest falls were in the east midlands and east anglia , while slower falls were recorded in north-west england , wales and london .
scotland continued to buck the trend , with house prices reported to be rising slightly .
the stock of unsold property on surveyors ' books declined by 1.3 % compared with february , but up 50 % over the year .
peter bolton king , chief executive of the national association of estate agents -lrb- naea -rrb- warned against doom-mongering , saying the housing market was still underpinned by strong economic factors .
" the market is battling with the credit crunch , which has undoubtedly had an effect on confidence , " he said .
" however , the key factors that underpin the housing market still exist - low unemployment , historically low interest rates and a pent-up demand for houses .
have your say " brown has defied all economic principles and destroyed what was a healthy economy riding on the back of a made up housing boom and cheap credit " steven , london send us your comments " we can see from the figures that it is not all doom and gloom out there and we need to tread very , very carefully before making long-term judgements on the market at this current , unsettled , time . "
government figures meanwhile , the government 's own house price survey , also published on tuesday , confirmed a fall in house prices in february , down 1.6 % on the previous month .
the department for communities and local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- survey runs a month behind other house price indexes as it is based on sale completions , rather than mortgage approvals .
it put the average house price in the uk in february at £ 217,737 .
in the three months to the end of february , property prices fell by 0.5 % , against a fall of 0.2 % in the previous quarter .
annual house price inflation in the uk was down from 8 % in january to 6.7 % in february , with the slowdown particularly marked in london -lrb- down from 13.8 % to 9.5 % -rrb- .
again , scotland showed the highest year-on-year rise in prices , at 9.7 % .

shot in the neck by a teenager on a mountain bike , the " bubbly and popular " everton fc fan died in the car park of a pub in croxteth , liverpool .
detectives said the schoolboy had become the innocent victim of a gangland feud and appealed directly to local gangs for help to catch the killer .
but despite 20 arrests in the six months following the shooting - 17 on suspicion of murder - nobody has yet been charged with the killing .
on tuesday , 12 more people were arrested by merseyside police in a series of dawn raids in the croxteth area .
it is the latest twist in a long-running police inquiry .
' we know ' in november 2007 - three months after the killing - detectives said they knew who murdered the schoolboy .
merseyside police chief constable bernard hogan-howe said it was only a matter of time before the killer was caught . "

he said : " if the person is listening , we are confident we know who you are and are building a case against you . "
residents living in croxteth described the killing as " horrific " but complained there had been long-running problems with gangs in the area .
one told the bbc : " this has been a long time coming .

" there 's loads of kids hanging round here .
you 're too frightened to go to the shops or to the pub , pensioners are too frightened to go to church on sunday . "
meanwhile , rhys 's family and friends struggled to come to terms with the schoolboy 's death .
in september , more than 2,500 mourners packed into liverpool 's anglican cathedral for the funeral of the schoolboy .
hundreds of people wore their brightest clothes to celebrate rhys 's short life .
as workers from a nearby building site downed tools to pay their respects , inside the church father andrew unsworth told the congregation that liverpool had been " shamed by such a crime " .
later that month , rhys 's parents melanie and stephen jones urged a mystery caller who contacted police days after the killing to get back in touch .
facing a week in which they should have been celebrating rhys 's 12th birthday and their 20th wedding anniversary , the couple pleaded for help in catching the killer .
mrs jones said : " we need the person who killed our son to be brought to justice to give us a bit of peace . "
in february , detectives said they believed they had found the gun used to kill the 11-year-old , and identified the exact make of bicycle used by the gunman .
following a series of appeals , including two on the bbc 's crimewatch programme , police said they were " confident " about the progress which had been made in the six months since rhys 's death .

shot in the neck by a teenager on a mountain bike , the " bubbly and popular " everton fc fan died in the car park of a pub in croxteth , liverpool .
detectives said the schoolboy had become the innocent victim of a gangland feud and appealed directly to local gangs for help to catch the killer .
but despite 20 arrests in the six months following the shooting - 17 on suspicion of murder - nobody has yet been charged with the killing .
on tuesday , 12 more people were arrested by merseyside police in a series of dawn raids in the croxteth area .
it is the latest twist in a long-running police inquiry .

merseyside police chief constable bernard hogan-howe said it was only a matter of time before the killer was caught .
we need the person who killed our son to be brought to justice to give us a sense of peace melanie jones he dismissed reports that officers had been met with a wall of silence in croxteth by people fearful of reprisals .
he said : " if the person is listening , we are confident we know who you are and are building a case against you . "
residents living in croxteth described the killing as " horrific " but complained there had been long-running problems with gangs in the area .

i 've half-expected something like this for a while now .
" there 's loads of kids hanging round here .
you 're too frightened to go to the shops or to the pub , pensioners are too frightened to go to church on sunday . "
the congregation was told liverpool had been ' shamed ' by the murder meanwhile , rhys 's family and friends struggled to come to terms with the schoolboy 's death .
in september , more than 2,500 mourners packed into liverpool 's anglican cathedral for the funeral of the schoolboy .
hundreds of people wore their brightest clothes to celebrate rhys 's short life .
as workers from a nearby building site downed tools to pay their respects , inside the church father andrew unsworth told the congregation that liverpool had been " shamed by such a crime " .
later that month , rhys 's parents melanie and stephen jones urged a mystery caller who contacted police days after the killing to get back in touch .
facing a week in which they should have been celebrating rhys 's 12th birthday and their 20th wedding anniversary , the couple pleaded for help in catching the killer .
mrs jones said : " we need the person who killed our son to be brought to justice to give us a bit of peace . "
in february , detectives said they believed they had found the gun used to kill the 11-year-old , and identified the exact make of bicycle used by the gunman .
following a series of appeals , including two on the bbc 's crimewatch programme , police said they were " confident " about the progress which had been made in the six months since rhys 's death .
