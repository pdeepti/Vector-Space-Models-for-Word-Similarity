after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel vows to back french eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's eu presidency could give sarkozy the power to promote his policies german chancellor merkel has said ahead of a one-day summit on monday with president sarkozy in germany that she will fully support france 's eu presidency next month despite ongoing differences . merkel told daily straubinger tagblatt ahead of a franco-german summit monday that sarkozy could count on berlin 's help on thorny issues such as climate protection and european union institutional reforms during paris ' six-month stint at the helm . " germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .

obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .
he said many western europeans were attracted to the idea of a us president " who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them " . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .

germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .
“ being a parent puts constant pressure on the employment rate of women , whereas it does not affect that of men at all .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi 's rejoicing was low-key after goals on poland " poldi " was the only german player to take a victory lap in a red poland shirt , that of opponent mariusz lewandowski .
the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .
“ being a parent puts constant pressure on the employment rate of women , whereas it does not affect that of men at all .

berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .

one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .

the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .

i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .

-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .

the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .

there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?

“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued .

“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "
" i 'd be delighted if we would have an america like that , an america that wants to tackle those problems , " he said .
obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .

commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .

working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi 's rejoicing was low-key after goals on poland " poldi " was the only german player to take a victory lap in a red poland shirt , that of opponent mariusz lewandowski .
the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .
many now say the team is at their peak for euro 2008 .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued .

“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise .

ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .

in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .

it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "

with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .

berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all .

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live european journal - the magazine from brussels we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "
" i 'd be delighted if we would have an america like that , an america that wants to tackle those problems , " he said .
obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .
he said many western europeans were attracted to the idea of a us president " who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them " . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .

eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .
“ being a parent puts constant pressure on the employment rate of women , whereas it does not affect that of men at all .
that is no longer acceptable , ” spindla said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .

in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

but the call went to germany nonetheless .

“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

uwe mueller , lufthansa 's asia pacific vice president , said the airline was " in good shape " despite runaway oil prices , news agency afp reported .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uwe mueller , lufthansa 's asia pacific vice president , said the airline was " in good shape " despite runaway oil prices , news agency afp reported .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .

berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .

" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all .

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .

the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi 's rejoicing was low-key after goals on poland " poldi " was the only german player to take a victory lap in a red poland shirt , that of opponent mariusz lewandowski .
the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .
many now say the team is at their peak for euro 2008 .

“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise .

in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel vows to back french eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's eu presidency could give sarkozy the power to promote his policies german chancellor merkel has said ahead of a one-day summit on monday with president sarkozy in germany that she will fully support france 's eu presidency next month despite ongoing differences . merkel told daily straubinger tagblatt ahead of a franco-german summit monday that sarkozy could count on berlin 's help on thorny issues such as climate protection and european union institutional reforms during paris ' six-month stint at the helm . " germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 09.06.2008 victory over poland ends germany 's euro drought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german to shoot a a winning euro game goal was oliver bierhoff , in 1996 germany 's 2:0 win over poland ended a 12-year drought , giving the country its first euro match victory since 1996 . the last time germany won a european championship game was way back in june 30 1996 , when oliver bierhoff placed the “ golden goal ” to beat the czech republic at london 's wembley stadium .
by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi 's rejoicing was low-key after goals on poland " poldi " was the only german player to take a victory lap in a red poland shirt , that of opponent mariusz lewandowski .
the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .
many now say the team is at their peak for euro 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 09.06.2008 victory over poland ends germany 's euro drought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german to shoot a a winning euro game goal was oliver bierhoff , in 1996 germany 's 2:0 win over poland ended a 12-year drought , giving the country its first euro match victory since 1996 . the last time germany won a european championship game was way back in june 30 1996 , when oliver bierhoff placed the “ golden goal ” to beat the czech republic at london 's wembley stadium .
by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi 's rejoicing was low-key after goals on poland " poldi " was the only german player to take a victory lap in a red poland shirt , that of opponent mariusz lewandowski .
the match was preceded by some media controversy .
last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had reason to rejoice in all , the win gave hope to germany fans , who saw proof that their team was strong , and who want to see the country go all the way to the 2008 final , after only making it to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup .
many now say the team is at their peak for euro 2008 .

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .
" joachim loew clearly has managed to get the team perfectly fit in the last three weeks , ” wrote german soccer lion franz beckenbauer in his column in the bild zeitung on monday , june 9 . “ in this combination , we don ’ t have to fear any opponent , ” he continued . " perfect start " to the tournament beckenbauer wrote that the germany-poland game was the best of the tournament so far , and the “ perfect start ” to the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beenhakker regretted the bad taste of the press klaus allofs , the general manager of the werder bremen club , praised the team , saying its impressive win was “ doubly good - not only did they win , they played well . ” both men said germany had showed they had what it takes to win the tournament . horst heldt , the sport director of vfb stuttgart , said he was impressed by the aggressive play of the germans .
“ they left no question as to who the man of the house was , ” he commented . a member of the last winning euro team from 1996 was also full of praise . " it was an amazing performance , and incredibly important for the tournament , “ said christian ziege , who is currently the sport director of borussia moenchengladbach . poland has yet to win against germany germany 's win over poland should not have come as a surprise to anyone , however .
in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .
loew said no apology was necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi greeted his polish fans even after the 2:0 win the first goal , scored just after 20 minutes , was also disputed .
beenhakker complained the goal was a “ killer ” to his team 's morale because it was unclear as to whether or not the ball was offside .
instant replay showed the ball appeared , indeed , to be marginally offside .
but the call went to germany nonetheless .
hope for germany fans " we are very disappointed .
we started the match well ... the goal they got was a killer especially because when it is a clear goal then generally you can accept it and go on . "
" if you have doubts about the goal then you feel it as a team and you take a bit of time to get over this moment and start again , " he added .

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

in an interview with german newspaper die welt , spidla noted that the average wage gap across the eu shows women earning 15 percent less than men .
the fewer the women in the work force , the lower the average wage , he noted .
the commissioner called for more compatibility between work and family , and for more women in leadership positions .
he also called on business to pay equal wages for equal work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's spidla has addressed wage-gap woes in the past " i call upon employers to really apply the principle of equal pay for equal work , ” spidla said , adding that employers have a “ key role ” in fighting an unjustifiable wage gap in the eu .
it is “ important that they stick to the relevant rules and regulations , ” he said . a question of ethics - and productivity closing the wage gap is more than just a question of ethics , spidla said .
in the end , fair pay increases worker motivation and productivity .
commission studies show that women in the eu are increasingly active in the work force . from 2000 to 2006 some 7.5 million more women have entered the work force , compared with 4.5 million men .
but one out of three women only works part time , compared with every twelfth man , spidla noted .
working part time can be a personal choice for many women , he said .
but he added that the “ real reason many women work part time is that they have less time than men , because they are busy with raising children or taking care of relatives . ”
correlation between parenting , job hours in the eu , only 62 percent of women with children are in the work force , compared with 91 percent of men with children .
“ being a parent puts constant pressure on the employment rate of women , whereas it does not affect that of men at all .
that is no longer acceptable , ” spindla said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .
saxony will hold state elections in autumn of next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift the berlin airlift in numbers berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport history -pipe- 09.06.2008 the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied planes in west berlin during the soviet blockade brought chocolate and hopes .
president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .
defense and immigration top sarkozy 's eu issues sarkozy recently announced france 's priorities for its eu presidency putting the emphasis on the creation of a stronger immigration and european defense policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's immigration policy colors sarkozy 's view for europe sarkozy said he would focus on establishing a european accord on immigration and asylum as well as a defense policy with a role which would be different from nato .
" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all . " we have managed to solve all the problems that have arisen and make progress , " merkel said . " the mediterranean union is a good example of how we have managed to make good use of the franco-german motor in the interest of the eu .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "
" i 'd be delighted if we would have an america like that , an america that wants to tackle those problems , " he said .
obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .

by ending its euro slump , the german national team earned itself a heap of praise from various quarters .

in the 75 years the two teams have been facing off , germany has won 12 times and conceded four draws .
poland has yet to score a single victory .
ironically , the winning goals in sunday 's match were scored by polish-born german player lukas podolski .
he was clearly pleased by his success , but avoided strutting over his well-placed goals in deference to his heritage , and the large family he still has in poland .
“ i have a big family -lrb- in poland -rrb- , you have to show respect , ” the 23-year-old podolski told the press after the match , as he went into the stands and greeted famil and friends who ahad travelled to austria , where the match was playsed , from his hometown of gleiwitz , poland .

last wednesday , june 4 , polish tabloid super express printed a mocked up picture of poland coach leo beenhakker holding the severed heads of german coach joachim loew and germany captain michael ballack .
both sides played down the episode , with beenhakker apologizing “ in the name of all poles ” for the tasteless boulevard press mock-up .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "
" i 'd be delighted if we would have an america like that , an america that wants to tackle those problems , " he said .
obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.06.2008 merkel 's conservatives advocate return to nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could nuclear energy at a time of record oil prices be a vote-getter ?
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?

" germany will support the french eu presidency with all its resources just as nicolas sarkozy backed our presidency " of the eu in the first half of 2007 , she said . foreign , defense , economy and environment ministers from both sides are to be present at the meeting in the eastern bavarian town for a joint ministerial council of the two dominant eu powers . the meetings , which first began in 2003 , take place twice a year . energy , including the soaring prices of oil and gas , and global warming are high on the agenda for the meeting , that comes three weeks before france takes over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency from slovenia . the meeting comes a day before us president george w bush arrives for an eu-us summit in the slovenian resort of brdo , where iran 's nuclear ambitions , russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe and divisions over visa-free travel are set to rank high . the french eu presidency is expected to push through binding rules for the 27 member states to implement ambitious eu greenhouse gas emission targets .
at odds over co2 levels in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers are divided over co2 levels in the eu france and germany are in dispute over limits for the vehicle sector , with germany pressing for its auto industry to be able to continue producing luxury vehicles with high fuel consumption and emissions .
berlin opposes the plans as vehicles made by german firms like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to be larger , luxury vehicles with greater emissions . france backs the legislation as french carmakers such as peugeot and renault tend to build smaller cars that pollute less . a german government spokesman said friday that berlin did not expect to resolve the issue at monday 's summit because negotiations are still going on . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , aims to force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams a kilometer across the range they produce by 2012 , putting german carmakers at a disadvantage to their french and italian competitors making economy cars .
one of france 's aims is to extend a defense and security pact agreed with germany in 1988 , when a german-french brigade was set up , to an eu-wide agreement .

" we can not have a common area of free movement of men and women and have 27 national policies on this issue , " sarkozy last week during his european tour before taking over the rotating presidency .
on the issue of establishing a european defense policy , sarkozy said the european union must be in a position to defend itself but said the bloc would not act as a threat to nato .
" it is not a case nor will it ever be a case of competing with nato , " he said , adding , " we need both , a nato and european defense that oppose each other makes no sense . "
turkey unlikely to enjoy much progress under french bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is likely to see little progress during france 's term in reference to europe 's relations with aspiring member turkey , sarkozy said that while france supports a close association with the country , he remained wary of allowing a poor and predominantly muslim nation into the eu .
" i am convinced that an association , as close as possible , is the best response for europe and for turkey .
i know that others envisage a different response and i respect that , " he said , adding , " i want to affirm here that during its presidency , france will behave as the loyal and impartial spokesman of the 27 member states . "
in the interview , merkel cited the lisbon treaty to reform eu decision-making and sarkozy 's plans for a mediterranean union to improve links between the eu and southern mediterranean rim states as areas where germany was willing to lend a hand . the lisbon treaty has to be agreed by all eu member states , with ireland the only member putting it to a referendum this week . germany was initially angered by the mediterranean union proposal because it excluded some eu members but managed to convince sarkozy to open it up to all .

uwe mueller , lufthansa 's asia pacific vice president , said the airline was " in good shape " despite runaway oil prices , news agency afp reported .

lufthansa recently added nanjing in china and pune in india to its network , he said .

there is no plan at the moment of reducing or cutting down , " mueller said .

after most of the votes had been counted , the largest party was chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with 39.5 percent of the vote .
that means that 123 of the 282 mayors elected are likely to be from the cdu . the new left party , formed last year as the successor to the pds , which in turn grew out of the communist party that ruled east germany until reunification in 1990 , was second with 18.7 percent .
independent voter associations were likely to get 12.1 percent , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the main german left-of-centre party , secured 11.5 percent and the liberal free market fdp 8.3 percent .
the npd is ostracized by all the main parties and there have been attempts to have it banned as unconstitutional .
a law outlawing the party was struck down by the constitutional court in 2003 .
according to initial figures , voter turnout was a relatively low 45.8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters , the lowest ever in the state .
final results were expected later on monday .

" " i 'd like to say very openly that i really do hope that he wins , " beck said after a speech in the eastern german town of erfurt .
beck 's remarks were also a tacit criticism of current us environmental policies .
he called for an america " that does n't veto social and ecological programs or does not support them . "
" i 'd be delighted if we would have an america like that , an america that wants to tackle those problems , " he said .
obama backing comes at crucial time for spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's party is suffering in the polls the disregard shown by beck - who is the spd candidate for the german chancellery - of germany 's general post-war silence on foreign political commentary has come at a time when he trails conservative chancellor angela merkel in national opinion polls .
with the spd as a whole registering at an historic low of 20 percent in polls , beck 's comments may be aimed at regaining some of this lost ground by tapping in to the stream of western european support for an obama presidency .
a recent poll conducted by angus reid global monitor found that 67 percent of respondents in germany would vote for barack obama if they participated in the upcoming us presidential election .
in a recent interview with dw-world.de , former us ambassador to germany john kornblum commented that obama 's european appeal likely arises from the image he projects as a fresh , new leader .

german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian bloc has come out firmly in favor of a return to nuclear power , seeing a vote-getter ahead of federal elections due in 15 months . although merkel has long championed a three-way mix in electrical power generation - fossil , renewables and nuclear - she has in the past been cautious in openly advocating a reverse in official government policy to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
that all changed at a top-level weekend meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , in the bavarian town of erding .
the anti-nuclear decision , passed into law by the government of her social democrat predecessor gerhard schroeder , was " absolutely wrong , " merkel said as the meeting ended monday .
prices at the pump affect voters energy is moving up the priority scale of german voters .
one issue is price .
car fuel prices , whether diesel or petrol , surged through 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.40 -rrb- a liter this spring , drawing a growl of anger from motorists and their organizations .
this weekend , a junior government minister suggested natural gas prices could surge 40 per cent in the autumn , over and above a 25-per-cent hike already announced .
most germans heat their homes with natural gas .
even though it was immediately denied , the announcement by environment ministry state-secretary michael mueller sparked alarm .
germans concerned over dependency on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends largely on russian energy another issue is energy security .
the german public is increasingly aware - and nervous - of the country 's dependence on russian energy .
in 2007 , germany imported a third of its oil and gas from russia , and the figure is set to rise when the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea goes onstream in 2011 .
a third issue is environmental concern .
merkel has made sure that climate change has remained in the spotlight .
the chancellor pushed it to the top of the agenda during germany 's presidencies of the group of eight and the european union last year , as well as making a highly publicized trip to ilulissat in greenland to view the dwindling jakobshavn glacier .
joining the bandwagon ?
germany would not be alone in reversing an anti-nuclear policy .
last month , newly elected italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a return to nuclear power , rescinding a decision dating back to 1987 , when italians voted to phase out nuclear power just a year after the chernobyl accident .
sentiment in other anti-nuclear countries , such as sweden and belgium , is also changing in the light of indications that they can not both generate the electricity needed and meet their emission targets under the kyoto protocol without nuclear power .
the small baltic states are working on a plan to build a nuclear power station to cut their dependence on russia .
widespread change in attitude a sea change is taking place in european attitudes to nuclear power , as memories of chernobyl and the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states fade .
these factors lend support to merkel 's desire to reverse the decision taken by the previous spd-greens coalition to run down the nuclear sector .
her scepticism is well known .
addressing parliament in the annual budget debate in november , traditionally an opportunity for the chancellor to take stock , she called for a " sensible course " on energy generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been vocal about the threat of global warming she predicted " problems " in attempting to reconcile the twin demands of no new coal-fired power stations and a simultaneous phase- out of nuclear power .
in terms of the law passed in 2000 , neckarwestheim 2 , which went online in 1988 as the newest of germany 's nuclear plants , should be shut by 2021 .
cdu craves independence that decision is an explicit part of the coalition deal hammered out between merkel and her spd coalition partners , and the spd is sticking firmly to it , making a change of course in the current legislative session all but impossible .
merkel would like nothing better than to shed her awkward coalition partner following the september 2009 elections and revert to the traditional centre-right arrangement with the minority fdp .
the liberal fdp , with around 13 per cent of the vote according to a recent poll , also backs reversing the nuclear phase-out .
by contrast , the spd , under pressure from the socialist left party , has declined to around 24 percent support in the national opinion polls .
the cdu / csu , on 34 percent , clearly believes it is onto a vote- winner that could help push it to a majority with the fdp , 15 months ahead of the elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german soccer monarch beckenbauer hailed this year 's euro the perfect opportunity for lehmann , 38 , to cede his position in between the german goals to one of the country 's up-and-coming prospects .
" such a tournament is always an opportunity to quit and to allow a new era to start , " said beckenbauer .
" i would tell jens to retire after euro to give younger men a chance to play .
talented keepers in lehmann 's shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is definitely one for the future lehmann has been germany 's first choice goalie since 2006 , when he assumed the mantle from oliver kahn .
he has not yet spoken about his national team future after this year 's euro .
standing in lehmann 's shadow are hanover 's robert enke , 30 , and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , who are both members of germany 's current euro squad .
soccer analysts have touted adler as the most promising german keeper in the bundesliga and a likely heir to the latter 's throne .
adler finished fifth in bundesliga 2007-08 player of the year awards behind luca toni and franck ribery of bayern munich , werder bremen playmaker diego and vfb stuttgart 's mario gomez .
meanwhile , enke , who made his bundesliga debut 10 years ago with borussia moenchengladbach , has been made to wait considerably longer for his chance to guard germany 's goals .
with more experience than his younger rival , enke stakes his own credible claim to follow on from lehmann , whom beckenbauer doubted would " still be ambitious to play in goal -lrb- at the world cup -rrb- in 2010 . "
lehmann has recently signed a one-year deal for next season with stuttgart after plying his trade with england 's arsenal for the last five years . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president bush 's visit to berlin marks 60 years of the berlin airlift .
dw-world.de spoke to a berliner who lived through the blockade , a us pilot who flew into west berlin and the author of the candy bombers . at the end of world war ii , a defeated germany had been divided into the allied occupied zones in the west and the soviet zone in the east .
berlin had also been similarly carved up into western and eastern sectors with the former capital of the third reich geographically inside the soviet zone . in june 1948 , the soviets blockaded berlin , cutting all surface routes into the besieged city .
however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however an earlier air traffic agreement between the allies and the soviet union had guaranteed that american and british jets could fly the three corridors from hamburg , bueckeburg and frankfurt into west berlin . for 15 months , the allies had flown in more than 2.3 million tons of food , coal and other necessities in the most massive humanitarian operation of all time . dw-world.de spoke to traute grier , 76 , a native berliner who had lived near the us tempelhof air base through the harsh period of the blockade , john dear , a veteran 90 year old us air force pilot who flew 150 missions into west berlin , and andrei cherny , author of the recently published book the candy bombers : the untold story of the berlin airlift and america 's finest hour . dw-world.de : frau grier , what was the immediate post-war period like for you as a kid in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are so thankful for what they did for us " traute grier : things started getting bad in april 1945 when the “ dear russians ” came .
we berliners were terrified of them .
they were savages - they raped the women and pillaged what was left of our burnt out city . once i was so desperate for food that i stole potatoes from the countryside .
when the remains of germany were carved into zones after the war , we used to say the russians got the agriculture , the british got the heavy industry and the americans got the scenery .
the russians had the food supplies , the coal , the fuel - and they took everything away from us . what did you eat ? grier : we had potatoes with watery soup , bread with mustard .
we pulled weeds from a garden to make spinach . then the americans came and gave us brown sugar and cornmeal .
germans never eat the stuff so we didn ’ t know what to do with it , but we got creative . the worst was when it was dark .
we didn ’ t have electricity for hours at a time and even candles were rationed .
and it was freezing .
the berlin winter was so harsh that we demolished chairs for firewood . what were the americans like ? grier : they were civilized people .
i was so lucky to live in the neukoelln section of berlin , near tempelhof airport in the us zone .
we used to watch the planes from the rooftops of buildings around templehof . everyone knew about the candy bomber -lrb- lt. gail “ hal ” halvorsen , a us army pilot who dropped chocolate , chewing gum and other sweets in little hand-made parachutes from his plane for the children of berlin -rrb- .
i was one of those rare kids who didn ’ t have a sweet tooth , but the gesture meant so much to us . in 1947 , we found out in school that the russians wanted to control all of berlin .
then in 1948 , we had the currency reform and the allies were getting ready to introduce the d-mark .
the russians felt so threatened by it that they cut off all road , rail and canal links into west berlin a few days later .
they even wanted to control the three air corridors leading into berlin , but general clay stood up to them .
-lrb- gen. lucius clay was military governor of the us occupational zone , who had ordered the airlift -rrb- . mr. dear , you were among the first group of pilots called up in june 1948 .
what was the airlift like ? bildunterschrift : the berlin airlift was the most massive humanitarian feat of all time in duration and number of missions flown . john dear : the weather was terrible most of the time , so visibility was often bad , especially at night .
our c-54 jets -lrb- four-engine aircraft capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo -rrb- were too big for the runway at tempelhof , so we had to come in real low to land .
our wheels even scrapped the rooftops of buildings around templehof . one pilot ahead of me was coming in too fast and crashed into an apartment building .
i had to land quickly and after 20 minutes , which was barely enough time to get a cup of coffee from the red cross , i had to fly back . the flights had to be synchronized with such precision , since planes were landing and taking off ‘ round the clock , every 90 seconds , non-stop .
if we missed our landing approach the first time , there were no second chances - we had to turn back and come out again . it would have too dangerous to circle in the clouds , with so many planes up there . was there any fear of flying accidently into soviet airspace ? dear : we had to fly within a 20 mile -lrb- 32 kilometer -rrb- wide corridor and we made sure we didn ’ t divert from those limits .
the soviets were sometimes flying alongside us and could have shot us down .
i saw one plane being escorted down by them . mr. cherny , was the berlin airlift the biggest humanitarian effort ever ?
what was the casualty rate like for the pilots ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate bars were dropped from the air in tiny parachutes andrei cherny : other missions -lrb- tsunami and other disaster relief -rrb- might have carried more tonnage , but that ’ s only because we have more cargo capacity in planes today .
the berlin airlift was certainly the biggest operation of its kind in duration and the number of missions flown .
it was a great feat of organization and the casualty rate was even lower than the entire us air force as a whole at the time , which is very low considering the scale of the operation -lrb- 277,569 allied missions from june 1948 to september 1949 -rrb- . what would have happened had the allies acted with less resolve ? cherny : if the us had withdrawn and west berlin had fallen to the soviets , the germans in the western occupied zones would have concluded that they couldn ’ t rely on us security .
france and italy were on the brink of a communist takeover - they could have fallen , so we would have seen a chain reaction in western europe . in 1948 , us president harry truman was facing re-election .
was the airlift an act of pure kindness or were there political motives involved ? cherny : both .
this was a case of a genuine humanitarian mission combined with political objectives for truman personally and the united states .
the airlift represented the struggle between the soviets and the us .
eastern europe was falling into the soviet sphere .
the us didn ’ t want another country to go , particularly one partially under its control .
it would have been a huge black mark on truman ’ s political standing , had the americans “ lost ” germany . was there more to the airlift than just providing food and sustenance to starving west berliners ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gail " hal " halvorsen was known to berliners as the " candy bomber " cherny : yes , the blockade and the airlift response to it were the turning point of when germans came around to not just accepting democracy , but to embrace its principles .
at the end of the war from 1945-1948 , polls showed that the majority of germans preferred economic security and a full stomach over freedom of speech and the right to vote .
the soviets said we ’ ll give you food as long as you sign a pledge of loyalty to us when you get your ration cards .
then in august 1948 -lrb- when the airlift had been in operation for two months -rrb- , only 4 percent of west berliners had signed up . what does this say about the west berliners ? cherny : that democracy was no longer just an abstract principle to them , that this was something they valued . grier : the americans , british and french were our enemies during the war , but in peacetime it was incredible what they did for us germans .
they were so steadfast in not letting us starve .
there were pilots who sacrificed their lives to make sure we were fed , and we are so thankful for what they did for us . the allies instilled democracy in germany .
can the us do this in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport in berlin will close in october this year cherny : that ’ s hard to see right now , but the lesson to be learned from the airlift , shows that one can bring democracy to a place viewed as being culturally and historically unsuited for it .
i read old press accounts after wwii .
there were so many commentaries about the germans being a bunch of huns , an authoritarian teutonic people , incapable of accepting democracy . so what was it that allowed democracy to take root in germany ? cherny : it was a sense of faith in humanity - germans and allies working together as equals in pursuit of a common endeavour . what made you write this book ? cherny : four or five years ago , world opinion of the us was at such a low point , it made me think : when were we americans held in the highest esteem ?
when did people respect us and understand what we stood for ?
that question led me to look at the berlin airlift .
i felt there was an untold story - about the psychological dimension of what happened .
the transformative power of what we did back then had not been told . the soviets lifted the blockade on may 11 , 1949 .
the federal republic of germany was founded on may 23 , 1949 from the three allied zones .
the german democratic republic was created from the soviet zone several months later , and was dissolved in 1990 when germany was reunified . interviews : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

published to mark carers ' week , the survey suggests those in that role may be putting their own health at risk by ignoring symptoms .
the survey also highlights the effect that caring can have on the physical and emotional wellbeing of carers .
more than 340,000 people in wales are thought to be carers , said the charity .
among the survey 's findings were that 79 % of carers in wales say their health had deteriorated due to their responsibilities and 89 % said they had been unable to cope with their day to day caring duties due to exhaustion , anxiety or fatigue .
the survey also found that 41 % frequently cover up health problems and a further 20 % say they constantly hide their illness .
more than half of those questioned said health problems had affected their ability to care .

published to mark carers ' week , the survey suggests those in that role may be putting their own health at risk by ignoring symptoms .
the survey also highlights the effect that caring can have on the physical and emotional wellbeing of carers .
more than 340,000 people in wales are thought to be carers , said the charity .
among the survey 's findings were that 79 % of carers in wales say their health had deteriorated due to their responsibilities and 89 % said they had been unable to cope with their day to day caring duties due to exhaustion , anxiety or fatigue .
the survey also found that 41 % frequently cover up health problems and a further 20 % say they constantly hide their illness .
more than half of those questioned said health problems had affected their ability to care . "
it 's a 24-hr a day job , in the end you mistreat yourself because you are so focussed on your partner " thomas reynolds , who cares for his wife thomas reynolds , 72 , from pontypool has been looking after his wife evelyn for 15 years .
she suffers from a combination of illnesses , rheumatism and arthritis and he must help her with dressing , washing and getting her around .
" it 's a stressful life , you can not go out on your own , " he said .
" everything i do i have to allow 30 minutes more , as i have to get my wife ready too .
" i had a mini stroke recently , and my doctor said it was a direct result of stress .
it 's a 24-hr a day job .
in the end you mistreat yourself because you are so focussed on your partner . "
mother-of-two susan jones from swansea , developed high blood pressure while looking after her husband wyn who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer four years ago .
she also looked after her sons alun and rhys , who were nine and 11 at the time because many of her family were too ill to help her . "
with the right support , caring should n't have to be a demoralising and stressful experience " paul matz , carers week manager " you just get on with it , you find this adrenalin that takes over and you do it , " she said .
" lack of sleep was a big factor .
i would be up at night looking after wyn , sometimes holding his sides while he was being sick .
" then i had to get carry on in the day , get the boys ready for school , wait for the nurse , look after wyn . "
macmillan cancer support in wales said it offered a range of services to help the family and friends of those affected by cancer including respite schemes .
paul matz , carers week manager said he was not surprised by the findings of the survey and called on health professionals to recognise the needs of people who are caring for others .
" with the right support , caring should n't have to be a demoralising and stressful experience , " he said .
" it can be rewarding and fulfilling - but only if carers themselves are feeling mentally and physically well . "

kathleen marshall has highlighted her concerns in a report to the united nations on children 's rights she also said family support agencies were struggling to cope with alcohol and drug abuse among young people .
the report added that improvements had been made since 2002 - but she warned some areas had become " worse " for the country 's one million children .
the report , published on monday , will be handed to the un committee on the rights of the child in geneva .
the work was carried out jointly by commissioners in scotland , wales , northern ireland and england .
in addition , prof marshall said an unhealthy climate was holding back children 's development - citing the " mosquito " device , intended to keep teenagers away by emitting a noise only they can hear .
she said : " in particular , we still lock up too many young people aged 16 and 17 in scottish prisons .
" there is a widespread fear of contact with children and young people in scotland , borne out by our own research , which has created an unhealthy climate that limits opportunities for play and leisure and hampers healthy development .
" scotland 's health record continues to be appalling and although there are now some government strategies to address this , much remains to be done . "
she said alcohol and drug abuse had a " serious impact " on young people , warning that " family support systems are finding it difficult to cope " .
prof marshall said scotland was leading the way in juvenile justice and the treatment of young asylum seekers .
she said : " in scotland we 're getting some things right .
" our separate legal system has meant that we 've been able to develop a different - and better - approach compared to the rest of the uk on some issues such as juvenile justice , through the children 's hearing system . "
she added : " the scottish government has spoken out against unacceptable methods of forced removal of children and set a lead in allowing asylum seekers access to further or higher education .
" this is something we 'd like to see implemented uk-wide . "
culture of fear the report found common problems across the uk , including a gulf between treatment of rich and poor families .
it also highlighted the " failure " to ban the physical punishment of children .
children 's minister adam ingram said the report was " very helpful " in highlighting problems that had to be addressed .
he told bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme : " we are failing too many of our children in scotland , we have endemic poverty which is affecting one in four , one in five , of our children .
" and we seem to have engendered a culture of fear - fear that children may be harmed on the one hand , and a fear of children and offending behaviour on the other . "
but he said matters had to be kept in proportion and the extent of offending behaviour was not as great as was made out .
he agreed with the report that too many 16 and 17 year olds were locked up .
mr ingram said justice minister kenny macaskill had acted to stop the practice of remanding youngsters in prisons and the children 's hearing system was also being scrutinised .
the uk is obliged to submit progress reports since signing up to the un convention in 1992 .
un representatives will visit the uk to see for themselves the evidence outlined in the report .
a final report - due in autumn - will assess how the uk is coping and set out recommendations for future action .

kathleen marshall has highlighted her concerns in a report to the united nations on children 's rights she also said family support agencies were struggling to cope with alcohol and drug abuse among young people .
the report added that improvements had been made since 2002 - but she warned some areas had become " worse " for the country 's one million children .
the report , published on monday , will be handed to the un committee on the rights of the child in geneva .
the work was carried out jointly by commissioners in scotland , wales , northern ireland and england .
in addition , prof marshall said an unhealthy climate was holding back children 's development - citing the " mosquito " device , intended to keep teenagers away by emitting a noise only they can hear .

she said : " in particular , we still lock up too many young people aged 16 and 17 in scottish prisons .
" there is a widespread fear of contact with children and young people in scotland , borne out by our own research , which has created an unhealthy climate that limits opportunities for play and leisure and hampers healthy development .
" scotland 's health record continues to be appalling and although there are now some government strategies to address this , much remains to be done . "
she said alcohol and drug abuse had a " serious impact " on young people , warning that " family support systems are finding it difficult to cope " .
prof marshall said scotland was leading the way in juvenile justice and the treatment of young asylum seekers .
she said : " in scotland we 're getting some things right .
" our separate legal system has meant that we 've been able to develop a different - and better - approach compared to the rest of the uk on some issues such as juvenile justice , through the children 's hearing system . "
she added : " the scottish government has spoken out against unacceptable methods of forced removal of children and set a lead in allowing asylum seekers access to further or higher education .
" this is something we 'd like to see implemented uk-wide . "
culture of fear the report found common problems across the uk , including a gulf between treatment of rich and poor families .
it also highlighted the " failure " to ban the physical punishment of children .
children 's minister adam ingram said the report was " very helpful " in highlighting problems that had to be addressed .
he told bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme : " we are failing too many of our children in scotland , we have endemic poverty which is affecting one in four , one in five , of our children .
" and we seem to have engendered a culture of fear - fear that children may be harmed on the one hand , and a fear of children and offending behaviour on the other . "
but he said matters had to be kept in proportion and the extent of offending behaviour was not as great as was made out .
he agreed with the report that too many 16 and 17 year olds were locked up .
mr ingram said justice minister kenny macaskill had acted to stop the practice of remanding youngsters in prisons and the children 's hearing system was also being scrutinised .
the uk is obliged to submit progress reports since signing up to the un convention in 1992 .
un representatives will visit the uk to see for themselves the evidence outlined in the report .
a final report - due in autumn - will assess how the uk is coping and set out recommendations for future action .

jolly stainesby , of south devon , spent the night under a tarpaulin , observed by the occupants of three police cars .
mr stainesby began the protest at the minister 's house in herne hill , south london , on sunday with mark harris - who later came down and was arrested .
ms harman has decided to leave her home until the protest ended .
mr stainesby said the rooftop protest could go on for some time .
speaking earlier , he said : " i 'm not coming down until they free my mate mark .
he is still being held . "
mr harris was held on suspicion of criminal damage , causing a public nuisance and other offences .
the campaigners , who are dressed as mythical superheroes " captain conception " and " cash gordon " , had said they intended to remain at the property until the former minister of justice read mr harris 's book , family court hell .
they also unfurled a banner reading : " a father is for life , not just conception " .
' direct action ' ms harman , who is also secretary of state for equalities and minister for women , said the men had not requested a meeting .
fathers 4 justice founder matt o 'connor said the government had " refused all dialogue with f4j for the past two years " and the group would now resume " a full-scale campaign of direct action against the government , its ministers and the judiciary " .
a ministry of justice spokesman said the government had carried out a public consultation on improving the openness of family courts .
he added : " this is an important and complex area of policy about which people have strong views .

jolly stainesby , of south devon , spent the night under a tarpaulin , observed by the occupants of three police cars .
mr stainesby began the protest at the minister 's house in herne hill , south london , on sunday with mark harris - who later came down and was arrested .
ms harman has decided to leave her home until the protest ended .
mr stainesby said the rooftop protest could go on for some time .
speaking earlier , he said : " i 'm not coming down until they free my mate mark .
he is still being held . "
mr harris was held on suspicion of criminal damage , causing a public nuisance and other offences .
the campaigners , who are dressed as mythical superheroes " captain conception " and " cash gordon " , had said they intended to remain at the property until the former minister of justice read mr harris 's book , family court hell .
they also unfurled a banner reading : " a father is for life , not just conception " .
' direct action ' ms harman , who is also secretary of state for equalities and minister for women , said the men had not requested a meeting .
fathers 4 justice founder matt o 'connor said the government had " refused all dialogue with f4j for the past two years " and the group would now resume " a full-scale campaign of direct action against the government , its ministers and the judiciary " .
a ministry of justice spokesman said the government had carried out a public consultation on improving the openness of family courts .
he added : " this is an important and complex area of policy about which people have strong views .
we must ensure we get it right . "
