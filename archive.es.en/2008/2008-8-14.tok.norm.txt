" we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield , " after washington agreed to meet poland 's key demand for defense aid separate from the anti-missile system , tusk told polish news channel tvn in a live interview . " we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal . " the agreement has been reached after more than 18 months of back-and-forth , often terse , negotiations between the two countries .
its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .

" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .

us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway province of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev looked like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop / bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .
if medvedev wants to be perceived as the president both by the russian people and abroad , then putin 's protege has to show in both deeds and words that he is the most powerful man in the nation not just on paper - even if it is to the detriment of prime minister vladimir putin .

poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .
15 , responded by warning ypsilanti against relying on the left party .
mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .
" we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do . we will have to decide how to behave towards the left , " she said .
final decision in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left debuted in hesse 's state parliament this year the spd agreed to a timetable for consultations with rank-and-file members across hesse , culminating in a party conference on oct .
4 which will ultimately decide the matter .
if the party backs ypsilanti , talks with the left could then start about possible cooperation .
the move is ypsilanti 's second bid to gain power with the help of the left party after the first failed in march .
that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .
" she has gambled away her own and the hesse spd 's credibility - that is the worst thing for a politician or party , " political scientist peter loesche told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" and the national party is paying the price . "
with federal elections just a year away , the social democrats ' popularity rating has sunk to a historic low of 20 percent , according to a poll conducted by forsa .
it showed them trailing their coalition partners , the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the csu , by 17 percent .
support for the left party remained stable at 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .

condoleezza rice , meanwhile , was on her way to europe for peace negotiations over the south ossetian conflict . georgian forces have begun retaking control of gori as the russian military pulls out , interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili told afp news agency thursday , aug .
14 . the handover of the central georgian city began after a tense first day of ceasefire , with both moscow and tbilisi exchanging accusations of breaching the truce . according to reports , witnesses said that hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , which is a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov denied claims of looting , saying that his government was " investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions . " rice to hold peace talks in paris , tbilisi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice visits paris and tbilisi on thursday , but not moscow on wednesday , lavrov warned washington , a staunch ally of georgia , that it had to choose between a " relatively virtual " relationship with tbilisi and a " partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- on questions that require collective action . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice was due to arrive in paris early thursday to discuss an eu-brokered peace plan with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
both georgia and russia have tentatively agreed to the plan , which sarkozy presented in tbilisi and moscow earlier this week . rice was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however . us president bush on wednesday urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " said bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian forces are reportedly replacing russia troops in gori " the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way . saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon . the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .

we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .

tsvangirai was detained at the airport but later released .
however , his travel documents were confiscated by airport immigration officials , his spokesman george sibotshiwe told news agencies .
talks between tsvangirai and zimbabwean president robert mugabe on a power-sharing government broke down earlier this week , after the two men failed to agree on who should be head of government .
tsvangirai said in a statement that the will of the people had to be upheld , and that meant he should be president .
tsvangirai won a march poll over mugabe but boycotted a june run-off , citing violence against his supporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.08.2008 german slowdown wears on european economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recession could be looming in some eu countries the european economy shrank during the second quarter , data released thursday showed , amid worries that the region 's slowdown could gain momentum in the run-up to the end of the year . the 15-member euro zone contracted by 0.2 percent during the three months to the end of june , the european commission 's statistics office eurostat said thursday , aug .
4 .
high inflation hit consumer spending and a strong euro as well as weaker global growth undercut the currency bloc 's export machine " the euro-zone economy is on the edge of a recession , " said commerzbank economists christoph weil and michael schubert in a note to clients . the euro zone grew quarter on quarter at 0.7 percent during the first three months of the year .
the second-quarter growth rate was in line with analysts ' forecasts . at the same time , year-on-year growth in the euro zone slipped back from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.5 percent in the three months to the end of june , eurostat said . but a spokeswoman for europe 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said fears about a recession were overplayed . " the signs for the future are not very good if you look at the confidence indicators , " spokeswoman amelia torres said .
but added that " it is a bit exaggerated to use the word -lrb- recession -rrb- . " germany not as bad as expected earlier in the day the euro zone 's two biggest economies also reported a contraction in the second quarter , with the german economy shrinking by a less-than-forecast 0.5 percent after the currency bloc 's biggest economy grew at a revised 1.3 percent during the first quarter . nevertheless , it was the first fall in the german economy in almost four years . data published thursday showed economic growth in france slowing from 0.4 percent during the first quarter to a bigger-than-forecast 0.3-percent slump in the latest three months . the second-quarter contraction in france represented the first time in about five years that the economy has shrunk in the euro zone 's second biggest member . however , recently a steady stream of gloomy economic sentiment surveys and downbeat economic numbers has helped to raise concerns about the outlook for the european economy . inflation worries remain also overhanging the european economic outlook is the threat posed by high inflation . annual consumer prices posted a 4-percent gain in july , down slightly down from its preliminary 4.1-percent estimate , eurostat said . however , inflation in the euro zone remains at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " comments last week from european central bank chief jean-claude trichet that the euro-zone economy faced weak growth in the coming months resulted in the euro suffering its biggest weekly drop , pushing the common currency down to near a six-month low against the us dollar of about $ 1.50 . moreover , the slowing growth is likely to help to dampen inflationary pressures in the coming months and mean that interest rates in the euro zone will be on hold for sometime . in its monthly report released thursday , the ecb insisted that it remained focused on the threat posed by inflation . but it warned that " the uncertainty surrounding -lrb- the -rrb- outlook for economic activity remains high , owing to , among other things , the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets . " overall , downside risks prevail , " the bank 's monthly bulletin said . the ecb left its benchmark refinancing rate on hold at 4.25 percent last week . recession looming ? this also follows fears that several euro zone economies which have been hit badly by the global financial market and credit crisis - such as spain , ireland and italy - could be already sliding into recession . italy 's statistics office said last week that the euro zone 's third economy shrank by 0.3 percent quarter on quarter , resulting in zero growth on the year .
this followed a 0.4-percent slump during the first quarter . the economy in the 27-member european union slipped by 0.1 percent during the second quarter to produce a year-on-year expansion rate of 1.7 percent .
this compared to a 0.7-percent growth rate during the first three months of the year .
the eu clocked up a year-on-year expansion rate of 2.3 percent during the first quarter . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of commander-in-chief of the russian forces .

if medvedev wants to be perceived as the president both by the russian people and abroad , then putin 's protege has to show in both deeds and words that he is the most powerful man in the nation not just on paper - even if it is to the detriment of prime minister vladimir putin .

we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .

tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .

" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .
she was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however .
humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the first us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way .
saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon .
the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .
15 , responded by warning ypsilanti against relying on the left party .
mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .
" we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do . we will have to decide how to behave towards the left , " she said .
final decision in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left debuted in hesse 's state parliament this year the spd agreed to a timetable for consultations with rank-and-file members across hesse , culminating in a party conference on oct .
4 which will ultimately decide the matter .
if the party backs ypsilanti , talks with the left could then start about possible cooperation .
the move is ypsilanti 's second bid to gain power with the help of the left party after the first failed in march .
that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .
" she has gambled away her own and the hesse spd 's credibility - that is the worst thing for a politician or party , " political scientist peter loesche told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" and the national party is paying the price . "
with federal elections just a year away , the social democrats ' popularity rating has sunk to a historic low of 20 percent , according to a poll conducted by forsa .
it showed them trailing their coalition partners , the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the csu , by 17 percent .
support for the left party remained stable at 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .

mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .

that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .

the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

14 - the second day of a two-day meeting - the leaders of syria and lebanon also agreed to examine the fate of hundreds of people who have been missing since lebanon 's civil war .
the decisions came on the second day of meetings between syrian president bashar assad and his lebanese counterpart , michel suleiman , in damascus .
first visit since 2005 it was the first visit by a lebanese president to syria since the 2005 assassination of former premier rafiq hariri in beirut .
the murder , which many in lebanon blame on syria , triggered the pullout of syrian forces from lebanon after almost 30 years of military presence .
after first deciding to open diplomatic ties between the two countries , the leaders agreed to look into sticky border issues , and to examine the fate of hundreds of people who have been missing since lebanon 's civil war .
the borders between the two countries are poorly delimited in certain places , particularly the shebaa farms , a mountainous sliver of land rich in water resources located at the junction of southeast lebanon , southwest syria , and northern israel .
missing persons on the agenda the sides also discussed how to control arms trafficking , especially those intended for the lebanese shiite militant group hezbollah .
most controversial was the issue of the fate of hundreds of lebanese people who went missing in their country during the 1975-1990 civil war .

mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .

the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .

high inflation hit consumer spending and a strong euro as well as weaker global growth undercut the currency bloc 's export machine " the euro-zone economy is on the edge of a recession , " said commerzbank economists christoph weil and michael schubert in a note to clients . the euro zone grew quarter on quarter at 0.7 percent during the first three months of the year .
the second-quarter growth rate was in line with analysts ' forecasts . at the same time , year-on-year growth in the euro zone slipped back from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.5 percent in the three months to the end of june , eurostat said . but a spokeswoman for europe 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said fears about a recession were overplayed . " the signs for the future are not very good if you look at the confidence indicators , " spokeswoman amelia torres said .
but added that " it is a bit exaggerated to use the word -lrb- recession -rrb- .

" comments last week from european central bank chief jean-claude trichet that the euro-zone economy faced weak growth in the coming months resulted in the euro suffering its biggest weekly drop , pushing the common currency down to near a six-month low against the us dollar of about $ 1.50 . moreover , the slowing growth is likely to help to dampen inflationary pressures in the coming months and mean that interest rates in the euro zone will be on hold for sometime . in its monthly report released thursday , the ecb insisted that it remained focused on the threat posed by inflation . but it warned that " the uncertainty surrounding -lrb- the -rrb- outlook for economic activity remains high , owing to , among other things , the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .

we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .
as an interactive medium , the internet plays a pivotal role in the dialogue between cultures .

instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?

are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .
as an interactive medium , the internet plays a pivotal role in the dialogue between cultures .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .
as an interactive medium , the internet plays a pivotal role in the dialogue between cultures .

task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .

14 . the handover of the central georgian city began after a tense first day of ceasefire , with both moscow and tbilisi exchanging accusations of breaching the truce . according to reports , witnesses said that hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , which is a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov denied claims of looting , saying that his government was " investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions .

bush said more aid was on its way . saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon . the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

14 - the second day of a two-day meeting - the leaders of syria and lebanon also agreed to examine the fate of hundreds of people who have been missing since lebanon 's civil war .
the decisions came on the second day of meetings between syrian president bashar assad and his lebanese counterpart , michel suleiman , in damascus .
first visit since 2005 it was the first visit by a lebanese president to syria since the 2005 assassination of former premier rafiq hariri in beirut .
the murder , which many in lebanon blame on syria , triggered the pullout of syrian forces from lebanon after almost 30 years of military presence .
after first deciding to open diplomatic ties between the two countries , the leaders agreed to look into sticky border issues , and to examine the fate of hundreds of people who have been missing since lebanon 's civil war .
the borders between the two countries are poorly delimited in certain places , particularly the shebaa farms , a mountainous sliver of land rich in water resources located at the junction of southeast lebanon , southwest syria , and northern israel .
missing persons on the agenda the sides also discussed how to control arms trafficking , especially those intended for the lebanese shiite militant group hezbollah .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .

mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

if medvedev wants to be perceived as the president both by the russian people and abroad , then putin 's protege has to show in both deeds and words that he is the most powerful man in the nation not just on paper - even if it is to the detriment of prime minister vladimir putin .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .
russia says the peace agreement gives its troops a central role in the disputed areas as peacekeepers while western leaders are pressing for an international force to serve in that capacity .
the truce came under strain on wednesday after georgia said russian tanks had rolled into gori in a blatant violation of the ceasefire .
bildunterschrift : a damaged building in gori according to reports , witnesses said hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north .
russia has denied the allegations .
on thursday , the georgian interior ministry confirmed its forces had begun to take control of gori as the russian military pulled out .
tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .
russia on wednesday also said that while it would talk with the european union about the truce agreement , it refuses to deal directly with the georgian president .
" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .
russia says the peace agreement gives its troops a central role in the disputed areas as peacekeepers while western leaders are pressing for an international force to serve in that capacity .
the truce came under strain on wednesday after georgia said russian tanks had rolled into gori in a blatant violation of the ceasefire .
bildunterschrift : a damaged building in gori according to reports , witnesses said hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north .
russia has denied the allegations .
on thursday , the georgian interior ministry confirmed its forces had begun to take control of gori as the russian military pulled out .
tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .
russia on wednesday also said that while it would talk with the european union about the truce agreement , it refuses to deal directly with the georgian president .
" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .
she was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however .
humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the first us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way .
saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon .
the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

" we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield , " after washington agreed to meet poland 's key demand for defense aid separate from the anti-missile system , tusk told polish news channel tvn in a live interview . " we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal . " the agreement has been reached after more than 18 months of back-and-forth , often terse , negotiations between the two countries .
its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

" we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal .

its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .

but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .

the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

if medvedev wants to be perceived as the president both by the russian people and abroad , then putin 's protege has to show in both deeds and words that he is the most powerful man in the nation not just on paper - even if it is to the detriment of prime minister vladimir putin .

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .
russia says the peace agreement gives its troops a central role in the disputed areas as peacekeepers while western leaders are pressing for an international force to serve in that capacity .
the truce came under strain on wednesday after georgia said russian tanks had rolled into gori in a blatant violation of the ceasefire .
bildunterschrift : a damaged building in gori according to reports , witnesses said hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north .
russia has denied the allegations .
on thursday , the georgian interior ministry confirmed its forces had begun to take control of gori as the russian military pulled out .
tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .
russia on wednesday also said that while it would talk with the european union about the truce agreement , it refuses to deal directly with the georgian president .
" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .
she was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however .
humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the first us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way .
saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon .
the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .
15 , responded by warning ypsilanti against relying on the left party .
mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .
" we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do . we will have to decide how to behave towards the left , " she said .
final decision in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left debuted in hesse 's state parliament this year the spd agreed to a timetable for consultations with rank-and-file members across hesse , culminating in a party conference on oct .
4 which will ultimately decide the matter .
if the party backs ypsilanti , talks with the left could then start about possible cooperation .
the move is ypsilanti 's second bid to gain power with the help of the left party after the first failed in march .
that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .
" she has gambled away her own and the hesse spd 's credibility - that is the worst thing for a politician or party , " political scientist peter loesche told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" and the national party is paying the price . "
with federal elections just a year away , the social democrats ' popularity rating has sunk to a historic low of 20 percent , according to a poll conducted by forsa .
it showed them trailing their coalition partners , the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the csu , by 17 percent .
support for the left party remained stable at 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield , " after washington agreed to meet poland 's key demand for defense aid separate from the anti-missile system , tusk told polish news channel tvn in a live interview . " we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal . " the agreement has been reached after more than 18 months of back-and-forth , often terse , negotiations between the two countries .
its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

high inflation hit consumer spending and a strong euro as well as weaker global growth undercut the currency bloc 's export machine " the euro-zone economy is on the edge of a recession , " said commerzbank economists christoph weil and michael schubert in a note to clients . the euro zone grew quarter on quarter at 0.7 percent during the first three months of the year .
the second-quarter growth rate was in line with analysts ' forecasts . at the same time , year-on-year growth in the euro zone slipped back from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.5 percent in the three months to the end of june , eurostat said . but a spokeswoman for europe 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said fears about a recession were overplayed .

" comments last week from european central bank chief jean-claude trichet that the euro-zone economy faced weak growth in the coming months resulted in the euro suffering its biggest weekly drop , pushing the common currency down to near a six-month low against the us dollar of about $ 1.50 . moreover , the slowing growth is likely to help to dampen inflationary pressures in the coming months and mean that interest rates in the euro zone will be on hold for sometime . in its monthly report released thursday , the ecb insisted that it remained focused on the threat posed by inflation . but it warned that " the uncertainty surrounding -lrb- the -rrb- outlook for economic activity remains high , owing to , among other things , the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets . " overall , downside risks prevail , " the bank 's monthly bulletin said . the ecb left its benchmark refinancing rate on hold at 4.25 percent last week . recession looming ? this also follows fears that several euro zone economies which have been hit badly by the global financial market and credit crisis - such as spain , ireland and italy - could be already sliding into recession . italy 's statistics office said last week that the euro zone 's third economy shrank by 0.3 percent quarter on quarter , resulting in zero growth on the year .
this followed a 0.4-percent slump during the first quarter . the economy in the 27-member european union slipped by 0.1 percent during the second quarter to produce a year-on-year expansion rate of 1.7 percent .

" we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal .

its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .
" we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do . we will have to decide how to behave towards the left , " she said .
final decision in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left debuted in hesse 's state parliament this year the spd agreed to a timetable for consultations with rank-and-file members across hesse , culminating in a party conference on oct .
4 which will ultimately decide the matter .
if the party backs ypsilanti , talks with the left could then start about possible cooperation .
the move is ypsilanti 's second bid to gain power with the help of the left party after the first failed in march .
that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .
" she has gambled away her own and the hesse spd 's credibility - that is the worst thing for a politician or party , " political scientist peter loesche told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" and the national party is paying the price . "
with federal elections just a year away , the social democrats ' popularity rating has sunk to a historic low of 20 percent , according to a poll conducted by forsa .
it showed them trailing their coalition partners , the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the csu , by 17 percent .
support for the left party remained stable at 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .
russia says the peace agreement gives its troops a central role in the disputed areas as peacekeepers while western leaders are pressing for an international force to serve in that capacity .
the truce came under strain on wednesday after georgia said russian tanks had rolled into gori in a blatant violation of the ceasefire .
bildunterschrift : a damaged building in gori according to reports , witnesses said hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north .

on thursday , the georgian interior ministry confirmed its forces had begun to take control of gori as the russian military pulled out .
tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .
russia on wednesday also said that while it would talk with the european union about the truce agreement , it refuses to deal directly with the georgian president .
" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .
she was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however .
humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the first us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way .
saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon .
the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

meanwhile , diplomatic efforts continue . eduard kokoity and sergei bagapsh , self-styled presidents of south ossetia and abhkazia , respectively , held talks with russian president dimitry medvedev at the kremlin on thursday , aug .
14 , amid a diplomatic drive to forge peace between georgia and russia .
speaking after the two leaders signed a six-point peace plan brokered this week by france to end fierce fighting between georgia and russia , medvedev said moscow fully supported their position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said russia fully supported the positions of south ossetia and abkhazia on their future status " please be aware that russia 's position is unchanged .
we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia … and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world , " medvedev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .
ceasefire under strain medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili this week agreed to a peace plan drafted by french president nicolas sarkozy to end fighting in south ossetia .
however , the accord leaves unclear where russian and georgian troops are allowed to be in georgia .
russia says the peace agreement gives its troops a central role in the disputed areas as peacekeepers while western leaders are pressing for an international force to serve in that capacity .
the truce came under strain on wednesday after georgia said russian tanks had rolled into gori in a blatant violation of the ceasefire .
bildunterschrift : a damaged building in gori according to reports , witnesses said hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north .
russia has denied the allegations .
on thursday , the georgian interior ministry confirmed its forces had begun to take control of gori as the russian military pulled out .
tensions remain high however , tension remained high between russia and the west , with moscow warning washington it would have to choose between its partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia .
russia on wednesday also said that while it would talk with the european union about the truce agreement , it refuses to deal directly with the georgian president .
" we still have diplomatic relations with georgia , we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia , " russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov told bbc television .
" but we wo n't directly talk to saakashvili , we wo n't do that .
we offered him peace but not friendship . "
russia has accused georgia of violating the truce by failing to pursue an " active withdrawal " from south ossetia , where moscow says 2,000 civilians were killed in the fighting .
us steps up diplomatic efforts amid the standoff , the us stepped up diplomatic efforts to help calm the crisis .
president george w bush dispatched secretary of state , condoleeza rice to the region and urged russia to abide by the ceasefire agreement .
" to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " bush said .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically-elected government of georgia , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush flanked by rice , left , and defense secretary robert gates rice was to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , in paris on thursday .
she was to continue on from paris to the georgian capital later thursday to hold talks with president mikheil saakashvili .
she will not visit moscow , however .
humanitarian aid arrives in georgia meanwhile , the first us military plane carrying medical supplies , shelter , bedding and cots landed in tbilisi , officials said .
bush said more aid was on its way .
saakashvili said the humanitarian aid deliveries meant the us military would take control of georgian ports and airports , a claim quickly denied by the pentagon .
the georgian president also criticized the us 's initial response to the crisis , saying early statements from washington on moscow 's push into south ossetia were " too soft .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

14 . the handover of the central georgian city began after a tense first day of ceasefire , with both moscow and tbilisi exchanging accusations of breaching the truce . according to reports , witnesses said that hundreds of south ossetian rebels , accompanied by russian military personnel , torched and looted homes near gori , which is a key city linking georgia proper with the separatist south ossetian region to the north . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov denied claims of looting , saying that his government was " investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .

" we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield , " after washington agreed to meet poland 's key demand for defense aid separate from the anti-missile system , tusk told polish news channel tvn in a live interview . " we would start with a battery under us command , but made available to the polish army .
then there would be a second phase , involving equipping the polish army with missiles , " tusk added , emphasizing that negotiators had reached a " preliminary deal . " the agreement has been reached after more than 18 months of back-and-forth , often terse , negotiations between the two countries .
its conclusion carries an especially symbolic weight in the aftermath of russia 's incursion into georgia in recent days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk said poland 's demands had been met in return for agreeing to host 10 us missile interceptors on its soil , poland will receive patriot air defense missiles and increased military cooperation with the us , according to a report by poland 's pap news agency us and polish negotiators were meeting in warsaw on thursday in the latest in a series of talks that formally began in may 2007 . czech deal already complete in july , the bush administration signed a deal with the neighboring czech republic on hosting a radar base - the other part of the system to be based in the two ex-communist countries .
poland and czech republic joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 . before the latest talks in warsaw , top polish government officials said a new us proposal was on the table and that russia 's military assault on georgia had given an impetus to the missile defense talks . a key polish concern is boosting its air defenses after moscow threatened to target the planned bases in its former direct sphere of influence . russia strongly opposes the us plan , despite assurances from washington that the shield would target ballistic missile threats from countries like iran and was not meant to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent . the interfax news agency cites konstantin kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the russian lower house of parliament , as saying the agreement will spark " a real rise in tensions in russian-american relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.08.2008 opinion : south ossetia mars medvedev 's record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev was elected president 100 days ago .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he has to show more independence if he is to credibly fill this role . the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian confict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - , nevertheless , managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway republic of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of the commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev was left looking like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop " / " bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .
the conflict in south ossetia has been bad news for president medvedev , spoiling what was set to be a generally favorable evaluation of his first 100 days in office .
but more importantly , the war against georgia has undermined his position as russia 's most powerful man , on paper at least , and revealed the new dual leadership in russia , the tandemocracy with prime minister vladimir putin , as a farce .
the first 93 days … president medvedev 's first days in office were , in russian terms , very positive - at least , they were before the south ossetian conflict broke out and russian troops moved into georgia . first of all , he was able to avoid any major mistakes on the domestic stage .
it would have been fatal if he had started out by squaring up to the powerful cliques in the russian leadership elite .
secondly , medvedev had - thanks to a number of cautious statements - nevertheless managed to emancipate himself to some extent from putin and raise his own profile a little .
medvedev 's more cordial style and his liberal and europe-oriented statements went down well on his foreign trips .
the west was also pleased to learn that medvedev had stopped moves , initiated under putin 's presidency , to tighten up media laws .
and when the prime minister publicly lambasted steel and mining giant mechel and sent its share values plummeting , president medvedev cautiously expressed his opposition to the state putting companies under pressure - without , of course , mentioning putin 's name .
admittedly , these deeds can hardly be classed as acts of heroism .
but in the context of the complicated power relations in russia , they were tentative signs of independence on the new president 's part .
but then came the war in the caucasus .
the last seven days … georgia 's attempt to bring the breakaway province of south ossetia back under the control of tbilisi has significantly marred medvedev 's 100-day record .
on the first day , he seemed unprepared and he was visibly uncomfortable in the role of commander-in-chief of the russian forces .
it was then putin , in time-honored fashion , who took charge from distant beijing , underlining the move with a surprise visit to the north ossetian capital vladikavkas on saturday .
medvedev looked like a deputy left at home to pass on the orders for russia 's tough and uncompromising military response to georgia , rather than the one making the decisions .
this has wrecked medvedev 's attempts at rapprochement with europe .
when russian troops marched into georgia , it brought about a significant cooling off in relations between the west and russia .
medvedev 's liberal and europe-friendly words have almost been forgotten .
a " good cop / bad cop " act played by medvedev and putin will not work .
the message is clear both at home and abroad : putin holds the reins of power in russia .
if medvedev wants to be perceived as the president both by the russian people and abroad , then putin 's protege has to show in both deeds and words that he is the most powerful man in the nation not just on paper - even if it is to the detriment of prime minister vladimir putin .

4 .
high inflation hit consumer spending and a strong euro as well as weaker global growth undercut the currency bloc 's export machine " the euro-zone economy is on the edge of a recession , " said commerzbank economists christoph weil and michael schubert in a note to clients . the euro zone grew quarter on quarter at 0.7 percent during the first three months of the year .
the second-quarter growth rate was in line with analysts ' forecasts . at the same time , year-on-year growth in the euro zone slipped back from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.5 percent in the three months to the end of june , eurostat said . but a spokeswoman for europe 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said fears about a recession were overplayed . " the signs for the future are not very good if you look at the confidence indicators , " spokeswoman amelia torres said .
but added that " it is a bit exaggerated to use the word -lrb- recession -rrb- . " germany not as bad as expected earlier in the day the euro zone 's two biggest economies also reported a contraction in the second quarter , with the german economy shrinking by a less-than-forecast 0.5 percent after the currency bloc 's biggest economy grew at a revised 1.3 percent during the first quarter . nevertheless , it was the first fall in the german economy in almost four years . data published thursday showed economic growth in france slowing from 0.4 percent during the first quarter to a bigger-than-forecast 0.3-percent slump in the latest three months . the second-quarter contraction in france represented the first time in about five years that the economy has shrunk in the euro zone 's second biggest member . however , recently a steady stream of gloomy economic sentiment surveys and downbeat economic numbers has helped to raise concerns about the outlook for the european economy . inflation worries remain also overhanging the european economic outlook is the threat posed by high inflation . annual consumer prices posted a 4-percent gain in july , down slightly down from its preliminary 4.1-percent estimate , eurostat said . however , inflation in the euro zone remains at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " comments last week from european central bank chief jean-claude trichet that the euro-zone economy faced weak growth in the coming months resulted in the euro suffering its biggest weekly drop , pushing the common currency down to near a six-month low against the us dollar of about $ 1.50 . moreover , the slowing growth is likely to help to dampen inflationary pressures in the coming months and mean that interest rates in the euro zone will be on hold for sometime . in its monthly report released thursday , the ecb insisted that it remained focused on the threat posed by inflation . but it warned that " the uncertainty surrounding -lrb- the -rrb- outlook for economic activity remains high , owing to , among other things , the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets . " overall , downside risks prevail , " the bank 's monthly bulletin said . the ecb left its benchmark refinancing rate on hold at 4.25 percent last week . recession looming ? this also follows fears that several euro zone economies which have been hit badly by the global financial market and credit crisis - such as spain , ireland and italy - could be already sliding into recession . italy 's statistics office said last week that the euro zone 's third economy shrank by 0.3 percent quarter on quarter , resulting in zero growth on the year .
this followed a 0.4-percent slump during the first quarter . the economy in the 27-member european union slipped by 0.1 percent during the second quarter to produce a year-on-year expansion rate of 1.7 percent .
this compared to a 0.7-percent growth rate during the first three months of the year .
the eu clocked up a year-on-year expansion rate of 2.3 percent during the first quarter . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday , aug .
15 , responded by warning ypsilanti against relying on the left party .
mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .
" we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do . we will have to decide how to behave towards the left , " she said .
final decision in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left debuted in hesse 's state parliament this year the spd agreed to a timetable for consultations with rank-and-file members across hesse , culminating in a party conference on oct .
4 which will ultimately decide the matter .
if the party backs ypsilanti , talks with the left could then start about possible cooperation .
the move is ypsilanti 's second bid to gain power with the help of the left party after the first failed in march .
that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .
it also damaged spd leader kurt beck , who had signalled his assent .
beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .
" she has gambled away her own and the hesse spd 's credibility - that is the worst thing for a politician or party , " political scientist peter loesche told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" and the national party is paying the price . "
with federal elections just a year away , the social democrats ' popularity rating has sunk to a historic low of 20 percent , according to a poll conducted by forsa .
it showed them trailing their coalition partners , the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the csu , by 17 percent .
support for the left party remained stable at 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its popularity has slumped in recent months . after a meeting with top spd members in the state of hesse , regional party leader andrea ypsilanti signalled she would try to convince her party to cooperate with the left to oust conservative premier roland koch .

mistrust of left leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel has warned against cooperation many in the spd are deeply suspicious of the left - which is made up of ex-communists and disillusioned spd supporters - and feel betrayed by its populist leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd and finance minister .
" i would strongly advise against playing into the hands of lafontaine , " gabriel told the german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung .
he added that the left party leader was only trying to destabilize the spd . in hesse , the tacit support of the left for a spd and green party coalition could bring down the cdu 's minority administration .
" we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change , " ypsilanti told reporters after executive meeting .

that angered many fellow party members as she had previously vowed not to work with the left .

beck 's ratings have slumped in the last few months and german media widely report he will not fight incumbent angela merkel for the chancellorship in the september 2009 election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is being tipped as the most likely alternative .
national repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its been a challenging year for the spd analysts say ypsilanti 's fresh attempt risks damaging the spd at the national level .
the party 's left and right wings are deeply divided over what stance the spd should adopt towards the left .
this move is expected to reopen the fierce debate .

have you achieved the goals you set ? erik bettermann : many of them , yes .
together with the broadcasting board and administrative board , we drew up strategic company aims for germany 's international broadcaster in mid-2002 .
they serve as the basis for all of the reform measures taken since then - ranging from setting geopolitical focal points to the regionalization of the programmes of dw-tv , dw-radio and dw-world.de. other goals we have reached include the founding of the dw-akademie and the unanimous passing of the new deutsche welle act .
there is one thing i am not satisfied with , however , and it concerns the funding of dw .
to be honest , i had hoped that the federal government would not merely acknowledge the status of a powerful international media representative with lip service , but also that it would provide the corresponding funding .
when the federal budget increases , but our budget is once again reduced , that 's a disappointment for me .
chronic under-funding of dw has led to structural problems .
yet , i am optimistic that the new deutsche welle act and our recent initial task plan of the new kind will lead to an intense discussion with politicians on the financial demands of the international broadcaster .
question : you described the new deutsche welle act - that has been in force since 1 january 2005 - as a " milestone . "
are you now the director-general of a completely new deutsche welle ?
bildunterschrift : erik bettermann bettermann : no , but of a deutsche welle that is enjoying renewed awareness and esteem from politics and the public .
in fact , the act has created some important new bases for action .
on the other hand , it also verifies many things that dw has already begun or long carried through under the influence of changing international circumstances and the drastically reduced budget .
in particular , the very transparent procedure for task planning and evaluation offers us new possibilities , combined with fundamental planning security over a period of four years .
we can therefore react more flexibly to global political challenges , set focal points and plan more reliably .
the programme mission has now been considerably broadened and largely aligned to a contemporary grasp of the work of an international broadcaster .
in addition , the legal affirmation of dw-world.de as dw 's third media pillar was long overdue ten years after the launch of the online service .
question : the new programme mission states the objective of " promoting understanding and dialogue between cultures and peoples . "
that sounds like a noble claim .
bettermann : perhaps , but it 's part of our everyday work and by no means new .
for five decades , dw has worked in many ways towards promoting understanding and dialogue between peoples and cultures .
the reliable journalism of our staff from over 60 nations states as much .
in our broadcasting regions , we have earned the reputation of honest mediators .
take afghanistan , for example : dw-radio has operated a service in dari and pashto there since 1969 .
we are a well-known and highly regarded brand there .
that is also one of the main reasons that our tv work for afghanistan , which we launched in august 2002 , is so successful .
today , this service , also in dari and pashto , is used by stations in all of the nation 's provinces .
furthermore , the courses offered by the dw-akademie for journalists , technicians and managers support the reconstruction of the afghan media system .
every day we fulfil the directives of the deutsche welle act to promote cultural exchange with these and many other activities that bring people from germany and from our broadcasting regions together .
international broadcasting can only work well if it is designed for dialogue .
question : does n't the new procedure for task planning and evaluation encroach upon deutsche welle 's autonomy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik bettermann mit schlüssel dw deutsche welle , bonn bettermann : no , not at all .
task planning does not involve debating with the parliament about our core business of journalism , so we do not discuss programme content .
instead , it is a matter of gaining clarity on focal point goals and other strategic considerations .
in view of the reduced budget , we need to talk about priorities in the distribution of services .
less and less money means we will not be able to continue to offer our international services to the same extent as before .
self-regulation and task planning , as envisioned in the new law , ensure a high degree of dialogue and transparency while also guaranteeing the full autonomy of dw .
the result strengthens broadcasting freedom .
the new procedure gives us the option of implementing the broadly worded programme mission in very concrete measures .
it is very important for the development potential of dw that the act ensures a higher degree of planning security for the medium term .
now , dw can set its own focal points in its task planning - taking the positions of the parliament , federal government and interested public into consideration .
task planning is secured by the four-year planning period , the medium-term fiscal plans of the federal government and the decisions of the budgetary legislators .
question : in return for more planning security - so we 've heard - dw will be " required " to offer a comprehensive range of online services ...
bettermann : we 're doing that already .
it 's correct that the new act confirms that dw-world.de is an independent media pillar of dw .
this is good because dw-world.de is one of the most modern websites - with services in 30 languages .
here , users can find reports on politics , business , the arts and everything they are interested in knowing with a focus on germany and europe .
we do n't merely offer news , but analysis as well .
as an interactive medium , the internet plays a pivotal role in the dialogue between cultures .

speaking on the eve of pakistan 's independence day , mr musharraf said : " differences should be buried . "
his comments came amid increasing pressure on him from the ruling coalition to step down or face charges of corruption and abuse of power .
mr musharraf has clung to power despite the defeat of his allies in elections .
" i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country , " mr musharraf said in a tv address ahead of thursday 's independence day celebrations . "
pakistan is going through a difficult phase of its history " president pervez musharraf he said pakistan was passing through a " difficult phase in its history " .
" our adversaries are trying to destabilise pakistan from several fronts , internal as well as external . "
mr musharraf said the country 's defence forces were " stronger than ever before " .
uphill battle the president 's comments came on a day when the assembly in the province of sindh passed a resolution calling on him to take a vote of confidence or resign .
the vote follows similar resolutions by the punjab and north west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- assemblies .
the bbc 's chris morris in islamabad says that in public , president musharraf 's supporters are defiant but behind the scenes there are negotiations about a dignified exit .
our correspondent says that he could pre-empt impeachment by resigning in the next few days or he could answer the charges brought against him in parliament first .
but our correspondent says the numbers do not look good for the man often described by president bush as a key ally in the american-led war on terror .
" he has two options : to stay and fight or quit and go home , " mushahid hussain , secretary-general of the former ruling pml-q party which supports mr musharraf told the associated press news agency .
" if he fights back we are with him .
we will support him , and that is the preferred option . "
an impeachment would take pakistani politics into new territory , since no pakistani leader has faced it before .
coalition leaders insist they have the numbers in parliament .
mr musharraf has previously said he would rather resign than face impeachment proceedings .
the president retains the power to dissolve parliament , but most analysts believe he is unlikely to do this .
he took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and gave up control of the army last year .
his allies were routed in elections in february .
mr musharraf was elected president for a five-year term last october in a controversial parliamentary vote .
he is still thought to have heavy influence over the military and its reaction will remain crucial .
pakistan has been ruled by military leaders for more than half of its existence since partition in 1947 .

internet users in russia and georgia have attacked vital websites in each other 's countries , in a virtual echo of battles being fought on the ground by troops and tanks .
several georgian government portals have been defaced or forced offline by hackers allegedly based in russia .
visitors to georgian president mikhail saakashvili 's website were recently routed to a page portraying him as a modern-day hitler .
georgia 's parliament and foreign ministry sites have also repeatedly been disabled , allegedly by attacks from networks of hijacked computers .
hackers from georgia have meanwhile been blamed for targeting the websites of russian news outlets and the separatist government of south ossetia , which russia supports . "
where extortion or fraud is involved , you can follow the money trail ...
but politically-motivated attacks are almost impossible to police " bill thompson technology critic internet security experts say it was inevitable that a conflict fired by separatism in the caucasus should spill into cyberspace .
the republics of the former soviet union are , along with china and brazil , major centres of cyber-crime , according to alex shipp of the email security firm , messagelabs .
while the chinese specialise in industrial espionage and the brazilians are adept at online financial fraud , mr shipp says russian criminals dominate the market in online tools tailored for amateur hackers .
" several russian sites specialise in selling software that would-be cyber-criminals can download , " he says .
' dark side ' russia 's association with cyber-crime dates back to the demise of the former soviet union - an event that roughly coincided with the dawn of the internet era in the early 1990s .
for thousands of youths who came of age as communism collapsed , computers symbolised the new spirit of enterprise .
treating programming as a tool for self-empowerment , these eager amateurs eventually became skilled software engineers .
they learnt their expertise , in part , from a brilliant earlier generation of soviet-era developers , says the bbc news website 's technology correspondent , mark ward .
these older programmers had devised clever software to sidestep the shortcomings of the clunky communist computers they had been forced to use .

bored and underpaid , many turned their talents to hacking .
gradually , they attracted new paymasters from the thriving post-soviet underworld .

hacking technology is also becoming increasingly accessible .
the most common form of attack uses networks of hijacked computers , or botnets , that besiege a site with more traffic than it can handle , eventually forcing it offline .

experts are more commonly responsible for " deface hacking " - attacks that manipulate the content on a secure website or divert traffic from it .
lawless space according to anton nosik , a russian businessman and internet pioneer , most hackers tend to be teenagers with broadband internet and limitless time on their hands .
he says websites hosted in countries with relatively small , under-developed networks are often most vulnerable to attack .
the georgian government , he says , ought to consider moving its websites to providers in the us or western europe if it hopes to reduce its exposure to attack .
in doing so , it would follow an example set by websites that support separatists from the russian republic of chechnya - also frequently targeted by hackers .
" websites run by chechen militants are hosted in western european countries with relatively large , secure networks - capable of handling larger volumes and less easily taken off air , " mr nosik says .
but , he warns , there is no foolproof defence against the most determined hackers , for whom russia remains a haven .
" the very notion of crime only exists in places where you have the law and the law is applied , " he says .
global laws governing cyberspace are still being devised .
in nations waging war , they are least likely to be applied .

advertisement the moment when three birds of prey were released a batch of white tailed sea eagles are being released from a secret location in fife in a bid to reintroduce the species to the east of scotland .
the 15 birds of prey were collected as chicks from nests in norway and raised in special aviaries .
the birds will be radio tagged so their progress can be tracked .
it is the second year the east scotland sea eagles -lrb- esse -rrb- project team have released the so-called " flying barn doors " into the wild .
esse is a five-year partnership project between rspb scotland , scottish natural heritage and the forestry commission .
the birds are being released three or four at a time over the course of the week .
clair smith , sea eagle project officer for rspb scotland , said she was keen to see how this year 's birds integrate .
she said : " from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june i 've watch them grow up and now they 're raring to go .
" i 'm really excited to see where they go and if they 'll meet up with last year 's birds . "
the introduction of chicks from norway to the east coast is part of the final phase of a programme to firmly establish a population of sea eagles right across scotland .
up to 20 young birds from norway will be released each year for the next three years .
the reintroduction programme began on the island of rum from 1975 to 1983 and then on wester ross from 1993 to 1998 .
breeding pairs have been established on territories as far south as the argyll islands and west on the mainland in the highland district of lochaber .
in march , one of the east coast chicks released last year was found on mull .

the 15 birds of prey were collected as chicks from nests in norway and raised in special aviaries .
the birds will be radio tagged so their progress can be tracked .
it is the second year the east scotland sea eagles -lrb- esse -rrb- project team have released the so-called " flying barn doors " into the wild .
esse is a five-year partnership project between rspb scotland , scottish natural heritage and the forestry commission .
the birds are being released three or four at a time over the course of the week .
clair smith , sea eagle project officer for rspb scotland , said she was keen to see how this year 's birds integrate .
she said : " from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june i 've watch them grow up and now they 're raring to go .
" i 'm really excited to see where they go and if they 'll meet up with last year 's birds . "
the introduction of chicks from norway to the east coast is part of the final phase of a programme to firmly establish a population of sea eagles right across scotland .
up to 20 young birds from norway will be released each year for the next three years .
the reintroduction programme began on the island of rum from 1975 to 1983 and then on wester ross from 1993 to 1998 .
breeding pairs have been established on territories as far south as the argyll islands and west on the mainland in the highland district of lochaber .
in march , one of the east coast chicks released last year was found on mull .
