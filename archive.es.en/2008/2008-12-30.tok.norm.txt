" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .

two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .

france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .

two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .

the chemical was found to be four times stronger than thc , the natural psychoactive substance contained in cannabis .
she also said that spice contained several other unknown elements , which could be harmful when smoked .
" it has been confirmed that the fashion-drug spice is indeed not the harmless herbal mixture its manufacturers say it is , " baetzing said .
" tests have shown that smoking the drug can cause undesirable side affects on the heart , circulation and nervous system , in some cases leading to unconsciousness .
there is also a danger of addiction . "
offenders under the drug 's new classification could face fines or jail terms .
authorities in several european countries have taken a closer look at the drug since it became popular in early 2008 .
the drug - also known as " spice silver , " " spice gold , " " spice diamond , " " spice arctic synergy " and " spice yukatan fire " - was made illegal in austria earlier this month .
baetzing said the ban would take the form of a decree modifying the controlled substances act .
it would remain in force until parliament acts on a long-term ban , probably within the space of one year . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.12.2008 germany to ban cannabis-like drug spice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spice is usually rolled into cigarettes and smoked like cannabis the production , trade and sale of the in-drug " spice " will likely be illegalized from january under german narcotics laws , the country 's federal drugs commissioner said in berlin on tuesday . sabine baetzing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said that new studies of the herbal drug had shown a synthetic material named jwh-018 was used in its production .
the chemical was found to be four times stronger than thc , the natural psychoactive substance contained in cannabis .
she also said that spice contained several other unknown elements , which could be harmful when smoked .
" it has been confirmed that the fashion-drug spice is indeed not the harmless herbal mixture its manufacturers say it is , " baetzing said .
" tests have shown that smoking the drug can cause undesirable side affects on the heart , circulation and nervous system , in some cases leading to unconsciousness .
there is also a danger of addiction . "
offenders under the drug 's new classification could face fines or jail terms .
authorities in several european countries have taken a closer look at the drug since it became popular in early 2008 .
the drug - also known as " spice silver , " " spice gold , " " spice diamond , " " spice arctic synergy " and " spice yukatan fire " - was made illegal in austria earlier this month .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .

in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .

israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .

two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .

to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .

large columns of tanks , military vehicles and buses with israeli soldiers on board meanwhile have moved southwards since sunday .
the israeli army on monday also declared the area around gaza a " closed military zone , " meaning no civilians will be allowed through roadblocks set up on key entry roads .
the israeli cabinet on sunday authorized the call up of 6,500 reserve soldiers . since the truce began disintegrating in early november , israel 's borders with gaza have been completely shut to all but sporadic shipments of basic humanitarian supplies . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .
in recent months , the commission has dealt with a slew of state-aid cases as eu member states have rushed to protect their financial sectors in the global financial storm .
the pressure has been so great that the brussels executive has revised its own state-aid rules to make it easier to deal with the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .
in recent months , the commission has dealt with a slew of state-aid cases as eu member states have rushed to protect their financial sectors in the global financial storm .
the pressure has been so great that the brussels executive has revised its own state-aid rules to make it easier to deal with the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.12.2008 europe calls for ceasefire in gaza as israel continues air raids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders have called on both hamas and israel to end the violence the european union called tuesday for a permanent ceasefire to end the violence in the gaza strip even as israel said its air assault is " just the beginning " of operations aimed at ending militant rocket fire . as israeli bombing of the gaza strip continued for a fourth day , france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday urged israel and hamas to end the bloodshed .
" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .
israel preparing for ground offensive ?

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .

israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .

hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .

likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .

hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .

mannichl was recently released from hospital after undergoing emergency surgery .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .
in recent months , the commission has dealt with a slew of state-aid cases as eu member states have rushed to protect their financial sectors in the global financial storm .
the pressure has been so great that the brussels executive has revised its own state-aid rules to make it easier to deal with the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .

steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .

the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .
israel preparing for ground offensive ?
large columns of tanks , military vehicles and buses with israeli soldiers on board meanwhile have moved southwards since sunday .
the israeli army on monday also declared the area around gaza a " closed military zone , " meaning no civilians will be allowed through roadblocks set up on key entry roads .
the israeli cabinet on sunday authorized the call up of 6,500 reserve soldiers . since the truce began disintegrating in early november , israel 's borders with gaza have been completely shut to all but sporadic shipments of basic humanitarian supplies . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .

" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .

the chemical was found to be four times stronger than thc , the natural psychoactive substance contained in cannabis .
she also said that spice contained several other unknown elements , which could be harmful when smoked .
" it has been confirmed that the fashion-drug spice is indeed not the harmless herbal mixture its manufacturers say it is , " baetzing said .
" tests have shown that smoking the drug can cause undesirable side affects on the heart , circulation and nervous system , in some cases leading to unconsciousness .
there is also a danger of addiction . "
offenders under the drug 's new classification could face fines or jail terms .
authorities in several european countries have taken a closer look at the drug since it became popular in early 2008 .
the drug - also known as " spice silver , " " spice gold , " " spice diamond , " " spice arctic synergy " and " spice yukatan fire " - was made illegal in austria earlier this month .
baetzing said the ban would take the form of a decree modifying the controlled substances act .
it would remain in force until parliament acts on a long-term ban , probably within the space of one year . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .
in recent months , the commission has dealt with a slew of state-aid cases as eu member states have rushed to protect their financial sectors in the global financial storm .
the pressure has been so great that the brussels executive has revised its own state-aid rules to make it easier to deal with the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .

" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .
israel preparing for ground offensive ?
large columns of tanks , military vehicles and buses with israeli soldiers on board meanwhile have moved southwards since sunday .
the israeli army on monday also declared the area around gaza a " closed military zone , " meaning no civilians will be allowed through roadblocks set up on key entry roads .
the israeli cabinet on sunday authorized the call up of 6,500 reserve soldiers . since the truce began disintegrating in early november , israel 's borders with gaza have been completely shut to all but sporadic shipments of basic humanitarian supplies . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .

steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .

" on the one hand we need to boost the economy , on the other hand we must make sure that a policy of cheap money does not lead to a new growth bubble founded on credit , as happened after sept .
11 , 2001 , " steinbrueck said .
" it is therefore important that the focus , at least in germany , be on sustainable investments in infrastructure and less on consumer spending financed by debt , " he told afp .
" this is also an argument against hasty tax cuts , " he added .
with global money markets taking a battering in recent months and consumers reining in their spending on fears of future instability , central banks around the world have taken to reducing borrowing costs to motivate shoppers into parting with their cash .
tax cuts unintelligent : steinbrueck germany released an economic stimulus package in november aimed at spurring growth , but chancellor angela merkel 's government has come under pressure to do more to ease the economic strain on germany .
merkel 's cabinet is to meet january 5 to discuss a second stimulus package , but steinbrueck insists there will be no place in the second plan for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automaker opel is waiting on a government package to help it out of trouble " what we do must be intelligent , be fair to future generations and reap future benefits , " he said .
" making temporary cuts in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , for example , fulfils none of these criteria . "
steinbrueck told the passauer neue presse daily that reducing germans ' health insurance contributions would be more effective in putting money into consumers ' pockets because half of all households already paid zero income tax .
the second package is likely to help the struggling german auto industry and as well as untangle significant infrastructure projects caught up in red tape , the finance minister said .
eu approves german method to ward off recession parallel to steinbrueck 's calls for refraining from increasing consumer debt levels , the european union 's executive approved tuesday a german initiative to stave off recession by offering firms over 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- in low-interest loans .
the plan is aimed at protecting the " real " - non-financial - economy from recession .
it was the first such package to be approved under the european commission 's revised system .
the package consists of a loan fund of up to 15 billion euros for companies which have difficulties in borrowing money due to the global financial squeeze .
the maximum low-interest loan any one firm can receive from the scheme is 50 million euros , with companies whose turnover is greater than 500 million euros per year excluded . the plan also includes a separate program capped at 500,000 euros per company for emergency grants to firms operating on the local or national level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loan plan is designed to stimulate cash flow in the real economy rules changed both programs are short-term and were drawn up in line with the commission 's recently revised rules on state aid , the commission said in a statement .

" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .
israel preparing for ground offensive ?
large columns of tanks , military vehicles and buses with israeli soldiers on board meanwhile have moved southwards since sunday .
the israeli army on monday also declared the area around gaza a " closed military zone , " meaning no civilians will be allowed through roadblocks set up on key entry roads .
the israeli cabinet on sunday authorized the call up of 6,500 reserve soldiers . since the truce began disintegrating in early november , israel 's borders with gaza have been completely shut to all but sporadic shipments of basic humanitarian supplies . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.12.2008 europe calls for ceasefire in gaza as israel continues air raids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders have called on both hamas and israel to end the violence the european union called tuesday for a permanent ceasefire to end the violence in the gaza strip even as israel said its air assault is " just the beginning " of operations aimed at ending militant rocket fire . as israeli bombing of the gaza strip continued for a fourth day , france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner on tuesday urged israel and hamas to end the bloodshed .
" we want a ceasefire .
we want it to be permanent , to be respected , with humanitarian access because there are many victims ... and also a return to the peace process , " kouchner said at a hastily arranged crisis meeting on the gaza violence in paris .
france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the emergency meeting of european diplomats on tuesday evening as a response to the spiraling violence in the middle east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the escalation of violence in the mideast has sparked a flurry of international diplomacy the meeting opened as the so-called " quartet " of middle east mediators - the united nations , eu us and russia - held a conference call on the outbreak of hostilities , and a day after french president nicolas sarkozy discussed the crisis in a telephone call with his egyptian counterpart , hosny mubarak .
the eu 's priority is to broker an end to the fighting and a return to a peace negotiated by egyptian mediators in june , french officials said ahead of the tuesday meeting .
in addition , the 27-member bloc is keen to see the gaza strip re-opened to humanitarian aid , cut off since israel began its aerial bombardment of the territory on saturday .
to that end , kouchner and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , called for a temporary ceasefire to allow aid workers into the strip in separate conversations with top israeli , egyptian and syrian officials .
israel rejects notion of ceasefire but on tuesday a spokesman for olmert ruled out the idea of a ceasefire .
" giving hamas a rest period to re-group and rearm , reducing the pressure on that organization , would be a mistake , " spokesman mark regev told german news agency dpa .
earlier israeli interior minister meir sheetrit said " there is no room for a ceasefire " with hamas until the threat of rocket fire had been removed .
and israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the four-day-old bombardment of gaza was the " the first of several stages " of a planned offensive .
likud leader benjamin netanyahu told reuters the jewish state would eventually have to remove hamas from power in the gaza strip .
" whether it can be done right now is something i do n't think we should discuss here .
but it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n't do it , then hamas will rearm itself , " he said .
heavy casualties in gaza strip palestinians say 380 people have been killed so far in israeli air strikes and over 1,500 injured .
" we are living in horror , we and our children .
the situation is not just bad , it is tragic , " gaza resident abu fares , standing outside his home , told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say the situation in gaza is desperate the un has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
it says at least 62 of the palestinians killed so far were women and children .
doctors in gaza say they are struggling to treat hundreds of injured and lack essential medical supplies .
israel has massed forces along the border with gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone . "
hamas strikes back but a defiant hamas , which has controlled gaza since 2007 , stepped up its attacks against israel , showering towns around gaza with dozens of rockets and reaching several in a circumference from the strip that had not previously been targeted .
two israelis were killed in the heavy barrage late monday , bringing the israeli toll since saturday to four dead and several dozen injured .
an israeli military spokeswoman in tel aviv said some 30 targets were struck early tuesday since midnight , after a total of some 70 were hit sunday .
among others , three buildings in the gaza city government headquarters of hamas , the radical islamic movement ruling gaza , were struck overnight .
the israel air force also bombed and rocketed more hamas outposts , as well as a number of rocket launching squads and launchers themselves , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has sparked pro-gaza protests around the world palestinians said the three buildings in the government complex included the interior ministry , the foreign ministry and the office of the de-facto prime minister , ismail haniya , of hamas .
the israeli offensive , which came eight days after hamas unilaterally ended a six-month truce , continued meanwhile to focus on airstrikes , but israel is in the advanced stages of preparing for a possible ground offensive as well .
israel preparing for ground offensive ?
large columns of tanks , military vehicles and buses with israeli soldiers on board meanwhile have moved southwards since sunday .
the israeli army on monday also declared the area around gaza a " closed military zone , " meaning no civilians will be allowed through roadblocks set up on key entry roads .
the israeli cabinet on sunday authorized the call up of 6,500 reserve soldiers . since the truce began disintegrating in early november , israel 's borders with gaza have been completely shut to all but sporadic shipments of basic humanitarian supplies . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the king 's fund is running a special project to try to get nurses and other staff to focus on being compassionate .
its chief executive , niall dickson , said this was a fundamental issue that should be a top priority for every hospital board .
he blames work pressures for staff being less feeling .
it 's to do with staff facing very difficult situations - because patients are sicker and hospital stays are shorter - rather than them all turning into nasty people mr dickson ' compassion key to care ' compassion is listed as a core value in the draft constitution for the nhs in england , and the government is developing methods for measuring it .
mr dickson said : " i have very little doubt that we 've seen a deterioration in the level of compassion that is shown by staff to patients .
" it 's to do with staff facing very difficult situations - because patients are sicker and hospital stays are shorter - rather than them all turning into nasty people .
" if we ca n't get compassion into our healthcare , the system is failing .
it 's as fundamental as that .
" the board of every hospital should be looking at this as one of their top priorities - what is it like for someone who 's coming in to be treated , and how can we improve that experience ? "
the king 's fund is piloting an idea called " schwartz rounds " at several nhs hospitals .

aged 101 , he was sent home from hospital on an hour-long journey in a taxi , wearing ill-fitting pyjamas .
after a five-day stay on a mixed ward , his clothes that were soiled with excrement were put in the same bag as his clean ones .
salisbury hospital in wiltshire says it has apologised to the platt family .
but mrs platt wept as she said : " you just do n't do that to people .
all he had left was his dignity .
" his hearing aid was squashed and his false teeth were lost .
the teeth were brand new - he had insisted on having new ones and they had cost him a lot of money , but he did n't want to ever be seen without his teeth in .
" i was so furious .
i think respect in that situation is the same as compassion . "
war hero brigadier john platt had led his men in a heroic assault across a river in italy during the second world war .
he was awarded a distinguished service order .
i felt they did n't acknowledge he was an old man of 101 who deserved respect amanda platt mrs platt added : " everybody 's got to die .
he was obviously going to die and he wanted to die .
" it was n't because he was a heavily decorated soldier - but i felt they did n't acknowledge he was an old man of 101 who deserved respect . "
salisbury district hospital said : " clearly some aspects of brigadier platt 's discharge in 2006 were unacceptable and the trust apologises for any distress that this caused the patient and his family .
" in apologising , the trust also acknowledges the concerns raised about some of brigadier platt 's personal effects .
" the trust takes all complaints seriously so that it can learn from these experiences . "
deterioration the head of the king 's fund think-tank has told the bbc he is convinced there has been a deterioration in the level of compassion that staff have shown patients in recent years .
when i was a cancer patient , i felt like i 'd finally graduated from nursing school charlotte wilkinson various projects in the nhs are trying to address this issue - especially since lord darzi 's review emphasised the importance of quality in care .
in a simple exercise at one of london 's busiest hospitals - the royal free - ward sisters are being encouraged to take 20 minutes to sit and observe what life is like for patients .
caroline cahill , from an acute medical ward for older people , has taken part .
she said : " it was interesting to sit and listen - to hear the noise levels and conversations .
" you realise it can be quite aggravating for a patient to sit in a chair and hear this stuff all day . "
other measures include special pegs or warning signs , so that a patient 's privacy is maintained when curtains are drawn around a bed .
burn out the nurse running the royal free project , mary flatley , admits having experienced burnout several times in her career .
you should n't be there if you do n't think the humanity of medicine is as important as the science sir cyril chantler retiring paediatrician a particularly stressful time was when she returned to the wards after a spell in research and was in a busy area , constantly surrounded by death .
she said : " i came back into clinical work again in 2002 and found a very different health service - much more complex and faster .
" there were times when i felt i did n't get support , and that made me feel i was losing my compassion .
" hospital work has changed dramatically over the past 25 years .
" i was a ward sister in the 1980s and at that time people were in hospital longer .
some patients used to even help on the ward by giving out the tea . "
a nurse doing similar work at barnet and chase farm hospital in north london , charlotte wilkinson , said : " when i was a cancer patient , i felt like i 'd finally graduated from nursing school .
" it made me really appreciate the impact that small things can make on an experience in hospital . "

experience as a patient he has had a new heart valve fitted - and agrees with the theory that being a patient makes for a better doctor .
sir cyril , who was a paediatrician , said : " i 'd have been a much better doctor , during my time as a doctor , if i 'd been a patient a bit earlier in my life .
" you 've got to like people to be a nurse or a doctor .
our job is to serve the patient .
" you should n't be there if you do n't think the humanity of medicine is as important as the science .
" vocation is an old-fasioned word but i believe it 's still very important .
" in fact , my experience of interviewing large numbers of young people to go to medical school is that vocation is as alive and well now as it was when i qualified . "
the government is developing measures to define quality in the nhs , and ideas about compassion will be included , though pilot schemes have not yet begun .
privately , ministers say a change of culture is still needed in some parts of the health service .
staff themselves believe compassion requires the basics to be in place - such as adequate staffing levels .

it was a typical local " big house " near caernarfon , gwynedd , and no-one entered " unless you had business to be there " , according to nancy jones , 84 , who has lived close by in the village of llandwrog all her life .
now the house is being turned into a hotel , and people are - for the first time - being positively encouraged to walk in the door .
the wall which surrounds the glynllifon estate is 10 ft -lrb- 3m -rrb- high and eight miles long -lrb- 12 km -rrb- and a local landmark .
the main road from caernarfon to pwllheli also passes alongside , making it a familiar sight to thousands of tourists who holiday on the lleyn peninsula .
inside the wall there are numerous houses , an agricultural college , a country park , and the main glynllifon mansion .
the house itself is featured in the book forgotten welsh houses which showcases buildings - some grand , all of them historic - which have fallen on hard times . "
i remember when i was nine or ten that we 'd go up there and have a party , a present , and there was always a conjurer " nancy jones , local resident the fact that glynllifon is so big - it has 102 rooms - has meant that any future use was always somewhat limited - although a rock star did once try to buy it .
according to the book 's co-author mark baker , the fact that the plas has a new lease of life is " amazing " .
" i 'm glad it 's being given a new lease of life as it 's such a lovely building , " he added .
mrs jones remembers the plas of her childhood had plenty of staff .
" there were loads , all sorts , a butler a chauffeur , loads of men looking after the horses . "
there was also the christmas party for the local schoolchildren .
self-sufficient " i remember when i was nine or 10 that we 'd go up there and have a party , a present , and there was always a conjurer . "
life inside the estate was " very self-sufficient " and private .
" i was allowed to go to the estate to see my friend iris , because her father was the head cowman , but i never went to the big house , apart from at christmas .
" we did play in the garden if lord newborough was away though . "
what probably saved the plas , as it is today , was that it was taken on in 1954 by the local council , and used as offices and dormitories for the glynllifon agricultural college . "
there is a great sense of satisfaction when a project comes together " pravin jadeja , owner present owners pravin and tara jadeja bought the property from the council eight years ago .
because of its grade i listed status the first years were taken up with research and planning , before the work of restoring the fabric of the building could begin .
it is , according to mr jadeja , a project which they estimate will cost some £ 6m .
they have been able to attract £ 800,000 in grants from the european regional development fund and help from gwynedd council .
with a background in doing up old buildings , mr jadeja is realistic about the task ahead .
" my father did the same work and started me off sanding windows when i was as school - i used to hate the job , " he said .
" you do however have to start somewhere , and there is a great sense of satisfaction when a project comes together .
" as soon as one room is finished it gives you the motivation to move to the next . "
resident ghost eventually the aim is for a spa-style top class hotel , employing around 80 staff .
the plas is protected by its listed building status , and the couple have taken great care in how they approach the renovations .
" it 's been really difficult as it 's not a museum , and we have to look at it from a commercial point of view .
" but along the way we have become quite knowledgeable about the house , and the materials and colours used . "
there is also the matter of the large bat colony which live in one of the two cellars under the building .
they represent 20 % of the european population of lesser horseshoe bats , and the countryside council for wales has provided advice on how to look after them .
there is also a webcam so that bat lovers can see the roost .
all this is being watched over by the -lrb- apparently obligatory -rrb- resident ghost : maria stella was a young bride who came to the plas from her italian home in the 1700s to marry the then lord newborough .
" i have n't seen her myself , but a lot of people have had a ' feeling ' here , a presence , " said mr jadeja .
" it 's not a bad spirit , though : it 's a friendly house . "

it was a typical local " big house " near caernarfon , gwynedd , and no-one entered " unless you had business to be there " , according to nancy jones , 84 , who has lived close by in the village of llandwrog all her life .
now the house is being turned into a hotel , and people are - for the first time - being positively encouraged to walk in the door .
the wall which surrounds the glynllifon estate is 10 ft -lrb- 3m -rrb- high and eight miles long -lrb- 12 km -rrb- and a local landmark .
the main road from caernarfon to pwllheli also passes alongside , making it a familiar sight to thousands of tourists who holiday on the lleyn peninsula .
inside the wall there are numerous houses , an agricultural college , a country park , and the main glynllifon mansion .
the house itself is featured in the book forgotten welsh houses which showcases buildings - some grand , all of them historic - which have fallen on hard times .
i remember when i was nine or ten that we 'd go up there and have a party , a present , and there was always a conjurer nancy jones , local resident the fact that glynllifon is so big - it has 102 rooms - has meant that any future use was always somewhat limited - although a rock star did once try to buy it .
according to the book 's co-author mark baker , the fact that the plas has a new lease of life is " amazing " .
" i 'm glad it 's being given a new lease of life as it 's such a lovely building , " he added .
mrs jones remembers the plas of her childhood had plenty of staff .
" there were loads , all sorts , a butler a chauffeur , loads of men looking after the horses . "
there was also the christmas party for the local schoolchildren .
self-sufficient " i remember when i was nine or 10 that we 'd go up there and have a party , a present , and there was always a conjurer . "
life inside the estate was " very self-sufficient " and private .
" i was allowed to go to the estate to see my friend iris , because her father was the head cowman , but i never went to the big house , apart from at christmas .
" we did play in the garden if lord newborough was away though . "
what probably saved the plas , as it is today , was that it was taken on in 1954 by the local council , and used as offices and dormitories for the glynllifon agricultural college .
there is a great sense of satisfaction when a project comes together pravin jadeja , owner present owners pravin and tara jadeja bought the property from the council eight years ago .
because of its grade i listed status the first years were taken up with research and planning , before the work of restoring the fabric of the building could begin .
it is , according to mr jadeja , a project which they estimate will cost some £ 6m .
they have been able to attract £ 800,000 in grants from the european regional development fund and help from gwynedd council .
with a background in doing up old buildings , mr jadeja is realistic about the task ahead .
" my father did the same work and started me off sanding windows when i was as school - i used to hate the job , " he said .
" you do however have to start somewhere , and there is a great sense of satisfaction when a project comes together .
" as soon as one room is finished it gives you the motivation to move to the next . "
resident ghost eventually the aim is for a spa-style top class hotel , employing around 80 staff .
the plas is protected by its listed building status , and the couple have taken great care in how they approach the renovations .
" it 's been really difficult as it 's not a museum , and we have to look at it from a commercial point of view .
" but along the way we have become quite knowledgeable about the house , and the materials and colours used . "
there is also the matter of the large bat colony which live in one of the two cellars under the building .
they represent 20 % of the european population of lesser horseshoe bats , and the countryside council for wales has provided advice on how to look after them .
there is also a webcam so that bat lovers can see the roost .
all this is being watched over by the -lrb- apparently obligatory -rrb- resident ghost : maria stella was a young bride who came to the plas from her italian home in the 1700s to marry the then lord newborough .
" i have n't seen her myself , but a lot of people have had a ' feeling ' here , a presence , " said mr jadeja .
" it 's not a bad spirit , though : it 's a friendly house . "

the stk39 gene variant was found after scanning the entire genetic code of hundreds of people in the us and europe .
those with the variant had raised blood pressure compared with those carrying other versions .
the us research was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
this discovery has great potential for enhancing our ability to tailor treatments to the individual dr yen-pei christy chang university of maryland high blood pressure , also called hypertension , is important because , over time , it can increase the chances of heart problems , strokes and kidney failure .
it is thought that one in four people living in western countries has high blood pressure , often undiagnosed .
scientists looking for genetic vulnerabilities to the condition have explored dozens of possible genes , but stk39 has emerged as a front runner following the university of maryland school of medicine study .
the researchers concentrated their efforts on 542 members of the amish community in pennsylvania , looking at their entire genetic make-up while testing their blood pressure .
when this linked variants of the stk39 gene to high blood pressure , it made sense - the gene produces a protein which controls how the kidneys process salt - a key factor in changing blood pressure .
lifestyle choices the result was reproduced when other groups caucasian volunteers were tested , and the researchers estimated that 20 % from this ethnic group carried it .
dr yen-pei christy chang , one of the researchers , said : " this discovery has great potential for enhancing our ability to tailor treatments to the individual - what we call personalised medicine . "
however , he added : " hypertension is a very complex condition , with numerous other genetic , environmental and lifestyle factors involved .
" the stk39 gene is only one important piece of the puzzle . "
professor alan shuldiner , also from the university of maryland , said : " with this new scanning approach , we are able to uncover genes that have previously eluded us . "
mike rich , the executive director of the blood pressure association , described the research as " interesting " .
" it may help us identify those individuals who may be more prone to hypertension , " he said .
" however , there are already indicators which can help us determine who is more likely to develop the condition , such as a family history of hypertension , heart disease , stroke , and poor diet and lack of exercise .
" the things you learn from your parents in terms of lifestyle and habits will probably have as much effect on your chances of developing hypertension as the genes they pass down to you . "
professor mark caulfield , a researcher in the genetics of hypertension from queen mary 's , university of london , said the evidence pointed towards many different genes each having a small effect on blood pressure .

the head of the tuc has warned the uk faces " mass unemployment " next year and called on the government to tackle it with a " more balanced economy " .
brendan barber said 2009 would be " a grim year " with unemployment set to rise every month .
making the recession " as short and shallow as possible " should be a top priority , and may involve more support for the banks , he added .
but he said 2009 could be a decisive turning point if bold action was taken .
the government should look towards " a fairer , more balanced economy delivering sustainable prosperity , " to counter the recession and save jobs , mr barber said in the union 's new year message .
on monday , the chartered institute of personnel and development warned that at least 600,000 jobs could go in the uk next year .
it said the time between new year and easter will be the worst for job losses since 1991 .
bold action he blamed the finance and banking sectors for the recession , but said the government should be prepared to offer further financial assistance to troubled financial institutions .
" banks are putting building up their balance sheets and paying back government loans as their top priorities .
but they hold high levels of toxic debt which prevent them from dealing with other banks in a normal way .
" the government and the bank of england must , therefore , consider injecting even more support into the financial system to get credit flowing again , " he said .
mr barber said that the government could not be expected to come to the rescue of every troubled company , but that it should be prepared to provide " short term assistance to companies in sectors vital to the future of britain " .
and he called for better benefits and training for the unemployed , urging them to be treated " not as potential scroungers but victims of economic forces beyond their control " .
turning point the year would be tough , mr barber said , " but it can still be made positive if it becomes a turning point - the year in which we set out to build a deliberately different kind of economy " .
" we have given far too much weight to the interests of the financial sector , and began to believe it could create wealth simply by moving it around , rather than through long term investment in the goods and services that people want and need , " he added .

the head of the tuc has warned the uk faces " mass unemployment " next year and called on the government to tackle it with a " more balanced economy " .
brendan barber said 2009 would be " a grim year " with unemployment set to rise every month .
making the recession " as short and shallow as possible " should be a top priority , and may involve more support for the banks , he added .
but he said 2009 could be a decisive turning point if bold action was taken .
the government should look towards " a fairer , more balanced economy delivering sustainable prosperity , " to counter the recession and save jobs , mr barber said in the union 's new year message .
on monday , the chartered institute of personnel and development warned that at least 600,000 jobs could go in the uk next year .
it said the time between new year and easter will be the worst for job losses since 1991 .
bold action he blamed the finance and banking sectors for the recession , but said the government should be prepared to offer further financial assistance to troubled financial institutions .
" banks are putting building up their balance sheets and paying back government loans as their top priorities .
but they hold high levels of toxic debt which prevent them from dealing with other banks in a normal way .
" the government and the bank of england must , therefore , consider injecting even more support into the financial system to get credit flowing again , " he said .
mr barber said that the government could not be expected to come to the rescue of every troubled company , but that it should be prepared to provide " short term assistance to companies in sectors vital to the future of britain " .
and he called for better benefits and training for the unemployed , urging them to be treated " not as potential scroungers but victims of economic forces beyond their control " .
turning point the year would be tough , mr barber said , " but it can still be made positive if it becomes a turning point - the year in which we set out to build a deliberately different kind of economy " .
" we have given far too much weight to the interests of the financial sector , and began to believe it could create wealth simply by moving it around , rather than through long term investment in the goods and services that people want and need , " he added .

brendan barber said 2009 would be " a grim year " with unemployment set to rise every month .
making the recession " as short and shallow as possible " should be a top priority , and may involve more support for the banks , he added .
but he said 2009 could be a decisive turning point if bold action was taken .
the government should look towards " a fairer , more balanced economy delivering sustainable prosperity , " to counter the recession and save jobs , mr barber said in the union 's new year message .
on monday , the chartered institute of personnel and development warned that at least 600,000 jobs could go in the uk next year .
it said the time between new year and easter will be the worst for job losses since 1991 .
bold action he blamed the finance and banking sectors for the recession , but said the government should be prepared to offer further financial assistance to troubled financial institutions .
" banks are putting building up their balance sheets and paying back government loans as their top priorities .
but they hold high levels of toxic debt which prevent them from dealing with other banks in a normal way .
" the government and the bank of england must , therefore , consider injecting even more support into the financial system to get credit flowing again , " he said .
mr barber said that the government could not be expected to come to the rescue of every troubled company , but that it should be prepared to provide " short term assistance to companies in sectors vital to the future of britain " .
and he called for better benefits and training for the unemployed , urging them to be treated " not as potential scroungers but victims of economic forces beyond their control " .
turning point the year would be tough , mr barber said , " but it can still be made positive if it becomes a turning point - the year in which we set out to build a deliberately different kind of economy " .
" we have given far too much weight to the interests of the financial sector , and began to believe it could create wealth simply by moving it around , rather than through long term investment in the goods and services that people want and need , " he added .

the union said that figure was set to rise to more than £ 1m in the new year .
the buildings - spread across england - are part of plans to cut the number of control centres from 46 to nine .
the unused centres are in durham , wakefield , warrington , leicestershire , wolverhampton , cambridge , london , hampshire and somerset , said the fbu .
the unused buildings belmont business park , durham paragon business village , wakefield lingley mere business park , great sankey , warrington willow farm business park , castle donington , leicestershire wolverhampton business park , wolverhampton cambridge research park ; merton industrial estate , london south east fareham , hampshire blackbrook business park , taunton , somerset a government spokesman said the centres were not standing idle but were providing training facilities for staff .
the union said the centres were supposed to be operational by 2007 , but were now unlikely to be used before 2010 at the earliest .
some of the centres are ready but they are not being used , apart from the occasional meeting , the fbu said .
it blames computer problems for repeatedly delaying the conversion project .
matt wrack , fbu general secretary , said : " local authorities are getting just £ 15m for the massive task of ensuring that arrangements are in place to assess and manage local flood risk .
" yet the government is prepared to spend that sum every two years on empty buildings .
if this happened in business , someone would be held accountable . "
olympic fears the fbu also warned that the regional control centres might not be ready and fully operational for the 2012 london olympics .
it also said the whole nationwide system would need to be up and running for the centres to work properly .
mr wrack said : " to be effective , the regional control centres need to be up and running 12 months before the olympics to iron out any problems . "
a communities and local government spokesman said : " new regional control centre buildings are not standing idle .
" they are being fitted out with it and other equipment , being used for the developing and testing of systems , and providing familiarisation and training facilities for fire service staff and elected members .
" the national network will be operational from spring 2012 . "
