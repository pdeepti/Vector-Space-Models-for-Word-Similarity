the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "
this situation , gallois warned , " must be corrected . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .

forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .

the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "

the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "
this situation , gallois warned , " must be corrected . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
a titan loved in the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's heroics in 2002 made him a legend in the far east the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
kahn became immensely popular in asia for his 2002 heroics at the world cup in japan and south korea .
he is named " king kahn " and " titan " in asia , banners tuesday in kolkata 's salt lake arena read " kah n't get any better " and the match itself was dubbed " oliver kahn 's farewell match . "
the stadium was sold out for the first time in more than a decade to mark the special occasion .
bayern arrived in kolkata on monday , the last stop of a 10-day swing through asia which wrapped up their season .
among other activities , kahn and other players visited a youth tournament in the city .
winning end to an illustrious career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn signed off his career as a winner munich won their last match of the season on tuesday from a double by jan schlaudraff in the 18th and 51st , and a curling 37th-minute free-kick from ze roberto .
mohun bagan , who famously held pele 's cosmos new york to a 2-2 draw in 1977 , were too harmless to create serious danger , with kahn saving from p c lalampuia shortly before halftime and another effort bouncing off the bar .
the match ended on a sour note as branko cardozo from the hosts and munich 's breno were sent off in the closing stages , cardozo for a ruthless tackle on breno and the brazilian for kicking cardozo in the aftermath .
neither team was at full strength , with munich missing its various international players on euro 2008 duty , and the hosts without their four india internationals and injured brazilian striker barreto .
kahn was not the only famous munich man to bid farewell .
coach ottmar hitzfeld was also on the bayern bench for the last time as he takes over the swiss national team after euro 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .
" negotiations will certainly not be easy .
they will be complex negotiations .
i do n't want to speculate at this moment , but i think they will take quite some time , " the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .

he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
kahn became immensely popular in asia for his 2002 heroics at the world cup in japan and south korea .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .

klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .

jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .
and he 's created negative headlines again this summer after making homophobic remarks in the tv documentary .

i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .

in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gfk analysts said consumers were more aware of rising prices than of the boost to their incomes ushered in by several major labor contracts in recent months which are expected to be widely imitated . consumer opinion diverges from federal data the national economic-output data from federal officials in wiesbaden , which combines previous monthly data and finalizes the march growth figure , suggests germany has suffered only a glancing blow from the slowdown in the us economy and soaring commodities prices . federal statistics office analysts said the growth had been driven by construction and corporate investment rather than by consumer spending , which had however improved slightly . german exports remained strong , despite the high foreign exchange value of the euro , but foreign trade was no longer a net contributor to gdp growth because of germany 's soaring import bills . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.05.2008 presidency dispute deepens rift in merkel 's coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan lost the 2004 vote by a narrower-than-expected margin the decision by germany ’ s social democrats to field an opposition candidate for the next presidential election is a risky move , analysts say .
but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .
and that would be " a bad start " to the elections , he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

he asserted that participation was " overwhelming " with 80 per cent of farmers taking part " in some regions . "
the unsold milk is being fed to calves or dumped in farm-waste tanks .
the farmers are angry at eu plans to increase output quotas and depress the market price of milk in the european union .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . but schaber advised hospitals and retirement homes to stockpile milk before shortages began . " all we can do now is use our milk as a weapon , " he said .
" milk is might , and we have the milk . " the bdm said a farm gate price of less than 40 euro cents per liter for milk was uneconomic . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he asserted that participation was " overwhelming " with 80 per cent of farmers taking part " in some regions . "
the unsold milk is being fed to calves or dumped in farm-waste tanks .
the farmers are angry at eu plans to increase output quotas and depress the market price of milk in the european union .
brussels says it must respond to growing global demand for milk , especially from booming asian nations . but schaber advised hospitals and retirement homes to stockpile milk before shortages began . " all we can do now is use our milk as a weapon , " he said .
" milk is might , and we have the milk . " the bdm said a farm gate price of less than 40 euro cents per liter for milk was uneconomic . germany 's dairy farms are controlled by a few powerful companies which currently pay 27 cents a liter in northern germany and 35 cents a liter in southern germany for milk , according to bdm data . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .

despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .

merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .

a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv north america : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 27.05.2008 on the subject of football : is football a business like any other ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professional soccer is big business .
germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .
" that 's true of all the presidential candidates , but for him especially , " voigt told the tagesspiegel .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .

" work on the graveyard for the remains of around 4,000 german soldiers will start this year , but most of the work will be carried out next year , " town spokesman , tomas ivanic , told afp news agency . remains discovered last year the soldiers ' remains have been held at a military training base since they were uncovered by czech media in march 2006 at a vacant factory in the northern city of usti nad labem .
czech president vaclav klaus ordered that the remains be temporarily stored at the base until a permanent solution could be found . critics of the decision to transfer the bodies to cheb expressed concern that the town would become a pilgrimage site for german and czech neo-nazis . the remains of the soldiers to be reburied there were discovered at various locations in the czech republic , including some mass graves , the german war graves authority has said . soldiers fell in final days an estimated 178,000 german soldiers died during world war ii in former czechoslovakia fighting soviet forces from the north and east and us forces from the west . fighting in former czechoslovakia remained heavy in the final weeks of the war as hitler carried out his futile " final victory " strategy , sending thousands of german troops to their deaths although the outcome of the war had already been decided .
prague was the last major city to be liberated by the allies . other german soldiers who fell in czechoslovakia have already been buried in the existing 10 military cemeteries around the country . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .

however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .

in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .

gfk analysts said consumers were more aware of rising prices than of the boost to their incomes ushered in by several major labor contracts in recent months which are expected to be widely imitated . consumer opinion diverges from federal data the national economic-output data from federal officials in wiesbaden , which combines previous monthly data and finalizes the march growth figure , suggests germany has suffered only a glancing blow from the slowdown in the us economy and soaring commodities prices . federal statistics office analysts said the growth had been driven by construction and corporate investment rather than by consumer spending , which had however improved slightly . german exports remained strong , despite the high foreign exchange value of the euro , but foreign trade was no longer a net contributor to gdp growth because of germany 's soaring import bills . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" work on the graveyard for the remains of around 4,000 german soldiers will start this year , but most of the work will be carried out next year , " town spokesman , tomas ivanic , told afp news agency . remains discovered last year the soldiers ' remains have been held at a military training base since they were uncovered by czech media in march 2006 at a vacant factory in the northern city of usti nad labem .
czech president vaclav klaus ordered that the remains be temporarily stored at the base until a permanent solution could be found . critics of the decision to transfer the bodies to cheb expressed concern that the town would become a pilgrimage site for german and czech neo-nazis . the remains of the soldiers to be reburied there were discovered at various locations in the czech republic , including some mass graves , the german war graves authority has said . soldiers fell in final days an estimated 178,000 german soldiers died during world war ii in former czechoslovakia fighting soviet forces from the north and east and us forces from the west . fighting in former czechoslovakia remained heavy in the final weeks of the war as hitler carried out his futile " final victory " strategy , sending thousands of german troops to their deaths although the outcome of the war had already been decided .
prague was the last major city to be liberated by the allies . other german soldiers who fell in czechoslovakia have already been buried in the existing 10 military cemeteries around the country . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .
" negotiations will certainly not be easy .
they will be complex negotiations .
i do n't want to speculate at this moment , but i think they will take quite some time , " the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .
and he 's created negative headlines again this summer after making homophobic remarks in the tv documentary .

getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .

and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .

gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gfk analysts said consumers were more aware of rising prices than of the boost to their incomes ushered in by several major labor contracts in recent months which are expected to be widely imitated . consumer opinion diverges from federal data the national economic-output data from federal officials in wiesbaden , which combines previous monthly data and finalizes the march growth figure , suggests germany has suffered only a glancing blow from the slowdown in the us economy and soaring commodities prices . federal statistics office analysts said the growth had been driven by construction and corporate investment rather than by consumer spending , which had however improved slightly . german exports remained strong , despite the high foreign exchange value of the euro , but foreign trade was no longer a net contributor to gdp growth because of germany 's soaring import bills . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "
this situation , gallois warned , " must be corrected . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .

the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .

while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "
this situation , gallois warned , " must be corrected . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .

noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "

" work on the graveyard for the remains of around 4,000 german soldiers will start this year , but most of the work will be carried out next year , " town spokesman , tomas ivanic , told afp news agency . remains discovered last year the soldiers ' remains have been held at a military training base since they were uncovered by czech media in march 2006 at a vacant factory in the northern city of usti nad labem .
czech president vaclav klaus ordered that the remains be temporarily stored at the base until a permanent solution could be found . critics of the decision to transfer the bodies to cheb expressed concern that the town would become a pilgrimage site for german and czech neo-nazis . the remains of the soldiers to be reburied there were discovered at various locations in the czech republic , including some mass graves , the german war graves authority has said . soldiers fell in final days an estimated 178,000 german soldiers died during world war ii in former czechoslovakia fighting soviet forces from the north and east and us forces from the west . fighting in former czechoslovakia remained heavy in the final weeks of the war as hitler carried out his futile " final victory " strategy , sending thousands of german troops to their deaths although the outcome of the war had already been decided .
prague was the last major city to be liberated by the allies . other german soldiers who fell in czechoslovakia have already been buried in the existing 10 military cemeteries around the country . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .
" negotiations will certainly not be easy .
they will be complex negotiations .
i do n't want to speculate at this moment , but i think they will take quite some time , " the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .
and he 's created negative headlines again this summer after making homophobic remarks in the tv documentary .

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de far-right npd appoints holocaust denier as vice president germany 's main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , embraced a leading extremist sunday , may 25 but avoided explicit expressions of neo-nazi opinion which are prohibited under german law .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .
" that 's true of all the presidential candidates , but for him especially , " voigt told the tagesspiegel .
meanwhile , the weekly news magazine stern gushed : " the ' new kennedy ' wants to visit berlin . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .

more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .

organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .

gfk analysts said consumers were more aware of rising prices than of the boost to their incomes ushered in by several major labor contracts in recent months which are expected to be widely imitated . consumer opinion diverges from federal data the national economic-output data from federal officials in wiesbaden , which combines previous monthly data and finalizes the march growth figure , suggests germany has suffered only a glancing blow from the slowdown in the us economy and soaring commodities prices . federal statistics office analysts said the growth had been driven by construction and corporate investment rather than by consumer spending , which had however improved slightly . german exports remained strong , despite the high foreign exchange value of the euro , but foreign trade was no longer a net contributor to gdp growth because of germany 's soaring import bills . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .

jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .

such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's about the sausage " is german idiom meaning that the matter at hand is really , really important .
but two men from the city of muenster took the saying literally , engaging in fisticuffs over a bratwurst . there are plenty of legitimate reasons to engage in violence .
you can fight for your life , your country , your future , your right to party and certainly a sausage - if it 's the last one left at a barbeque .
but fighting over mustard ?
two german men thought the condiment was important enough to get physical about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... a fork ai n't shabby either the incident occurred at a discotheque in muenster , when a 23-year-old order a bratwurst with plenty of hot stuff .
displeased with the amount of yellow on his wiener , the man first demanded more , then tried to take matters into his own hands by grabbing a tube of mustard .
the sausage vendor objected , and things took their course , with the two alleged members of homo sapiens hitting and trying to strangle one another . they also threw sausages and squirted mustard on each other 's clothing .
police intervened before the situation turned fatal .
the combatants were charged with misdemeanour , then released .
neither were injured , police said , just a little black and blue - and , of course , yellow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 27.05.2008 telekom breaks more than privacy laws in criminal spy case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom confirmed reports that managers ' phone records were monitored deutsche telekom broke more than privacy laws in the criminal spy affair , said legal expert thomas hoeren .
but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 27.05.2008 berlin on the itinerary for bush , possibly for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin could be busy entertaining this summer in june , george w. bush plans to make what 's likely to be his last visit to berlin as us president .
but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .

on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .
" that 's true of all the presidential candidates , but for him especially , " voigt told the tagesspiegel .
meanwhile , the weekly news magazine stern gushed : " the ' new kennedy ' wants to visit berlin . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de far-right npd appoints holocaust denier as vice president germany 's main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , embraced a leading extremist sunday , may 25 but avoided explicit expressions of neo-nazi opinion which are prohibited under german law .

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaftsbilanz we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .
and he 's created negative headlines again this summer after making homophobic remarks in the tv documentary .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .

despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .

" work on the graveyard for the remains of around 4,000 german soldiers will start this year , but most of the work will be carried out next year , " town spokesman , tomas ivanic , told afp news agency . remains discovered last year the soldiers ' remains have been held at a military training base since they were uncovered by czech media in march 2006 at a vacant factory in the northern city of usti nad labem .
czech president vaclav klaus ordered that the remains be temporarily stored at the base until a permanent solution could be found . critics of the decision to transfer the bodies to cheb expressed concern that the town would become a pilgrimage site for german and czech neo-nazis . the remains of the soldiers to be reburied there were discovered at various locations in the czech republic , including some mass graves , the german war graves authority has said . soldiers fell in final days an estimated 178,000 german soldiers died during world war ii in former czechoslovakia fighting soviet forces from the north and east and us forces from the west . fighting in former czechoslovakia remained heavy in the final weeks of the war as hitler carried out his futile " final victory " strategy , sending thousands of german troops to their deaths although the outcome of the war had already been decided .
prague was the last major city to be liberated by the allies . other german soldiers who fell in czechoslovakia have already been buried in the existing 10 military cemeteries around the country . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.05.2008 presidency dispute deepens rift in merkel 's coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan lost the 2004 vote by a narrower-than-expected margin the decision by germany ’ s social democrats to field an opposition candidate for the next presidential election is a risky move , analysts say .
but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .
and that would be " a bad start " to the elections , he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .

meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .

schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .

but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .

but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

" work on the graveyard for the remains of around 4,000 german soldiers will start this year , but most of the work will be carried out next year , " town spokesman , tomas ivanic , told afp news agency . remains discovered last year the soldiers ' remains have been held at a military training base since they were uncovered by czech media in march 2006 at a vacant factory in the northern city of usti nad labem .
czech president vaclav klaus ordered that the remains be temporarily stored at the base until a permanent solution could be found . critics of the decision to transfer the bodies to cheb expressed concern that the town would become a pilgrimage site for german and czech neo-nazis . the remains of the soldiers to be reburied there were discovered at various locations in the czech republic , including some mass graves , the german war graves authority has said . soldiers fell in final days an estimated 178,000 german soldiers died during world war ii in former czechoslovakia fighting soviet forces from the north and east and us forces from the west . fighting in former czechoslovakia remained heavy in the final weeks of the war as hitler carried out his futile " final victory " strategy , sending thousands of german troops to their deaths although the outcome of the war had already been decided .
prague was the last major city to be liberated by the allies . other german soldiers who fell in czechoslovakia have already been buried in the existing 10 military cemeteries around the country . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 27.05.2008 telekom breaks more than privacy laws in criminal spy case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom confirmed reports that managers ' phone records were monitored deutsche telekom broke more than privacy laws in the criminal spy affair , said legal expert thomas hoeren .
but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .
from a marketing point of view - violating telecommunications privacy as the number one in germany and in europe in the telecommunications sector is the worst marketing you can imagine . interview : kateri jochum -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de deutsche telekom ceo vows tough action on spying scandal deutsche telekom head rene obermann said the firm would take tough action if it was confirmed that employees breached privacy laws by monitoring phone calls between the top company officials and journalists .

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .
" that 's true of all the presidential candidates , but for him especially , " voigt told the tagesspiegel .

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "
however , he also said that the job-cutting foreseen for airbus in the so-called power 8 cost-saving program " was not progressing as quickly in germany as in france . "

" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .
" negotiations will certainly not be easy .
they will be complex negotiations .
i do n't want to speculate at this moment , but i think they will take quite some time , " the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .

and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .

a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

the sausage vendor objected , and things took their course , with the two alleged members of homo sapiens hitting and trying to strangle one another . they also threw sausages and squirted mustard on each other 's clothing .
police intervened before the situation turned fatal .
the combatants were charged with misdemeanour , then released .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .

the match ended on a sour note as branko cardozo from the hosts and munich 's breno were sent off in the closing stages , cardozo for a ruthless tackle on breno and the brazilian for kicking cardozo in the aftermath .
neither team was at full strength , with munich missing its various international players on euro 2008 duty , and the hosts without their four india internationals and injured brazilian striker barreto .
kahn was not the only famous munich man to bid farewell .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .
from a marketing point of view - violating telecommunications privacy as the number one in germany and in europe in the telecommunications sector is the worst marketing you can imagine . interview : kateri jochum -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de deutsche telekom ceo vows tough action on spying scandal deutsche telekom head rene obermann said the firm would take tough action if it was confirmed that employees breached privacy laws by monitoring phone calls between the top company officials and journalists .

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live global 3000 - das globalisierungsmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 27.05.2008 telekom breaks more than privacy laws in criminal spy case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom confirmed reports that managers ' phone records were monitored deutsche telekom broke more than privacy laws in the criminal spy affair , said legal expert thomas hoeren .
but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .
some politicians and consumer protection groups have advocated tightening privacy laws .
are they really in need of reform in germany or did the former telekom management just act way out of line ? the interesting problem in this case is that state attorneys are now investigating what happened at deutsche telekom , but this can only lead to a punishment for individuals acting as representatives of deutsche telekom .
the company as such is out of bounds . what people now want are increased sanctions against the company , not just against the individuals behind the company .
in the current situation , deutsche telekom can only get a fine of perhaps 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- , which is nothing for them . so we need an increase of sanctions against companies . how do you think deutsche telekom will survive this latest blow ? they will have more and more problems .

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
a titan loved in the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's heroics in 2002 made him a legend in the far east the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
kahn became immensely popular in asia for his 2002 heroics at the world cup in japan and south korea .
he is named " king kahn " and " titan " in asia , banners tuesday in kolkata 's salt lake arena read " kah n't get any better " and the match itself was dubbed " oliver kahn 's farewell match . "
the stadium was sold out for the first time in more than a decade to mark the special occasion .
bayern arrived in kolkata on monday , the last stop of a 10-day swing through asia which wrapped up their season .
among other activities , kahn and other players visited a youth tournament in the city .
winning end to an illustrious career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn signed off his career as a winner munich won their last match of the season on tuesday from a double by jan schlaudraff in the 18th and 51st , and a curling 37th-minute free-kick from ze roberto .
mohun bagan , who famously held pele 's cosmos new york to a 2-2 draw in 1977 , were too harmless to create serious danger , with kahn saving from p c lalampuia shortly before halftime and another effort bouncing off the bar .
the match ended on a sour note as branko cardozo from the hosts and munich 's breno were sent off in the closing stages , cardozo for a ruthless tackle on breno and the brazilian for kicking cardozo in the aftermath .
neither team was at full strength , with munich missing its various international players on euro 2008 duty , and the hosts without their four india internationals and injured brazilian striker barreto .
kahn was not the only famous munich man to bid farewell .
coach ottmar hitzfeld was also on the bayern bench for the last time as he takes over the swiss national team after euro 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 27.05.2008 telekom breaks more than privacy laws in criminal spy case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom confirmed reports that managers ' phone records were monitored deutsche telekom broke more than privacy laws in the criminal spy affair , said legal expert thomas hoeren .
but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .

but without tighter corporate sanctions , it wo n't have to pay with much more than a hurt reputation . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom has confirmed allegations that former high-level executives secretly analyzed the phone bills of their fellow managers to identify leaks to the press .
the scandal is the latest in a series of surveillance cases in germany , where international companies have been caught monitoring their employees . dw-radio spoke with thomas hoeren , a professor in business , telecommunications and media law at the university of muenster , who said that , in the case of deutsche telekom , much more than an infringement of privacy laws is at stake . dw-radio : there have been a number of cases of companies monitoring their employees in germany recently .
for example , discount supermarket lidl was recently called on the carpet for doing the same .
what 's unique about the deutsche telekom case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo obermann said the phones were n't tapped and that customers ' rights were n't violated thomas hoeren : the special situation in germany is that we have more and more cases where companies are watching their employees .
in general , this is n't a problem .
monitoring employees is allowed by law . but in this specific case at deutsche telekom , they collected all the telephone data from their ceos and the people supervising the company .
this is not a simple violation of data protection or privacy regulations .
it is a violation of telecommunications secrecy , which is protected under criminal law .
criminal prosecutors are now investigating the case . deutsche telekom 's ceo rene obermann made a point of saying that the telephones were not tapped and that the privacy of private customers was not violated .
as legal council is looking at this case , will that make a difference ? if a company allows its employees to use the telephones in their offices for private use , they are no longer regarded as employees but as private persons .
there is a kind of privacy , even if you are employed in a company . in this case , deutsche telekom allows their employees to use their telephones for private calls and so they are not allowed to monitor what they are doing with the telephone connections . the reason that deutsche telekom did this is that they were afraid that secrets were being leaked to the press , so it did have something to do with the work situation .
now journalists are saying that the freedom of the press has been violated as well .
do you agree ? yes , perfectly .
there is no way that a company can justify violating telecommunications secrecy .
if they have a problem with the press , they can ask a state attorney for help and there are media laws which might help them . but here we do have a violation of press freedom because the press has the right to have contact to people , which is protected under the constitution .
so it 's a double problem : on the one hand , the violation of telecommunications secrecy and , on the other hand , an implicit attack on freedom of press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair will hurt telekom 's credibility , said hoeren as you said , this has implications for constitutional law as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sausage vendor objected , and things took their course , with the two alleged members of homo sapiens hitting and trying to strangle one another . they also threw sausages and squirted mustard on each other 's clothing .

gfk analysts said consumers were more aware of rising prices than of the boost to their incomes ushered in by several major labor contracts in recent months which are expected to be widely imitated . consumer opinion diverges from federal data the national economic-output data from federal officials in wiesbaden , which combines previous monthly data and finalizes the march growth figure , suggests germany has suffered only a glancing blow from the slowdown in the us economy and soaring commodities prices . federal statistics office analysts said the growth had been driven by construction and corporate investment rather than by consumer spending , which had however improved slightly . german exports remained strong , despite the high foreign exchange value of the euro , but foreign trade was no longer a net contributor to gdp growth because of germany 's soaring import bills . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
a titan loved in the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's heroics in 2002 made him a legend in the far east the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
kahn became immensely popular in asia for his 2002 heroics at the world cup in japan and south korea .
he is named " king kahn " and " titan " in asia , banners tuesday in kolkata 's salt lake arena read " kah n't get any better " and the match itself was dubbed " oliver kahn 's farewell match . "
the stadium was sold out for the first time in more than a decade to mark the special occasion .
bayern arrived in kolkata on monday , the last stop of a 10-day swing through asia which wrapped up their season .
among other activities , kahn and other players visited a youth tournament in the city .
winning end to an illustrious career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn signed off his career as a winner munich won their last match of the season on tuesday from a double by jan schlaudraff in the 18th and 51st , and a curling 37th-minute free-kick from ze roberto .
mohun bagan , who famously held pele 's cosmos new york to a 2-2 draw in 1977 , were too harmless to create serious danger , with kahn saving from p c lalampuia shortly before halftime and another effort bouncing off the bar .
the match ended on a sour note as branko cardozo from the hosts and munich 's breno were sent off in the closing stages , cardozo for a ruthless tackle on breno and the brazilian for kicking cardozo in the aftermath .
neither team was at full strength , with munich missing its various international players on euro 2008 duty , and the hosts without their four india internationals and injured brazilian striker barreto .
kahn was not the only famous munich man to bid farewell .
coach ottmar hitzfeld was also on the bayern bench for the last time as he takes over the swiss national team after euro 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a fundamental interest in intensifying nato-russian cooperation , " merkel said .
" for the first time in years we have had a russia-nato summit -lrb- at bucharest in april -rrb- .
if we do n't talk to each other it is no wonder when there are prejudices , " merkel said .
the german chancellor called for more regular nato-russia summits , " not in order to give russia a say -lrb- in nato affairs -rrb- but in order to appreciate each other 's fears and interests . "
strained ties relations between russia and nato have been frosty in recent months in light of the military alliance 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards to ukraine and georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains wary of nato 's intentions moscow remains deeply suspicious about nato 's push into former soviet territory . the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . "
new eu pact with russia merkel added on monday that talks on us plans for a missile defence shield in eastern europe , a project bitterly opposed by moscow , are " of the highest importance . "
the missile shield is one of several key issues along with tensions over georgia expected to come up in talks when new russian president dmitry medvedev visits germany at the beginning of june .
merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .
the new partnership agreement would cover political and economic ties , including energy and trade .
the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .
the eu hopes to launch the talks formally at an eu-russia summit in siberia next month .
while the eu is hoping to make a fresh start with russia under its new president , dmitry medvedev , the talks are likely to be long and difficult .
although trade between russia and eu states has boomed in recent years , the political relationship has become increasingly strained .
" negotiations will certainly not be easy .
they will be complex negotiations .
i do n't want to speculate at this moment , but i think they will take quite some time , " the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , former russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia .
" the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest last month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .

" nato is not a democratizer . "

merkel 's comments came on the same day that the european union gave the go-ahead for a new pact with russia after 18 months of delay .

the talks are likely to address issues such as security of energy supplies and human rights .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .

jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .

two familiar faces are back in the bundesliga , while leverkusen and hamburg try something new . leverkusen did n't waste much time replacing michael skibbe , who was axed last week after the promising side fell apart late in the season and missed out on international competition .
the new man at the helm is bruno labbadia , a former german national and the only person in history to score one hundred or more goals in both second- and first-division german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is looking for goals - lots of them labbadia comes form second-division greuther fuerth , and leverkusen fans can expect the same sort of attacking soccer for which he was known as a player .
but if the members of the squad think next season will be all fun and games , they should think again .
" i do n't like to get too familiar with players , " labbadia said at the press conference where his appointment was made official .
" i want to be near them but still keep my distance . "
his goal will be to get leverkusen back among the top five .
if he fails , not only could his tenure be brief - it might also cost leverkusen sporting director rudi völler his job .
dortmund get klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp may get a bit hot under the collar at dortmund borussia dortmund have gone for a very different sort of coach , jürgen klopp .
klopp spent seven years - three of them in the first division - at mainz , where his approachability and boyish passion for the game made him both a fan and a player favorite .
getting the tiny rhineland club to be competitive in the top flight was certainly an achievement , and klopp is now charged with reviving dortmund after a moribund league campaign .
but " kloppo , " as he 's affectionately known , faces arguably the toughest test in bundesliga coaching , dealing with dortmund 's often chaotic management and the huge expectations of its legions of fans .
that was a challenge to which klopp 's equally gregarious predecessor thomas doll ultimately proved unequal .
jol heads hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bada bing - martin jol is coming to hamburg hamburg were fairly pleased with their fourth-place finish last season but needed a replacement for coach huub stevens , who 's returning to the netherlands for personal reasons .
and the northern german club decided double dutch was the way to go , enticing former tottenham coach martin jol to the banks of the river elbe .
jol had a fairly successful spell with spurs , and since his nickname is " tony soprano , " after the us tv character , there should be no let-up in intensity .
jol has said he need only " five minutes to consider " before taking the job .
but his fate in hamburg , however , may depend on another of his compatriots - star playmaker raffael van der vaart , who 's entering the final year of his contract and has tried to force a move before .
if van der vaart departs , jol may find himself without the firepower needed to keep hamburg in the top five .
daum finally decides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum 's hair was full of legal drugs after cologne got promoted meanwhile cologne are relieved that they do n't need a new coach .
after much hemming and hawing , christoph daum announced this week that he would stay on at the newly promoted club .
his most immediate task will be to keep the three-time german champions , who have been relegated four times in eleven years , in the top flight .
there 's no doubting daum 's credentials .
in 2000 , he was literally a hair 's breadth away from becoming germany 's national coach - his appointment was cancelled at the last minute , after a drugs test on a hair sample confirmed rumors that he used cocaine .

however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's bundesliga posted record sales last year , one point seven billion euro .
should soccer be organised according to market criterias ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : fernando silveira r. age : 18 occupation : undergraduate student city / country : são josé , brazil football has become business analyzing recent years .
what was in the first instance , superficially , " leisure " has been sold to big megalomaniac entrepreneurs , which are taking the soul of a competitiveness leisure off the supporters and according to the rivers of money that are being injected into the clubs as an investment are mutating them , turning them into political business .
it depreciates and derespects the supporters role and feelings when in the stadium with their loved team .
just as a quick note .
unfortunately soccer is already business and is tending to become only that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 24 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyadh , saudi arabia football is for sure a business like any other .
however , it is not as big as many people think .
i have the following points : club owners most of the time have other businesses to support the club ’ s expenditure .
only few clubs are really profitable and will have stable increasing profits for so many year to make investors happy .
sport companies like adidas are working on very low profit margins -lrb- between 4 % and 6 % , while other business are working on 20 % to 30 % profit margin -rrb- and you can not have many companies like those , so less people can get the money from the sport business .
in other words , market share is more or less limited to small number of players that are even in the best cases will not be doing very good compared to other businesses .
not all countries are lucky like germany or europe in general to have this much people spending money on sport .
in many countries , people are less welling to spend on tickets , t-shirts , tv channels subscriptions , and so on there is a very big future of the sport business in general , but it will still depend on how other businesses are doing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : gwendolyn kyoburungi z. age : 43 occupation : water resources manager city / country : entebbe , uganda i agree that professional soccer should be organised according to market criterias because there is a lot of money making , exchanges , competition when buying of football players / transfers , the wage bracket and many other marketing processes involved . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people in the german capital are more enthusiastic about seeing another prominent us politician . bush is scheduled to spend june 10 and 11 in germany as part of a week-long trip to europe .
bush 's berlin visit will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the marshall plan , the american credit and assistance program that helped europe - including germany - rebuild after world war ii .
bush 's presence is likely to elicit public protests , as has been the case on all of the president 's precious visits to germany .
hundreds of thousands of germans demonstrated against bush in 2002 in the run-up to the iraq war - although the numbers of protestors have declined on subsequent visits .
bildunterschrift : bush is not very popular in germany the german government has not released a precise itinerary for bush 's trip , but it said it would announce specifics at a later date .
obamania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many americans , large numbers of germans have fallen for obama and bush is n't the only top american politician to whom berliners may be treated this summer .
on tuesday may 27 , karsten voigt - the government envoy for german-american relations - said that likely democratic presidential candidate barack obama was also considering coming to the german capital .
" if a us presidential hopeful visits berlin , holding a speech at the brandenburg gate and going afterward to the kennedy museum , it provides powerful images for the american electorate , " voigt told the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
spiegel magazine also reported that obama had told german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that he would like to visit germany as soon as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama may soon be smiling at the brandenburg gate at this point , such considerations remain quite vague , but the mere prospect of the charismatic illinois senator in the german capital had politicians and reporters swooning .
the federal government , voigt said , would eagerly welcome obama .
" that 's true of all the presidential candidates , but for him especially , " voigt told the tagesspiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .
germany 's economy minister michael glos managed to attach a protocol to the bill which states that the text would be modified if brussels renews legal action . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.05.2008 presidency dispute deepens rift in merkel 's coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan lost the 2004 vote by a narrower-than-expected margin the decision by germany ’ s social democrats to field an opposition candidate for the next presidential election is a risky move , analysts say .
but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .
and that would be " a bad start " to the elections , he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it could have a big payoff , as well . the spd , the junior partner in germany ’ s ruling coalition government , said on monday , may 26 that it will once again put up gesine schwan as candidate for german presidential election a year from now , in may , 2009 .
schwan , a 65 year old academic and expert in german-polish relations , was the spd candidate in the last presidential vote in 2004 , where she narrowly lost to current president horst koehler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler recently said he would run again the announcement unleashed a whirlwind of criticism and rhetoric from german politicians , some of whom went so far as to warn it could break up the ruling coalition between the spd and the christian democratic union / christian socialist union parties that has governed germany since 2005 .
the cdu / csu supports incumbent koehler .
the german presidency is a largely ceremonial job that carries a five-year term .
presidents are elected in secret ballot by a body called the federal assembly , which is made up of parliamentarians and delegates chosen by state legislatures .
in 2004 , koehler was able to best schwan because he had the support of the then-conservative federal assembly .
but a recent shift to the left in german politics , especially the growth of the controversial far-left left party , means a left-wing party has a good chance of fielding a winning candidate in 2009 .
party in search of profile thomas meyer , a political science professor at the dortmund university of technology who has worked with the spd-affiliated friedrich ebert foundation , says the spd move can essentially be seen as a bid for a stronger party profile - something that has been lacking on the left recently .
" the spd is looking for a symbolic piece of politics to identify and motivate the party , and make it clear it has its own political message , instead of just joining on with the cdu , " meyer said .
" the criticism is that spd hides behind the cdu too much .
they are trying to end this perception . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler enjoys a high popularity among voters meanwhile , the fact remains that schwan can only be elected with the support of votes associated with the greens and the left party - a radical left-wing party with roots in the former east german communist party .
de-facto left-spd collaboration ?
while the spd , left and greens together would have enough popular support among voters to form a government , spd leader kurt beck has stated in the past that he will never form a federal coalition with the left .
now , many observers see the decision to put up a presidential candidate as a de-facto move toward collaboration .
meyer agrees this could be " an unavoidable side effect " of the spd decision to back schwan in the presidential race .
" as soon as the spd has a candidate of its own and the left supports that candidate , then a new way and new form of cooperation unavoidably will ensue , " he said .
for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .

for their part , cdu / csu supporters are not happy about the kind of message the spd is sends by opposing the presidential candidate put forth by its own coalition partner .
schwan candidacy seen as provocation ralf baus , team leader of the domestic policy division of the cdu-affiliated konrad adenauer foundation , acknowledges that the spd has the right to put up a candidate , as do all the parties .
still , " considering that the spd is in a grand coalition with the cdu at the moment , and that it can only hope to win the election with help from the left party … that is definitely a provocation , " he said .
it is especially irritating given that koehler enjoys immense popularity , continued baus .
some polls show the current president with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent .
" it would be one thing if this president had made mistakes , or wasn ’ t well liked .
that would give the spd an argument ...
but the number of people who would like to see him back in office is extremely high .
to my mind , the spd has to give a good reason why they would want to replace him , " baus said .
presidential vote : sign of things to come ?
so far the spd has cited polls that show germans say they would like to have a female president – an explanation that doesn ’ t carry much weight , according to baus .
nor does it matter that schwan , president of viadrina university , near the polish border , is generally considered an able candidate who is well-liked enough to draw votes across party lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan , known for her trademark smile instead , he suggests the decision to back schwan is a sign of " internal divisions " within the spd .
" beck used to support koehler , but the left wing of his party wanted this .
they pressured him , " posited baus .
to an outsider , all the speculating and posturing over an election that is a year away , for a position that carries no power , could seem like much ado about nothing .
but observers point out that presidential elections in germany are frequently harbingers of national politics – and note that parliamentary elections are set for september , 2009 , just a few months after the presidential vote .
" if you look back in history , you will see that in the procedure of electing president , coalitions formed that had a very important role to play .
the process of who supports presidents is more important than the outcome , " meyer explained .
outcome is difficult to foresee " in this case it could open the avenue between normalizing relations between the spd , the greens and the left , " he added .
who will benefit most from the decision to challenge koehler is anyone ’ s guess , however .
a too-close association with the left party could damage the spd by alienating some of their middle-of-the-road members , baus said .
alternately , if the cdu / csu and their allies the free democrats can ’ t manage to get koehler elected , it could , indeed , signal a change in power ahead of the parliamentary vote .
and that would be " a bad start " to the elections , he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .

noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "

airbus , a wholly-owned subsidiary of eads , will bring in half of the sales volume , gallois told the company 's annual general meeting in amsterdam .
while gallois remained upbeat about long-term prospects , he said current high feul prices could lead to a drop in orders in the near future .
" in coming quarters , i expected the order flow to slow , especially because of the difficulties airlines are having because of the sharp rise in oil prices , " he said .
delays will be minimal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus hopes to increase sales at monday 's shareholder meeting , gallois was asked several times about the latest delays to its flagship a380 superjumbo project .
galloise said the deliveries would be delayed three or five months , but not more .
gallois stressed that " ramping up -lrb- a380 -rrb- production was underway and so we are not faced with the same catastrophe we faced two years ago but -lrb- the ramping-up -rrb- is not going fast enough . "
airbus confirmed earlier this month that the a380 would have to push back its delivery schedule .
the program has already faced three production delays that put the jet 18 months behind schedule and forced airbus and parent company eads to pay an estimated 3.87 billion euros compensation to customers .
now , airbus says 12 of the aircraft will be delivered in 2008 instead of the 13 forecast , and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had expected .
additionally , gallois said the first flight of the a400m military transport , also facing delays , is planned for this summer .
vote of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois wants to create a better working environment eads president ruediger grube said he had faith in the company 's management despite a continuing investigation into insider trading by the french amf financial authority .
noel forgeard , former co-chief executive at eads , has been called to speak with the authorities in connection with the probe , sources close to the matter told the french news agency afp monday .
they said forgeard , who resigned in july 2006 , was to appear wednesday .
forgeard has denied any wrongdoing .
to date , no one has been placed under formal investigation .
the amf suspects 17 representatives of the major stakeholders , germany 's daimler and france 's lagardere , as well as top airbus and eads managers , of dumping eads shares before it became clear in mid 2006 that airbus was facing severe delays in its a380 superjumbo program .
franco-german tensions flare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more delays for the a380 on monday , the french daily le parisien reported tensions between the firm 's french and german managers .
the chamber of commerce and industry of the city of toulouse , where airbus has its headquarters , had sent a letter to french finance minister christine lagarde complaining about the actions of german eads executives , the paper said .
the letter , which was sent one week ago , accused german management of having " purposely wrecked " plans to sell two airbus plants to the french aircraft supplier latecoere .
the letter accuses german managers of a " manipulation " aimed at " ruining " french interests and which will " lead to the death of thousands of jobs in france . "
the toulouse chamber of commerce urged the french government , which owns 15 percent of eads , to take actions to prevent what it calls a " catastrophe . "
in an interview published friday in the daily la depeche du midi , gallois , admitted that passions were running high , but he called on everyone concerned to " put an end to these sterile debates , which create a hateful climate . "

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de far-right npd appoints holocaust denier as vice president germany 's main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , embraced a leading extremist sunday , may 25 but avoided explicit expressions of neo-nazi opinion which are prohibited under german law .

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet there was also plenty of interest in the latest jumbo jets and sleek fighter planes . with oil prices soaring , the talk of the berlin air show this week will center around how to make aviation more efficient .
high fuel prices and environmental concerns are increasing demand for light , fuel-efficient planes .
with prices rising as high as $ 135 -lrb- 86 euros -rrb- per barrel last week , alternative fuels are expected to draw interest at the show , formally known as the aerospace exhibition and conferences -lrb- ila -rrb- .
it runs from tuesday , may 27 through sunday at berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
as much as it is a chance for industry insiders to catch up on the latest trends , it is a chance for companies to strut their stuff with flight shows and competitions .
at this year 's event , a special ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the berlin airlift is also planned .
off to a roaring start bildunterschrift : a eurofighter jet shows what it 's made of europe 's most modern fighter jets showed off their tactical prowess tuesday .
there were also plenty of people checking out the latest military choppers and transporters .
and that was just a tiny fraction of the aircraft on display .
" we cover the entire spectrum from high performance military jets to commercial aircraft to ultralight flyers , " said director wolfram cornelius .
established in frankfurt in 1909 , the ila is today one of the world 's oldest and largest aviation trade shows .
the show moved to berlin in 1992 and has been held every two years at the schoenefeld airport .
organizers said more than 200,000 people were expected at the show by the time it ends on sunday .
it will be open to the public on friday only .
three giant aircraft dominated the state of the show tuesday , including the now-infamous jumbo a380 passenger plane .
the a380 , billed as the largest passenger plane of all times , has been dogged by manufacturing delays .
beside the a380 were the two biggest series-production planes ever made , the antonov an 124 and the c-5 galaxy .
there are more than 300 aircraft on show at the event , but there wo n't be any of the showy manoeuvers that come with other air shows out of saftey concerns .
a record 1,127 companies and institutions from the aerospace and defense industry have exhibits at the event .
spotlight on india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was in the spotlight this year this year , india was chosen as the " partner nation " for the fair .
in recent years asia has become a major growth market for european airplane manufacturers as demand continues to skyrocket .
jet airways , the rapidly expanding indian airline , picked up one of its new a330-200 from the euroepan airplane manufacturer airbus .
the plane was the eighth in an order for 15 of the two-engined wide-bodied jets , which are used on longe-range flights .
arakkaparambil kurian antony , the indian defense minister , toured the exhibits tuesday with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
but despite the presence of about 40 countries , the berlin air show is dominated by european names such as eads , airbus , eurocopter , eurofighter and eurojet .
and the industry remains central to the german economy .
more than 88,000 people work in the field and the number is growing .
" we reached this magical figure of 20 billion euros in sales last year .
sales have increased 3.8 percent and when you look at that , it is higher than the general economic growth rate in germany , " said thomas enders , who is the head of both airbus and the german aerospace industries association .
headed for space ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's space ambitions created an extra buzz the air show has attracted additional attention amid speculation that a european manned space flight might be possible as early as 2017 .
such a project would give a big boost to europe 's industry .
up to now , europe has relied on the americans and the russians for getting its astronauts into orbit .
the european company eads and the german space agency -lrb- dlr -rrb- have advanced ideas on how to use european equipment for manned space flight , including adaptation of a new space station freighter , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to carry people . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indian football officials heaped gifts on kahn at the end of the halftime break , ranging from a scooter to silver plates , a silvery boat model , trophies and diplomas .
" i want to say thank you for this great moment in my career .
this is very special .
thank you for this great night , " kahn told the fans in the stadium .
kahn left the pitch in the 55th minute after keeping a clean sheet , applauded by the fans who gave him a massive roar before he headed straight into the dressing room as the most visible sign that his career is over - with only a testimonial match between munich and germany 's national team wrapping up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , played 557 bundesliga games for sc karlsruhe and munich , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .

kahn became immensely popular in asia for his 2002 heroics at the world cup in japan and south korea .
he is named " king kahn " and " titan " in asia , banners tuesday in kolkata 's salt lake arena read " kah n't get any better " and the match itself was dubbed " oliver kahn 's farewell match . "
the stadium was sold out for the first time in more than a decade to mark the special occasion .

among other activities , kahn and other players visited a youth tournament in the city .

mohun bagan , who famously held pele 's cosmos new york to a 2-2 draw in 1977 , were too harmless to create serious danger , with kahn saving from p c lalampuia shortly before halftime and another effort bouncing off the bar .
the match ended on a sour note as branko cardozo from the hosts and munich 's breno were sent off in the closing stages , cardozo for a ruthless tackle on breno and the brazilian for kicking cardozo in the aftermath .
neither team was at full strength , with munich missing its various international players on euro 2008 duty , and the hosts without their four india internationals and injured brazilian striker barreto .
kahn was not the only famous munich man to bid farewell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.05.2008 germany rebuffs eu warning over " volkswagen law " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower saxony does n't want to lose control of vw germany wants to preserve its right to veto strategic decisions made by volkswagen .
the proposed " volkswagen law " has the european commission crying foul and threatening new court action . the german state of lower saxony has long held a de facto veto over any potential takeovers or other strategic decisions by volkswagen , which has its headquarters in the region .
but germany has ingored a european union court order to do away with the law .
in fact , the government wants to pass a new law which will protect public control over europe 's biggest car maker .
" if the current situation is formalized , the european commission has to start a procedure for non-respect of a court ruling on this matter , " spokesman oliver drewes told journalists in brussels .
drewes was referring to an october , 2007 ruling from the european union 's top court which threw out lower saxony 's right to block company decisions .
after the 2007 ruling , german officials removed provisions limiting voting rights of shareholders and set guidelines for who would sit on the vw supervisory board .
but they exploited ambiguous terms within the court ruling regarding the level of holding required to block major decisions .
lower saxony holds 20 percent of volkswagen 's shares .
normally , a blocking minority needs to own at least 25 percent of the company .
" we want to conserve as much as possible the existing volkswagen law and therefore to remove only the provisions declared contrary to european law , " a government statement quoted justice minister brigitte zypries as saying tuesday .
the eu is concerned that the proposed law restricts the free flow of capital in europe .
eu sees no " wiggle room " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the veto could be used to prevent a german factory from being closed " there is not room for wiggle , " drewes said .
" basically what the commission would expect is that the court ruling is fully respected and implemented . "
chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition discussed options for several months before deciding to support lower saxony .
the move is also backed by the trade union ig metall .
beyond preventing a hostile takeover , the law preserves the goverment 's ability to block strategic decisions such as plant relocations and job cuts .
drewes said that after seeing a final version of the german law , it might leave the eu with no other choice than to go back to court .
the original german " volkswagen law " dates back to 1960 when the company was being privatized .
the law aimed to protect it from hostile takeovers by foreign companies and ensures that workers play a significant role in decision making .
defiance could be short lived bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche wants more control porsche , which wants to bring both companies under the aegis of one holding company , also opposes the law .
porsche plans to raise its stake in vw from the current 31 percent to over 50 percent .
in a parallel case , porsche has also asked a norther german court to reject the state 's blocking minority power out of respect for european law .
and lower saxony has filed its own petition in yet another court to try and change the vw bylaws that would preserve the strategic veto .
if germany goes ahead with the new law , the european commission will give berlin two months formal notice to amend the legislation before returning to court .
that might be enough to kill the draft bill .

readers ' minds were on germany 's political wings this week as most wrote in to say they do not support a ban of the main far-right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , while others pondered the rise of the left . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . unless germany wishes to slide back to its days of intolerance seen under nazi rule or imitate oppressive marxism denial of speech and thought , it should never ban any party that peacefully assembles and expresses views on public policy .
germany 's greatest danger lies in the left and the demographic " islamification " of europe . - dr. david brook , us it appears not only ludicrous but ironic , that some voices in the german government and even some of the citizenry admit that various measures are taken for the purpose of eliminating the freedom of the ndp and others on the right .
yet these same government and public citizens simply swoon in fits of feminine ecstasy at giving every possible advantage to the left . - julian , us whereas an npd ban alone will not rid germany of its growing neo-nazi problem , it is a necessary first step .
a neo-nazi and neo-fascist party like the npd has no place in a liberal democracy , and especially not in germany .
the thought that tax payers should continue funding this party and that it should continue to have members in -lrb- sub-state -rrb- parliaments is outrageous .
it is important , however , to fight neo-nazis and right-wing extremists on all fronts .
a ban on the npd will thus have to be complemented by efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of neo-nazi ideology .
a comprehensive government and civil society effort will have to be at the heart of this .
dismantling only the organizational structures of the neo-nazi movement is fighting the symptoms , not the disease itself . - anne kreft , germany strange !
the mayor of bamberg claims to represent and promote freedom and rights , yet at the same time wanting to deny the freedom and rights of those who do not share the beliefs !
sounds like lenin , trotsky , and stalin to me ! - a. reinhardt knapp , us first of all , as long as left-wing parties peacefully assemble and advocate their platforms , no restriction should be made on their freedom of speech and assembly .
however , no political organization should be allowed to commit violence .
as for the cause of the rise of the left , i would guess that higher education in germany is dominated by the left and therefore has indoctrinated impressionable and idealistic students who have been shielded from the reality of death and oppression that have uniformly accompanied marxist rule . - dr. david brook , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dunnet head in caithness is home to seabirds including kittiwakes , guillemots and puffins .
management of the 27-hectare site has been handed over to the rspb by landowner ben colson .
the rspb said it hoped to improve tourism facilities at dunnet head to encourage more people to visit the area .
dunnet head , which lies further north than john o ' groats , is a nationally important home for a large variety of seabirds .
it really is a lovely site for wildlife , and the geographical significance makes it even more special pete mayhew rspb scotland mr colson said : " dunnet head is an amazing place with which my family - and many others - feel a real bond .
" we 're delighted to be able to pass the reins of managing such a special area over to an organisation which will ensure both wildlife and people are catered for .
" dunnet is rich in wildlife and in history and we 're happy to be able to work with an organisation whose ambitions for the site match our own . "
pete mayhew , rspb north scotland senior conservation manager , said : " the seabird city at dunnet head is a few miles further north than john o ' groats , and we 're delighted to take over the management of the site .
the area is said to be an important settlement for many seabirds " as well as the seabirds , we also hope to manage the land on top of the cliffs to provide habitat for corncrake , great yellow bumblebee and twite .
" there are n't really any facilities for visitors at the moment but we 're looking at how we might be able to provide these in the future , in which case we 'd hope that dunnet head might become an important stop off for visitors to the far north .
" it really is a lovely site for wildlife , and the geographical significance makes it even more special . "
the cliff-top grassland has in the past been grazed by sheep , with other areas providing a kitchen garden for those who lived and worked at dunnet head during world war ii .
the red sandstone cliffs exceed 90m in height in places but are mostly between 30m and 60m high .

dunnet head in caithness is home to seabirds including kittiwakes , guillemots and puffins .
management of the 27-hectare site has been handed over to the rspb by landowner ben colson .
the rspb said it hoped to improve tourism facilities at dunnet head to encourage more people to visit the area .
dunnet head , which lies further north than john o ' groats , is a nationally important home for a large variety of seabirds . "
it really is a lovely site for wildlife , and the geographical significance makes it even more special " pete mayhew rspb scotland mr colson said : " dunnet head is an amazing place with which my family - and many others - feel a real bond .
" we 're delighted to be able to pass the reins of managing such a special area over to an organisation which will ensure both wildlife and people are catered for .
" dunnet is rich in wildlife and in history and we 're happy to be able to work with an organisation whose ambitions for the site match our own . "
pete mayhew , rspb north scotland senior conservation manager , said : " the seabird city at dunnet head is a few miles further north than john o ' groats , and we 're delighted to take over the management of the site .
" as well as the seabirds , we also hope to manage the land on top of the cliffs to provide habitat for corncrake , great yellow bumblebee and twite .
" there are n't really any facilities for visitors at the moment but we 're looking at how we might be able to provide these in the future , in which case we 'd hope that dunnet head might become an important stop off for visitors to the far north .
" it really is a lovely site for wildlife , and the geographical significance makes it even more special . "
the cliff-top grassland has in the past been grazed by sheep , with other areas providing a kitchen garden for those who lived and worked at dunnet head during world war ii .
the red sandstone cliffs exceed 90m in height in places but are mostly between 30m and 60m high .

google 's claim follows viacom 's move to sue the video sharing service for its inability to keep copyrighted material off its site .
viacom says it has identified 150,000 unauthorised clips on youtube .
in court documents google 's lawyers say the action " threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information " over the web .
the search giant 's legal team also maintained that youtube had been faithful to the requirements of the 1998 digital millennium copyright act and that they responded properly to claims of infringement .
in papers submitted to a manhattan court , google said it and youtube " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
viacom disagreed that either firm had lived up to that standard and said that they had done " little or nothing " to stop infringement .
abuse in a rewritten lawsuit filed last month , viacom claimed youtube consistently allowed unauthorised copies of popular television programming and movies to be posted on its website and viewed tens of thousands of times .
it said it had identified more than 150,000 such abuses which included clips from shows such as south park , spongebob squarepants and mtv unplugged .
the company says the infringement also included the documentary an inconvenient truth which had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " .
viacom , which is asking for damages for the unauthorised viewing of its programming , said its tally represented only a fraction of the content on youtube that violates its copyrights .
" the availability on the youtube site of a vast library of the copyrighted works of plaintiffs and others is the cornerstone of defendants ' business plan , " viacom said .
viacom originally started legal action last year and filed an amended version last month .
earlier this month viacom chairman sumner redstone told dow jones : " when we filed this lawsuit , we not only served our own interests , we served the interests of everyone who owns copyrights they want protected . "
he added : " we can not tolerate any form of piracy by anyone , including youtube ... they can not get away with stealing our products . "
for its part , google said the only way the legal action would be resolved was in court .
google 's vice president of content partnerships david eun has said : " we 're going all the way to the supreme court .
we 've been very clear about it . "
after the legal action was first started , youtube launched an anti-piracy tool that checks uploaded videos against the original content in an effort to flag piracy .

nia wyn 's blue sky july is joined on the shortlist by dannie abse , whose book helped him overcome his grief after his wife died in a road crash .
the third contender tom bullough 's novel contrasts the life of two boys growing up in very different worlds .
the shortlist was announced at the hay literary festival in powys on monday .
welsh culture minister rhodri glyn thomas , announcing the shortlist for the £ 10,000 prize , whose overall winner will be announced in july , said the event showed wales had " arrived " and succeeded in nurturing authors .
the final three for the annual award , which is administered by the welsh national literature body academi , were whittled down from about 200 english-language books considered .
nia wyn 's work deals with her coming to terms with her son joe 's cerebral palsy .
the writer , who grew up in prestatyn and now lives in cardiff , said : " it 's an emotional journey from a place of absolute despair and darkness , through acceptance to a place of joy and light .
" passages in the book are events along that journey . "
she has described her book as her " therapy " while she and joe 's father alex worked to overcome their son 's condition and challenge doctors ' predictions about the quality of life they could expect for him .
having been told that joe would never recognise them and never speak , he is now able to see and talk and attends a mainstream school .
meanwhile , cardiff-born poet and writer dannie abse 's the presence deals with the immediate aftermath of his wife joan 's death in a car crash in 2005 , and coping with his loss .
he said he had " days of sloth " but " just raised moments to write something " .
he said : " i hope -lrb- without confidence -rrb- to articulate unhappiness is to diminish it . "
he said originally the writing had not been intended for publication but since people had been kind and responsive , he had been persuaded to make it public .
bullough 's the claude glass , which tells the story of two contrasting families living in the welsh borders through the eyes of their two very different children .
bullough said both the children who are at the heart of the book were " quite extreme as a perspective " .
one was " excessively imaginative " and the other a " feral child " who was also " almost a blank page " , he said .
judge trevor fishlock said all the books shortlisted spoke " of the vigour of writing in wales " .
the overall winner and the welsh-language book of the year will be announced in a ceremony in cardiff in july .

meanwhile , cardiff-born poet and writer dannie abse 's the presence deals with the immediate aftermath of his wife joan 's death in a car crash in 2005 , and coping with his loss .
he said he had " days of sloth " but " just raised moments to write something " .
he said : " i hope -lrb- without confidence -rrb- to articulate unhappiness is to diminish it . "
he said originally the writing had not been intended for publication but since people had been kind and responsive , he had been persuaded to make it public .
bullough 's the claude glass , which tells the story of two contrasting families living in the welsh borders through the eyes of their two very different children .
bullough said both the children who are at the heart of the book were " quite extreme as a perspective " .
one was " excessively imaginative " and the other a " feral child " who was also " almost a blank page " , he said .
judge trevor fishlock said all the books shortlisted spoke " of the vigour of writing in wales " .
the overall winner and the welsh-language book of the year will be announced in a ceremony in cardiff in july .
