but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .
eu leaders meet to discuss the plan at a summit on dec .

decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .

" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .

they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "

" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .

specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .

the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .

she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .

but the principality vows it won ’ t give up its bank secrecy altogether . the two-year bilateral accord is scheduled to be signed on monday , dec .
8 , said government spokesman max hohenberg .
in the past , both countries had to agree that fraud had occurred before a prosecution could be launched , he said . " from now on , fraud only needs to be recognized by us law , " hohenberg explained .
in the past , the us has also had to prove a deliberate tax fraud , a high standard that means liechtenstein bank accounts have been essentially impenetrable to outsiders .
but although the principality is under constant international pressure to revisit its secrecy laws and anonymous foundations , " it would be false to say we have given up banking secrecy , " hohenberg emphasized .
prince nikolaus , a member of liechtenstein ruling royal family who brokered the deal , stated that while he was willing to grant similar concessions within the european union , he requires double-taxation agreements and a commitment by countries to deal leniently with citizens that had hidden money from tax authorities in liechtenstein .
cooperation essential " we accept that more cooperation is necessary because there is more acute pressure , " he said .
" it is of high political importance to many countries .
money is a rare species for states - they need every penny . "
along with monaco and andorra , liechtenstein has been blacklisted by the organization for economic cooperation and development .

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .
secularism is taken very seriously in the country 's state schools , and in 2004 a law was passed that bans pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at school .

germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .
eu leaders meet to discuss the plan at a summit on dec .

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .
eu leaders meet to discuss the plan at a summit on dec .

4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .

the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .

the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .

but the principality vows it won ’ t give up its bank secrecy altogether . the two-year bilateral accord is scheduled to be signed on monday , dec .
8 , said government spokesman max hohenberg .
in the past , both countries had to agree that fraud had occurred before a prosecution could be launched , he said . " from now on , fraud only needs to be recognized by us law , " hohenberg explained .
in the past , the us has also had to prove a deliberate tax fraud , a high standard that means liechtenstein bank accounts have been essentially impenetrable to outsiders .
but although the principality is under constant international pressure to revisit its secrecy laws and anonymous foundations , " it would be false to say we have given up banking secrecy , " hohenberg emphasized .
prince nikolaus , a member of liechtenstein ruling royal family who brokered the deal , stated that while he was willing to grant similar concessions within the european union , he requires double-taxation agreements and a commitment by countries to deal leniently with citizens that had hidden money from tax authorities in liechtenstein .
cooperation essential " we accept that more cooperation is necessary because there is more acute pressure , " he said .
" it is of high political importance to many countries .
money is a rare species for states - they need every penny . "
along with monaco and andorra , liechtenstein has been blacklisted by the organization for economic cooperation and development .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .

decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .

lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .

judge wilfried hamm gave no further explanation for his ruling .
vows to appeal decision solms-baruth has vowed to appeal the decision all the way to the european court of human rights .
he claimed that after german reunification , his own father had " fought the german authorities tirelessly for restitution of the family 's estates and property - until his death in january 2006 . "

the case comes amid a renewed focus in recent months on the bomb plot , which was led by col. claus graf schenk von stauffenberg , in part because of the upcoming tom cruise film " valkyrie " based on the event .
cruise plays the aristocratic colonel in the film .
von stauffenberg placed the bomb in a conference room where hitler was meeting with his aides and military advisers , but the dictator excaped with scrapes and bruises .
many plotters were arrested and executed in revenge killings that saw some hanged by the neck with piano wire .
solms-baruth 's grandfather , a long-time anti-nazi , was involved in discussions of the plot and provided two of his mansions as meeting places .
later he stayed at castle hega , the home of the crown princess of sweden in stockholm , before leaving europe to move to namibia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

4 during his annual live television address to the nation , said he was confident russia would survive the global financial crisis with minimal losses . " our chances are good of going through this complicated period with minimal losses both for our economy and our citizens , " putin said in the question-and-answer session .
he added that , unlike other countries , russia will not be lowering pensions and unemployment benefits to its citizens .
while putin was president , the broadcast became an annual tradition and helped him boost his popularity among the russian population .
the marathon session lasted more than three hours during which putin answered questions ranging from everyday issues to global politics , which were asked in advance via text messages , a special website and on free phone numbers .
while answering questions on inflation and job losses , putin said inflation would rise beyond the government 's targeted level , ria novosti news agency reported .

this year 's inflation will be around 13 per cent " , he said .

putin said up to 5 trillion rubles -lrb- $ 178.9 billion -rrb- was set to help the banking system through the economic crisis .
" we are working with banks that will not waste your money , " he said , and promised that there would be no sudden devaluation of the ruble .
" if needed , -lrb- we -rrb- will carefully use gold and foreign exchange reserves and other government funds as we did before , " putin said .

the language center attributes the shrinking popularity of german to television ; teachers and students are bored by the many documentary films made about hitler and the nazi era .
blame it on hitler ?
" i 've heard german teachers say , ' not another film about hitler ! " '
cilt spokeswoman teresa tinsley told the media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all those nazi documentaries bore students on the other hand , the language center attributes the growing popularity of spanish to the emergence of hollywood stars like antonio banderas and penélope cruz , not to mention the fact that spain is a popular vacation destination for the british .
some 56,900 students are registered for spanish - up 10,000 from seven years ago .
more schools offer spanish last year was the first time the number of schools offering spanish surpassed the number of those offering german .
but there was only a slight difference between the two figures .
in 2008 , however , the gap widened .
three quarters of all british schools offer spanish , while only two-thirds offer german .
three years ago , only half the schools offered spanish as a second language . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .
france heading for recession in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants money to help the french car industry france has so far narrowly escaped the tide of recession stalking the industrialized world but the oecd forecasts it can not avoid it next year , with the economy contracting 0.4 percent .
sarkozy 's plan comes on the heels of a 20-billion-euro strategic investment fund launched last month to shield french industry from foreign predators .
the european commission last week called for an overall package for the eu worth 200 billion euros , drawn from national plans and eu funds , to snap europe 's economy out of recession through spending hikes and tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .
france heading for recession in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants money to help the french car industry france has so far narrowly escaped the tide of recession stalking the industrialized world but the oecd forecasts it can not avoid it next year , with the economy contracting 0.4 percent .
sarkozy 's plan comes on the heels of a 20-billion-euro strategic investment fund launched last month to shield french industry from foreign predators .
the european commission last week called for an overall package for the eu worth 200 billion euros , drawn from national plans and eu funds , to snap europe 's economy out of recession through spending hikes and tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .

demanding that the legislation be reviewed in 2014 , italy could slow europe ’ s race to fight climate change . " we have agreement on everything except the deletion of the review clause , " the european parliament 's lead negotiator claude turmes said on thursday , dec .
4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pushed hard for more biofuel " the negotiations were not concluded today because of one country , italy , trying to destabilize the renewables directive in the interest of its large energy companies and against the interest of european citizens , the economy and the climate , " said greenpeace campaigner frauke thies .
the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .
the eu 's overall target of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 was also firmed up and the member states must now roll out detailed road maps on how to reach their national targets for green energy . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" she is remorseless and encourages a high standard and brings out the best in artists , " said kasper könig , spokesperson for the finding committee that nominated christov-bakargiev for one of the most prestigious art jobs in germany .
a renowned art fest , the documenta is held every five years in the northern state of hessen .
the exhibition 's 13th installation will begin in june 2012 , and while christov-bakargiev calls the appointment " a blessing and a challenge , " it is only the latest in a series of major art projects for the new jersey native .
based in rome , turin and new york , christov-bakargiev is currently the chief curator at the castello di rivoli museum of contemporary art in turin , and after wrapping up the 16th sydney biennale in australia , she told deutsche welle that she is excited to tackle the documenta 13 running from june 9th to september 16th , 2012 in kassel .
free rein for documenta " the artistic direction of documenta is a wonderful opportunity where you are given the possibility of realizing your vision in whatever way you see fit , " she explains .
" and it is a very big responsibility because it is the most historically renowned of the contemporary international art exhibitions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta curators have free rein at the exhibition and while hessen state minister silke lautenschlaeger believes christov-bakargiev " will give the documenta bright new impulses , " the 51-year old curator never loses sight of one particular perspective when it comes to her field .
" i strongly believe that the members of the audience , the visitors , are the center of the art experience , " she says .
christov-bakargiev , who graduated from the university of pisa , faculty of leggers and philosophy , is also a writer and has published a book exclusively on the arte povera movement .

demanding that the legislation be reviewed in 2014 , italy could slow europe ’ s race to fight climate change . " we have agreement on everything except the deletion of the review clause , " the european parliament 's lead negotiator claude turmes said on thursday , dec .
4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .
the eu 's overall target of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 was also firmed up and the member states must now roll out detailed road maps on how to reach their national targets for green energy . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .
secularism is taken very seriously in the country 's state schools , and in 2004 a law was passed that bans pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at school .

can germans protect themselvs ?
germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .
but norbert walter , chief economist at deutsch bank , has warned that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink up to 4 percent in 2009 .
" it 's around a 33 percent chance that that will happen , " he told german daily newspaper bild .
that would represent the worst crisis since the federal republic of germany was founded .
the best-case scenario would see gdp shrink 1 percent .
russia , mideast knock-on effect walter said one possible cause for the massive drop in output could be the flow-on effect of poor economic conditions in russia and the middle east .
he recommended that the government lower value-added tax " immediately and for one year " to 16 percent , in order to boost domestic consumer spending .
" otherwise , there is nothing to stop a major crash , " he told the paper .
industry 's back to the wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all major german industrial groups reported fewer orders in october further complicating matters for germany is that exports - usually the nation 's economic ace in the hole - have fallen across the board .
the ministry for economics and technology said german industrial order books contracted by a hefty and far bigger-than-expected 6.1 percent month on month in october after shrinking by a revised 8.3 percent in september . " what started off as a relatively normal correction -lrb- in new orders -rrb- from very high levels has developed into a serious collapse , " said ing economist carsten brzeski . " with emerging market growth slowing down and a recession in the industrialized world , the near term outlook for german industry looks anything but rosy , " he said . luxury carmaker bmw reported friday that sales plummeted by 25 percent in november to 96,570 vehicles . consumers increasingly skeptical meanwhile , germans are becoming increasingly worried about a major recession , recent studies show .
nearly three quarters of those asked in a study published thursday , dec .
4 , were sure that " the worst part of the crisis still lies ahead , " according to the study 's organizers , ard deutschlandtrend .
that represents a 10 point increase from a month earlier .
also , half of respondents were worried about their personal future .
the european central bank is also pessimistic about 2009 .
on thursday , they lowered growth forecasts for this year and next .
gdp in the eurozone is expected to drop 0.5 percent in 2009 , european central bank jean claude trichet said thursday , explaining his decision to slash interest rates . dw staff -lrb- jen / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.12.2008 traumatic impact of mumbai attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychologists worry that the traumatic images of the mumbai blasts could have a lasting impact on children last week ’ s terror attacks in india 's commercial hub mumbai are over , but the shocking images played out on television for three continuous days have made psychiatrists fear the impact on children .
specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .
now that the initial and acute shock has passed , they say , the post-terror trauma could well start to sink in . murali krishnan 05/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 china the chinese artist and civil rights activist ai weiwei was put under house arrest on friday .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .
now that the initial and acute shock has passed , they say , the post-terror trauma could well start to sink in . murali krishnan 05/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 interview suu kyi calls for more support from europe the burmese civil rights activist talks to dw in an exclusive interview .

" i strongly believe that the members of the audience , the visitors , are the center of the art experience , " she says .
christov-bakargiev , who graduated from the university of pisa , faculty of leggers and philosophy , is also a writer and has published a book exclusively on the arte povera movement .
when asked if her extroverted style , visible in her fiery red hair and matching glasses , will be noticeable in the exhibition , the wife and mother of two says , " i ca n't hide my personality , that 's for sure . "
christov-bakargiev intends to return to kassel in january and spend a lot of time in hessen as she prepares the documenta . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .
france heading for recession in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants money to help the french car industry france has so far narrowly escaped the tide of recession stalking the industrialized world but the oecd forecasts it can not avoid it next year , with the economy contracting 0.4 percent .
sarkozy 's plan comes on the heels of a 20-billion-euro strategic investment fund launched last month to shield french industry from foreign predators .
the european commission last week called for an overall package for the eu worth 200 billion euros , drawn from national plans and eu funds , to snap europe 's economy out of recession through spending hikes and tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .

can germans protect themselvs ?
germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .
but norbert walter , chief economist at deutsch bank , has warned that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink up to 4 percent in 2009 .
" it 's around a 33 percent chance that that will happen , " he told german daily newspaper bild .
that would represent the worst crisis since the federal republic of germany was founded .
the best-case scenario would see gdp shrink 1 percent .
russia , mideast knock-on effect walter said one possible cause for the massive drop in output could be the flow-on effect of poor economic conditions in russia and the middle east .
he recommended that the government lower value-added tax " immediately and for one year " to 16 percent , in order to boost domestic consumer spending .
" otherwise , there is nothing to stop a major crash , " he told the paper .
industry 's back to the wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all major german industrial groups reported fewer orders in october further complicating matters for germany is that exports - usually the nation 's economic ace in the hole - have fallen across the board .
the ministry for economics and technology said german industrial order books contracted by a hefty and far bigger-than-expected 6.1 percent month on month in october after shrinking by a revised 8.3 percent in september . " what started off as a relatively normal correction -lrb- in new orders -rrb- from very high levels has developed into a serious collapse , " said ing economist carsten brzeski . " with emerging market growth slowing down and a recession in the industrialized world , the near term outlook for german industry looks anything but rosy , " he said . luxury carmaker bmw reported friday that sales plummeted by 25 percent in november to 96,570 vehicles . consumers increasingly skeptical meanwhile , germans are becoming increasingly worried about a major recession , recent studies show .
nearly three quarters of those asked in a study published thursday , dec .
4 , were sure that " the worst part of the crisis still lies ahead , " according to the study 's organizers , ard deutschlandtrend .
that represents a 10 point increase from a month earlier .
also , half of respondents were worried about their personal future .
the european central bank is also pessimistic about 2009 .
on thursday , they lowered growth forecasts for this year and next .
gdp in the eurozone is expected to drop 0.5 percent in 2009 , european central bank jean claude trichet said thursday , explaining his decision to slash interest rates . dw staff -lrb- jen / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.12.2008 sarkozy announces 26-billion-euro stimulus plan for france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy will go to the state for the money to help france president nicolas sarkozy unveiled a 26-billion-euro stimulus plan on thursday , dec.4 to help france fight a global slowdown with massive state investment and aid for the struggling car industry . france 's contribution to a europe-wide economic revival drive , the plan combines big state infrastructure projects such as four new high-speed tgv train lines with measures to shore up hard-hit businesses and boost housing .
" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .
france heading for recession in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants money to help the french car industry france has so far narrowly escaped the tide of recession stalking the industrialized world but the oecd forecasts it can not avoid it next year , with the economy contracting 0.4 percent .
sarkozy 's plan comes on the heels of a 20-billion-euro strategic investment fund launched last month to shield french industry from foreign predators .
the european commission last week called for an overall package for the eu worth 200 billion euros , drawn from national plans and eu funds , to snap europe 's economy out of recession through spending hikes and tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .
the total price paid by lufthansa is expected to come to 377 million euros after the airline offered to buy out all other shareholders for 4.44 euros per share , a pitch worth 215 million euros .
one condition for the sale was that the eu approves a 500-million-euro cash injection from the austrian government for restructuring .
oelag was told by the austrian government it had no choice but to sell the stake to lufthansa .
" the partnership with lufthansa guarantees not only the continuation of the brand and employment at aua but also assures long-term access to vital international passengers , " head of the holding group peter michaelis said in a statement .
russian airline s7 and air france-klm had also expressed interest in acquiring the government stake in aua , but in november oelag announced it would negotiate exclusively with lufthansa .
aua is forecast to lose up to 125 million euros this year , but said that " special items " could bring the figure up to 475 million euros . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pushed hard for more biofuel " the negotiations were not concluded today because of one country , italy , trying to destabilize the renewables directive in the interest of its large energy companies and against the interest of european citizens , the economy and the climate , " said greenpeace campaigner frauke thies .
the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .
the eu 's overall target of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 was also firmed up and the member states must now roll out detailed road maps on how to reach their national targets for green energy . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .
the total price paid by lufthansa is expected to come to 377 million euros after the airline offered to buy out all other shareholders for 4.44 euros per share , a pitch worth 215 million euros .
one condition for the sale was that the eu approves a 500-million-euro cash injection from the austrian government for restructuring .
oelag was told by the austrian government it had no choice but to sell the stake to lufthansa .
" the partnership with lufthansa guarantees not only the continuation of the brand and employment at aua but also assures long-term access to vital international passengers , " head of the holding group peter michaelis said in a statement .
russian airline s7 and air france-klm had also expressed interest in acquiring the government stake in aua , but in november oelag announced it would negotiate exclusively with lufthansa .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

the approval of the plan will be greeted as good news by carmakers , which have seen overall output and sales drop dramatically in recent months as consumers tighten their purse strings .
but critics say chancellor angela merkel 's government has not gone far enough with the package .
pressure has mounted on merkel to allow cuts to value-added tax , as has been done in the uk , in an effort to motivate consumers into spending more .
but merkel said this week that the german government " will not join in a multibillion -lrb- euro -rrb- race simply to create the impression that we have done something . "
the government said the package would generate an additional 50 billion euros in investment for germany .
industry creaks as the packaged was cleared by the upper house of parliament friday , dec .
5 , data released the same day showed that factory orders across germany have plunged .
with a grim roll call of economic indicators from around the world pointing to a global recession taking hold , the data showed domestic industrial orders fell by 6.1 percent in october , while foreign orders fell by 6.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sales are down across the board in germany " all industrial groups reported lower orders in october compared to the previous month , " the ministry for economics and technology said , releasing the latest order book data .
also friday , the bundesbank said germany - the world 's leading export nation - could expect further export falls of 0.5 percent in 2009 .
credit harder to come by up until recently there had been signs that german businesses had managed to avoid the credit squeeze unleashed by the us subprime mortgage market crisis . but a survey released by the german ifo economics institute friday pointed to companies facing growing problems in arranging financing amid the deepening sense of gloom about the economic outlook . about one third of the 4,000 companies responding to the survey reported a growing reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , ifo chief hans-werner sinn said releasing the survey . " in particular , large companies have been complaining that credit lines are restrictive , " said sinn .
but sinn said he did not believe german companies were facing a credit squeeze , rather he said he saw higher hurdles to arranging credit . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .
the total price paid by lufthansa is expected to come to 377 million euros after the airline offered to buy out all other shareholders for 4.44 euros per share , a pitch worth 215 million euros .
one condition for the sale was that the eu approves a 500-million-euro cash injection from the austrian government for restructuring .
oelag was told by the austrian government it had no choice but to sell the stake to lufthansa .
" the partnership with lufthansa guarantees not only the continuation of the brand and employment at aua but also assures long-term access to vital international passengers , " head of the holding group peter michaelis said in a statement .
russian airline s7 and air france-klm had also expressed interest in acquiring the government stake in aua , but in november oelag announced it would negotiate exclusively with lufthansa .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

in the past , both countries had to agree that fraud had occurred before a prosecution could be launched , he said . " from now on , fraud only needs to be recognized by us law , " hohenberg explained .
in the past , the us has also had to prove a deliberate tax fraud , a high standard that means liechtenstein bank accounts have been essentially impenetrable to outsiders .
but although the principality is under constant international pressure to revisit its secrecy laws and anonymous foundations , " it would be false to say we have given up banking secrecy , " hohenberg emphasized .
prince nikolaus , a member of liechtenstein ruling royal family who brokered the deal , stated that while he was willing to grant similar concessions within the european union , he requires double-taxation agreements and a commitment by countries to deal leniently with citizens that had hidden money from tax authorities in liechtenstein .
cooperation essential " we accept that more cooperation is necessary because there is more acute pressure , " he said .
" it is of high political importance to many countries .
money is a rare species for states - they need every penny . "

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .
opposition denounces government 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal and the socialists have slammed the plan the measures were denounced by the opposition socialists as merely recycling projects already planned .
the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .
a mix of tax breaks and other incentives for businesses worth 700 million euros were rolled out to encourage job creation after recent data confirmed france had crossed the threshold of two million jobless in october .
sarkozy targets auto and industrial bailouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will face recession later than others sarkozy unveiled targeted measures worth 1.5 billion euros for the car and construction industries , which together account for about four million french jobs and have been hardest hit by the downturn .
a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .
france heading for recession in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants money to help the french car industry france has so far narrowly escaped the tide of recession stalking the industrialized world but the oecd forecasts it can not avoid it next year , with the economy contracting 0.4 percent .
sarkozy 's plan comes on the heels of a 20-billion-euro strategic investment fund launched last month to shield french industry from foreign predators .
the european commission last week called for an overall package for the eu worth 200 billion euros , drawn from national plans and eu funds , to snap europe 's economy out of recession through spending hikes and tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the administrative court ruled thursday , dec .

judge wilfried hamm gave no further explanation for his ruling .
vows to appeal decision solms-baruth has vowed to appeal the decision all the way to the european court of human rights .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's meeting room was destroyed in the attack , but the dictator was unscathed asked on wednesday what he would do if he lost , the prince told dpa news service that he would " if necessary , take the case to the european court of human rights , as the case is fundamentally an issue of human rights and democracy .

the administrative court ruled thursday , dec .
4 against returning the land to solms-baruth , saying that he was not owed any compensation .
judge wilfried hamm gave no further explanation for his ruling .
vows to appeal decision solms-baruth has vowed to appeal the decision all the way to the european court of human rights .
he claimed that after german reunification , his own father had " fought the german authorities tirelessly for restitution of the family 's estates and property - until his death in january 2006 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's meeting room was destroyed in the attack , but the dictator was unscathed asked on wednesday what he would do if he lost , the prince told dpa news service that he would " if necessary , take the case to the european court of human rights , as the case is fundamentally an issue of human rights and democracy . "
" what we are dealing with here is stolen property which needs to be returned .
no victim would allow a thief to keep what he has stolen - especially when it is the state which stands to benefit from a crime from which claims to protect its citizens , " he told dpa .
valkyrie film creates renewed interest the prince claims the nazis stripped his late grandfather , the third prince of solms-baruth , of his rights of ownership over his company and estates in brandenburg in the wake of the july 1944 bid to kill hitler .
the case comes amid a renewed focus in recent months on the bomb plot , which was led by col. claus graf schenk von stauffenberg , in part because of the upcoming tom cruise film " valkyrie " based on the event .
cruise plays the aristocratic colonel in the film .
von stauffenberg placed the bomb in a conference room where hitler was meeting with his aides and military advisers , but the dictator excaped with scrapes and bruises .
many plotters were arrested and executed in revenge killings that saw some hanged by the neck with piano wire .
solms-baruth 's grandfather , a long-time anti-nazi , was involved in discussions of the plot and provided two of his mansions as meeting places .
later he stayed at castle hega , the home of the crown princess of sweden in stockholm , before leaving europe to move to namibia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's around a 33 percent chance that that will happen , " he told german daily newspaper bild .
that would represent the worst crisis since the federal republic of germany was founded .

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .

demanding that the legislation be reviewed in 2014 , italy could slow europe ’ s race to fight climate change . " we have agreement on everything except the deletion of the review clause , " the european parliament 's lead negotiator claude turmes said on thursday , dec .
4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pushed hard for more biofuel " the negotiations were not concluded today because of one country , italy , trying to destabilize the renewables directive in the interest of its large energy companies and against the interest of european citizens , the economy and the climate , " said greenpeace campaigner frauke thies .
the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .
the eu 's overall target of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 was also firmed up and the member states must now roll out detailed road maps on how to reach their national targets for green energy . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the approval of the plan will be greeted as good news by carmakers , which have seen overall output and sales drop dramatically in recent months as consumers tighten their purse strings .
but critics say chancellor angela merkel 's government has not gone far enough with the package .
pressure has mounted on merkel to allow cuts to value-added tax , as has been done in the uk , in an effort to motivate consumers into spending more .
but merkel said this week that the german government " will not join in a multibillion -lrb- euro -rrb- race simply to create the impression that we have done something . "

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .
the total price paid by lufthansa is expected to come to 377 million euros after the airline offered to buy out all other shareholders for 4.44 euros per share , a pitch worth 215 million euros .
one condition for the sale was that the eu approves a 500-million-euro cash injection from the austrian government for restructuring .
oelag was told by the austrian government it had no choice but to sell the stake to lufthansa .
" the partnership with lufthansa guarantees not only the continuation of the brand and employment at aua but also assures long-term access to vital international passengers , " head of the holding group peter michaelis said in a statement .
russian airline s7 and air france-klm had also expressed interest in acquiring the government stake in aua , but in november oelag announced it would negotiate exclusively with lufthansa .
aua is forecast to lose up to 125 million euros this year , but said that " special items " could bring the figure up to 475 million euros . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .

for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .

in the past , both countries had to agree that fraud had occurred before a prosecution could be launched , he said . " from now on , fraud only needs to be recognized by us law , " hohenberg explained .
in the past , the us has also had to prove a deliberate tax fraud , a high standard that means liechtenstein bank accounts have been essentially impenetrable to outsiders .
but although the principality is under constant international pressure to revisit its secrecy laws and anonymous foundations , " it would be false to say we have given up banking secrecy , " hohenberg emphasized .
prince nikolaus , a member of liechtenstein ruling royal family who brokered the deal , stated that while he was willing to grant similar concessions within the european union , he requires double-taxation agreements and a commitment by countries to deal leniently with citizens that had hidden money from tax authorities in liechtenstein .
cooperation essential " we accept that more cooperation is necessary because there is more acute pressure , " he said .
" it is of high political importance to many countries .
money is a rare species for states - they need every penny . "

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .

the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .

but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

the administrative court ruled thursday , dec .
4 against returning the land to solms-baruth , saying that he was not owed any compensation .
judge wilfried hamm gave no further explanation for his ruling .
vows to appeal decision solms-baruth has vowed to appeal the decision all the way to the european court of human rights .
he claimed that after german reunification , his own father had " fought the german authorities tirelessly for restitution of the family 's estates and property - until his death in january 2006 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's meeting room was destroyed in the attack , but the dictator was unscathed asked on wednesday what he would do if he lost , the prince told dpa news service that he would " if necessary , take the case to the european court of human rights , as the case is fundamentally an issue of human rights and democracy . "
" what we are dealing with here is stolen property which needs to be returned .
no victim would allow a thief to keep what he has stolen - especially when it is the state which stands to benefit from a crime from which claims to protect its citizens , " he told dpa .
valkyrie film creates renewed interest the prince claims the nazis stripped his late grandfather , the third prince of solms-baruth , of his rights of ownership over his company and estates in brandenburg in the wake of the july 1944 bid to kill hitler .
the case comes amid a renewed focus in recent months on the bomb plot , which was led by col. claus graf schenk von stauffenberg , in part because of the upcoming tom cruise film " valkyrie " based on the event .
cruise plays the aristocratic colonel in the film .
von stauffenberg placed the bomb in a conference room where hitler was meeting with his aides and military advisers , but the dictator excaped with scrapes and bruises .
many plotters were arrested and executed in revenge killings that saw some hanged by the neck with piano wire .
solms-baruth 's grandfather , a long-time anti-nazi , was involved in discussions of the plot and provided two of his mansions as meeting places .
later he stayed at castle hega , the home of the crown princess of sweden in stockholm , before leaving europe to move to namibia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

demanding that the legislation be reviewed in 2014 , italy could slow europe ’ s race to fight climate change . " we have agreement on everything except the deletion of the review clause , " the european parliament 's lead negotiator claude turmes said on thursday , dec .
4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .

greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

" in particular , large companies have been complaining that credit lines are restrictive , " said sinn .
but sinn said he did not believe german companies were facing a credit squeeze , rather he said he saw higher hurdles to arranging credit . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pushed hard for more biofuel " the negotiations were not concluded today because of one country , italy , trying to destabilize the renewables directive in the interest of its large energy companies and against the interest of european citizens , the economy and the climate , " said greenpeace campaigner frauke thies .
the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .

can germans protect themselvs ?
germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .
but norbert walter , chief economist at deutsch bank , has warned that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink up to 4 percent in 2009 .
" it 's around a 33 percent chance that that will happen , " he told german daily newspaper bild .
that would represent the worst crisis since the federal republic of germany was founded .
the best-case scenario would see gdp shrink 1 percent .
russia , mideast knock-on effect walter said one possible cause for the massive drop in output could be the flow-on effect of poor economic conditions in russia and the middle east .
he recommended that the government lower value-added tax " immediately and for one year " to 16 percent , in order to boost domestic consumer spending .
" otherwise , there is nothing to stop a major crash , " he told the paper .
industry 's back to the wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all major german industrial groups reported fewer orders in october further complicating matters for germany is that exports - usually the nation 's economic ace in the hole - have fallen across the board .
the ministry for economics and technology said german industrial order books contracted by a hefty and far bigger-than-expected 6.1 percent month on month in october after shrinking by a revised 8.3 percent in september . " what started off as a relatively normal correction -lrb- in new orders -rrb- from very high levels has developed into a serious collapse , " said ing economist carsten brzeski . " with emerging market growth slowing down and a recession in the industrialized world , the near term outlook for german industry looks anything but rosy , " he said . luxury carmaker bmw reported friday that sales plummeted by 25 percent in november to 96,570 vehicles . consumers increasingly skeptical meanwhile , germans are becoming increasingly worried about a major recession , recent studies show .
nearly three quarters of those asked in a study published thursday , dec .
4 , were sure that " the worst part of the crisis still lies ahead , " according to the study 's organizers , ard deutschlandtrend .
that represents a 10 point increase from a month earlier .
also , half of respondents were worried about their personal future .
the european central bank is also pessimistic about 2009 .
on thursday , they lowered growth forecasts for this year and next .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .
secularism is taken very seriously in the country 's state schools , and in 2004 a law was passed that bans pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at school .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.12.2008 financial crisis pressures german incumbents , boosts opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the crisis has n't toppled the cdu .
but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .

but merkel 's stock is down the political fallout from the international financial crisis continues .
angela merkel is getting pounded for her reticence , and her coalition partners are suffering too .
opponents , however , are making hay . a recent survey shows that germans are rapidly losing confidence in chancellor angela merkel 's ability to lead europe 's largest economy through difficult times .
in an extraordinary popularity turnaround , a poll taken for the ard television network on thursday , dec .
4 , found only 52 percent now believe the chancellor " will ensure an economic upturn in germany . "
that 's a steep 17-point drop over the last year , during which the christian democrat chancellor has faced sharp criticism of her crisis management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer could wave ' hello ' to new votes if his tax-cut idea takes hold merkel 's overall favorable rating fell six points to 65 percent in december from a month ago , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rival to merkel in next september 's election , saw his rating up 6 points to 74 .
incumbent spd suffers , too but the spd party as a whole , which shares power with the cdu in the current government , is also being snubbed by voters .
germans vote for parties and do not directly elect their leaders .
the ard survey found merkel 's cdu has a comfortable 14-point lead over steinmeier 's spd .
despite merkel 's poor image , the poll found the cdu would receive 37 percent of the vote , unchanged from november , while steinmeier 's spd fell two points to 23 percent in the last month to the lowest level since august 2004 .
merkel has said she wants to wait until after the election in september before lowering taxes , even though other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies .
bavarian premier calls for tax cut her stance has been met with an uproar from politicians and observers both within her party and without .
many obervers have said it makes little sense to rule out tax cuts now , as the crisis unfolds , yet promise them later on .
horst seehofer , chairman of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , is among the ranks of politicians distancing himself from merkel .
he urged her to act swiftly to lower taxes and stimulate economic growth , rather than wait until it is too late .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberal fdp has seen a boost amid the crisis " action is needed now to avoid unemployment and plants closing down , " seehofer told bild newspaper on friday , extending the string of warnings that taken to unleashing on merkel via the media .
missing a major meeting merkel has faced withering criticism across europe and even in the cdu and csu for her cautious response to the global economic crisis while other nations have moved more aggressively to underpin their economies with stimulus measures .
she has even had to sit by and watch while france , britain and the european commission hold a high-profile meeting on the global economy next week without her .
london announced on thursday that british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso would meet european business leaders on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has benefited , but his party has not germany - europe 's largest economy - was not on the guest list , and some believe the omission was a response to merkel 's isolationist approach .
germany denies snub but germany denied it had been left out as a punishment for its reticent policies .
" the meeting is not directed against germany or the chancellor , " government spokesman thomas steg told news services , when repeatedly pressed on the issue at a news conference .
" we were informed about the meeting so we were not surprised when reports came out about it , " he said .
but the talks on a coordinated response to the economic situation risk deepening the divisions over the european commission 's 200 billion euros spending plan to ease the effects of the recession - which merkel has reservations about .

the german carrier announced wednesday its plans to take a 100 percent stake in its smaller austrian rival , first through the privatization and then through buying free-floating shares .
the total price paid by lufthansa is expected to come to 377 million euros after the airline offered to buy out all other shareholders for 4.44 euros per share , a pitch worth 215 million euros .
one condition for the sale was that the eu approves a 500-million-euro cash injection from the austrian government for restructuring .
oelag was told by the austrian government it had no choice but to sell the stake to lufthansa .
" the partnership with lufthansa guarantees not only the continuation of the brand and employment at aua but also assures long-term access to vital international passengers , " head of the holding group peter michaelis said in a statement .
russian airline s7 and air france-klm had also expressed interest in acquiring the government stake in aua , but in november oelag announced it would negotiate exclusively with lufthansa .
aua is forecast to lose up to 125 million euros this year , but said that " special items " could bring the figure up to 475 million euros . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .

specialists have sprung into action , taking distressed calls and making emergency visits to foreigners , youngsters and the parents of disturbed school children . flames leaping out of the windows of a hotel , sounds of loud explosions and gunfire , people ducking in fear as grenades burst and commandos launching operations - these disturbing images that flashed on television for nearly 60 hours non-stop have taken their toll on many impressionable minds .
the terror assault in mumbai , which happened last week when a group of 10 militants laid siege to high-profile targets , including the oberoi trident and taj hotels , shocked many citizens because of its sheer brazenness .
most parents watched the dramatic unfolding of the attacks live on television without thinking of the impact on their children , who were spellbound too and picked up a new set of phrases and words .
horrendous images with lasting impact although many indian children have become inured to pictures of bomb blasts and of injured people being carried to hospitals in india and other countries over the years , the images of raging gun battles between terrorists and commandos for so long were new .
“ actually , it ’ s had a terrible impact already , ” explains dr promilla bhutani who is a child specialist .
she says that in her clinic many children get up with nightmares .
“ this is a reality one has to face that one can not depict such things - they are not for general viewing . ”
the “ horrendous pictures ” have had the “ most terrible impact on youngsters from three to 14 .
it ’ s a horrific experience . ”
free counselling for the traumatised hospitals in mumbai say they will offer free treatment , psychological counselling and basic diagnostic services to anybody traumatised by the live images of the attack .
calls are already pouring in .
specialists explain that the symptoms of post-terror trauma can include numbness , guilt , a refusal to make eye contact and even an unwillingness to speak to loved ones .
the impact on “ impressionable minds ” can be very long-lasting says dr anandi lal , a psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro-sciences : “ it can lead to insecurities , depression and clingy behaviour .
these sorts of things happen because of these images .
generally children outgrow these things but some of these children will bear the impact through their adulthood . ”
psychiatrists and counsellors are stressing the importance of counselling at this point , especially since this particular attack in mumbai was so severe and went on for such a long period of time , in contrast to past terror attacks .

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .

a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .

4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .

the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .

demanding that the legislation be reviewed in 2014 , italy could slow europe ’ s race to fight climate change . " we have agreement on everything except the deletion of the review clause , " the european parliament 's lead negotiator claude turmes said on thursday , dec .
4 following extensive closed-door talks .
the debate surrounding biofuels flared up in january when the european commission proposed that 10 percent of road transport fuel should come from renewable resources by the year 2020 .
biofuels would comprise a large portion of such resources , meaning that a large market currently coveted by exporters such as brazil and indonesia would be opened up .
environmentalists have opposed this move , claiming that biofuels made from grains and oilseeds were driving food prices higher and causing famers to expand their farms by infringing upon rainforests and wetlands .
the conflict over biofuels has been resolved with an agreement that up to almost one-third of the eu 's 10 percent goal would be met through electric cars and trains , not biofuels .
" the 10 percent agri-fuels target has been seriously undermined , " commented turmes .
italy could slow progress but the larger point of contention following the closed talks was italy 's insistence to review the agreement in 2014 , a move which according to turmes could undermine investment security and put thousands of new jobs at risk .
environmental groups also criticized italy 's proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pushed hard for more biofuel " the negotiations were not concluded today because of one country , italy , trying to destabilize the renewables directive in the interest of its large energy companies and against the interest of european citizens , the economy and the climate , " said greenpeace campaigner frauke thies .
the green energy laws are a significant part of an eu package to fight climate change , emphasized british climate minister ed miliband .
" europe faces a moment of truth over the next week on the issue of climate change as to whether this package goes through and goes through with environmental integrity , " he said .
the eu 's overall target of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 was also firmed up and the member states must now roll out detailed road maps on how to reach their national targets for green energy . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .
secularism is taken very seriously in the country 's state schools , and in 2004 a law was passed that bans pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at school .

the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .

germany 's central bank predicted friday that europe 's largest economy would shrink by 0.8 percent next year , but economists believe it could get much worse than that . in its biennial report , the bundesbank said the " prospects for the german economy have worsened notably since the beginning of the autumn . " the central bank had already predicted the german economy would continue shrinking in 2009 - after it sank into recession in this year 's third quarter - but had not said by how much . the bank said it did not expect the german economy to pick up again until 2010 when it should grow by around 1.2 percent . dire predictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's walter made a plea for tax cuts erring on the side of optimism , the government maintains the economy will still expand next year , albeit by only 0.2 percent .
but norbert walter , chief economist at deutsch bank , has warned that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink up to 4 percent in 2009 .
" it 's around a 33 percent chance that that will happen , " he told german daily newspaper bild .
that would represent the worst crisis since the federal republic of germany was founded .
the best-case scenario would see gdp shrink 1 percent .
russia , mideast knock-on effect walter said one possible cause for the massive drop in output could be the flow-on effect of poor economic conditions in russia and the middle east .

" our answer to the crisis is a massive investment drive because that is the best way to support businesses and to protect jobs , " sarkozy said during a trip to douai in northern france , home to a major renault car factory .
but economists questioned how much of the money announced was new and how much was simply existing budget allocations re-packaged as stimulus funds .
" this is relatively limited and fairly defensive .
i do n't have the impression that we 're really trying to have a turnaround but that we 're trying to stop the economy from collapsing , " said olivier gasnier of bnp paribas bank .
the economist thomas piketty said the problem was that the " government does n't have any more money " and calculated that " new spending " among the measures announced by sarkozy amounted to no more than three billion euros .

the party 's segolene royal said they were " mini-measures that were not adequate for the scale of the problem . "
sarkozy announced a total of 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in state investments , bringing forward four billion euros of scheduled projects on top of four billion euros for the state energy , transport and postal companies .
to improve business cashflows , sarkozy said the state would speed up the repayment of sales tax and of tax refunds for research and development investments in a package of measures worth 11 billion euros .

a 300-million-euro restructuring fund for the car industry , notably car parts suppliers , was unveiled along with a bonus of 1,000 euros for car owners who scrap their old vehicle to buy an energy-efficient new one .
the french state will also provide a one-billion-euro loan facility to support national champions renault and peugeot , which have announced thousands of job cuts amid a collapse in sales .
for struggling construction firms , sarkozy announced plans to build 100,000 new social housing units , support energy-efficient property renovation work and to double the number of zero-percent property loans .
the lowest-income french families were also set to receive a one-off " bonus " of 200 euros to boost flagging consumer spending .
the plan , worth 26 billion euros in all , will put government finances further in the red by 15 billion euros , with the public deficit set to climb to four percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent european benchmark , officials said .

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .

" we were close to getting a political declaration , probably closer than we have been for many years , but no cigar this time , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the osce 's rotating chairmanship . as outgoing chairman of the 56-nation grouping , finland had hoped that ministers for the first time in six years would agree on a joint declaration .
decisions in the osce hinge on unanimity , and previous meetings have failed to bridge differences to agree on such a document .
stubb underlined the role of osce in conflict resolution , citing its part along with the european union in brokering a ceasefire after the recent war between russia and georgia .
greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , who january 1 takes over the chairmanship , said " the aftermath of the crisis " was a priority for greece and she planned to visit the region soon .
multiple countries urged the osce to extend the monitoring mission to georgia and its breakaway regions .
the mission is set to expire at the end of december .
georgian foreign minister ekaterine tkeshelashvili told reporters on the sidelines that she hoped for an extension but declined to predict the outcome of pending talks in moscow .
russia criticizes osce for inaction in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said the osce did n't do enough to stop georgia as the talks leaned towards the georgia conflict , russia slammed the osce for failing to prevent the war , demanding an inquiry to determine why it did not act and insisting on the need for a new european security pact .
" it is clear that the osce has not met its main aim : to ensure safety for all , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in helsinki .
lavrov said osce observers deployed in south ossetia had warned their superiors of a georgian attack in august but the information was not transmitted to all of the organization 's member states .
he also noted that russia had for several years warned of arms shipments to tbilisi .
the organization " did not react to the illegal use of force , " he said .
" it 's totally unacceptable .
i expect an inquiry to be carried out and the results to be presented to us , " lavrov said .
in an interview thursday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted to reporters that osce observers had warned of a deterioration of the georgian situation , and said the " early warning systems " had not functioned properly .
" it never works , because you always wake up too late , and afterwards someone always says that there were warnings that it would happen .
well , yes , but we did n't believe it , " kouchner said .
lavrov 's attack came after russia had faced heavy western criticism on thursday , the first day of the osce meeting .
russia slammed by eu , us over excessive force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of reacting with excessive force the european union and the united states condemned what they called the excessive use of military force by moscow in georgia in august and its decision to recognize the independence of the georgian separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
they also called on russian troops to allow ceasefire observers to enter these territories .
us assistant secretary of state daniel fried called on russia to stop blocking international monitors from going into georgia 's separatist south ossetia region to assess reports of human rights abuses .
the monitors have been unable to return to the moscow-backed region since the war in august between russia and georgia , and human rights groups say that in their absence ethnic georgians are being harassed by the separatists .
" there is , unfortunately , a silence and darkness with respect to the international monitors that has descended on south ossetia , " fried told reporters .
" the solution is hardly to keep monitors out of south ossetia ...
russia has an obligation , since it controls this territory , to let in international observers . "
moscow calls for new european security pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov called for clear rules for european security lavrov responded to the criticism by calling for a summit to be held on a new european security pact to establish " clear game rules " for the continent amid what lavrov said was a crisis of confidence .
" there is a desire to find an agreement on clear game rules , to gradually restore confidence -lrb- in europe -rrb- , the crisis of which is the root of all problems , " he said .
lavrov also urged the osce to help avert a " humanitarian disaster " in south ossetia .
lavrov said the pact should " refute claims from some states who think they have an exclusive right to peacekeeping and security in the euro-atlantic zone , " a veiled reference to the united states .
" there are those who want to preserve everything as it was in the 1990s .
in other words , a group of countries that positions itself as the most advanced and civilized , determines and controls the direction of travel for the others , " he said .
he added all european countries and international organizations should join the pact .
osce members split over need for security summit the us and a number of european countries have already said a summit on reorganizing european security would be " premature . "
" there is a general sense that there is a need for discussion of some of the problems in european security , " daniel fried told journalists on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many osce members said nato does not need replacing " but there was strong sense in the room that the current institutions nato , the eu , and the osce itself have worked well and there is hardly a need to replace them . "
in november , french president nicolas sarkozy said he was in favor of such a summit in 2009 , but kouchner on thursday backtracked from that statement .
the foreign ministers of several former soviet states - armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrghyzstan , tajikistan and uzbekistan - on friday published a statement supporting the russian proposal .
several countries said the existing structures involving the eu , nato and osce were sufficient .
but they added there was need to refresh or strengthen those structures .
a possible meeting next year discussing the ideas was not ruled out by bakoyannis , but a summit appeared premature , she said .

the administrative court ruled thursday , dec .
4 against returning the land to solms-baruth , saying that he was not owed any compensation .
judge wilfried hamm gave no further explanation for his ruling .
vows to appeal decision solms-baruth has vowed to appeal the decision all the way to the european court of human rights .
he claimed that after german reunification , his own father had " fought the german authorities tirelessly for restitution of the family 's estates and property - until his death in january 2006 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's meeting room was destroyed in the attack , but the dictator was unscathed asked on wednesday what he would do if he lost , the prince told dpa news service that he would " if necessary , take the case to the european court of human rights , as the case is fundamentally an issue of human rights and democracy . "
" what we are dealing with here is stolen property which needs to be returned .
no victim would allow a thief to keep what he has stolen - especially when it is the state which stands to benefit from a crime from which claims to protect its citizens , " he told dpa .
valkyrie film creates renewed interest the prince claims the nazis stripped his late grandfather , the third prince of solms-baruth , of his rights of ownership over his company and estates in brandenburg in the wake of the july 1944 bid to kill hitler .
the case comes amid a renewed focus in recent months on the bomb plot , which was led by col. claus graf schenk von stauffenberg , in part because of the upcoming tom cruise film " valkyrie " based on the event .
cruise plays the aristocratic colonel in the film .
von stauffenberg placed the bomb in a conference room where hitler was meeting with his aides and military advisers , but the dictator excaped with scrapes and bruises .
many plotters were arrested and executed in revenge killings that saw some hanged by the neck with piano wire .
solms-baruth 's grandfather , a long-time anti-nazi , was involved in discussions of the plot and provided two of his mansions as meeting places .
later he stayed at castle hega , the home of the crown princess of sweden in stockholm , before leaving europe to move to namibia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling fuels the debate over secularism in france . the european court of human rights has dismissed a complaint by two french muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education .
the girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .
the teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes .
the girls , belgin dogru and esma-nur kervanci , are french nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of flers in 1999 .
for secularism 's sake based in strasbourg , the european court of human rights ruled on thursday , dec .
4 that the school 's move to expel the girls was not out of line , emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes .
" it was clear that the applicants ' religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order , " the court said in a press release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion has no place in france 's schools the court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants ' right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism , a hot topic of debate in france .

they have been told they will receive a letter before christmas confirming they should expect to be made redundant .
the total number of staff in the uk is around 800 and up to 200 others work for the team indirectly .
the honda motor company said it was pulling out of formula one because of the world financial crisis .
chief executive takeo fukui said that difficult business conditions had led to the decision to pull out of formula one racing .
the company also said it has no plans to continue as a supplier of engines for formula one cars .
team bosses ross brawn and nick fry fear honda could close the brackley-based team within weeks , according to the reuters news agency .
it is believed the team have enough money to continue to march , but have set a deadline of the end of january to find a buyer .
' stunning shock ' honda will assume the existing debts , and , it is understood , will sell the team for a nominal figure - perhaps as little as £ 1 , said bbc sport correspondent adam parsons .
honda have won only one race in the past three seasons and last year achieved only one podium position thanks to rubens barrichello .
jenson button is the other driver in the team .
the team 's total budget for the past year , including work done in britain and japan , is believed to be just short of $ 500m .

it is believed the team have enough money to continue to march , but have set a deadline of the end of january to find a buyer .
' stunning shock ' honda will assume the existing debts , and , it is understood , will sell the team for a nominal figure - perhaps as little as £ 1 , said bbc sport correspondent adam parsons .
honda have won only one race in the past three seasons and last year achieved only one podium position thanks to rubens barrichello .

the team 's total budget for the past year , including work done in britain and japan , is believed to be just short of $ 500m .
adam parsons said this was " a stunning shock " for motor racing .
he said honda was considered one of the best funded and most dedicated teams , despite its poor results .

not that coming out as gay in the rugby world was easy .
in his new autobiography , he details the fear he felt before taking the decision and how being gay drove him to attempt suicide as a young man .
raised in the village of mynyddcerrig in carmarthenshire , he made his rugby world cup debut last year , and is the first openly gay man to referee at the highest level .
hanner amser -lrb- half time -rrb- has just been published , but mr owens said he took some convincing to write it .
" when you do a book , especially an autobiography , you 've got to be honest about stuff , " he told bbc wales .
" i had an e-mail from a young guy off facebook who had gone through the same thing i had gone through - he was gay and could not tell his parents .
" but they found out through television that i was gay and their attitude towards gay people had changed .
" he felt more comfortable that he could tell them so he did so and was accepted pretty well . "
he told the jamie and louise programme : " i felt maybe if it helps someone along the way i would not like people to go through what i went through all those years ago . "
old fashioned mr owens said he was in his late teens or early twenties before he knew for certain he was gay .
" i was brought in a small community pretty much in an old fashioned way .
i was not really up to speed about what was going on in the modern world - coming from that sort of community .
" the long and short of it is i did not want to be gay .
i did not know what these feelings were at first - then realised what they were and thought ' i do not want to be like this . '
" it was in a time - 10 or 15 years ago - when it was n't as easy to be a gay person then as it is now .
not that it 's easy now , but it is more acceptable . "
as well as anecdotes from his upbringing and refereeing career mr owens talks about how being gay drove him to take an overdose and how if a police helicopter had not found him he would not be here today .
everybody from supporters to players to coaches to administrators have all been very supportive nigel owens , pictured refereeing england v new zealand " i was a person that i did not want to be - that 's what got me down .
i wanted a normal way of life , to get married and have children and stuff like that .
" looking back now i could have -lsb- told parents and friends -rsb- - when i did they were all great about it - but it was in an era when it was a difficult thing to be .
" it got me down so much that i just could not cope anymore .
i thought there was only one way out of this and that 's foolishly what i tried to do .
" i got up early in the morning - left the house - left a note for my parents - and i walked and walked for ages .
i landed up trying to take an overdose . "
' embarrassed and ashamed ' after his parents found the note they contacted the police and he was found in the nick of time .
" i was airlifted to hospital , spent four or five days there , and then coming out i was embarrassed about what i had done and ashamed .
" when i saw my parents crying from what i had done it made me so ashamed to put them through that .
when you are in that frame of mind there is nothing you can do - i think the only way out of it is to tell people , talk to people and friends and family can help you out of it .
" i think it was a turning point - it made me realise it 's time you grew up , accepted who you were and got on with your life and make the most of it . "
but he said it took him several more years before he was ready to tell his parents and friends .
" actually saying those three little words " i am gay " was the most difficult thing i have ever had to do .
" i would rather referee in front of a passionate 80,000 crowd and give a last minute penalty than do that again .
i told my mum - we both shed a tear but nothing changed .
the book was launched in pontyberem on thursday night " they are obviously going to be disappointed - not disappointed in me as a person but disappointed that i was an only child and the realisation that maybe there would be no grandchildren .
" obviously it was difficult for them . "
the day after , he went to see his boss as a referee .
" if it was going to be an issue or a problem in my work as a referee i would have to make a decision - i would finish refereeing or live a lie .
" it was frightening because it was my career - i did not do anything else - it could have been the end of my career .
" he was very supportive - and the welsh rugby union as well - they have been very , very supportive .
i 've been lucky to have great employers from that point of view . "
then he sent text messages to all his friends .
" most all phoned back or sent a text , bar one , who is still friends with me but has not mentioned anything since and that 's fine . "
he said the response from many was that they had already guessed .
" i did that on a saturday night .
huw watkins , one of my colleagues as a referee , had an e-mail from a referee in new zealand on monday asking if it was true i was gay .
" it had gone from me texting someone in pontyberem on saturday night to the other side of the world within 24 hours . "
good banter he said he was also daunted by how supporters and players would take it .
" you do get the odd few who shout the odd things from the crowd - but most of that is still in good banter .
" i have been lucky .
everybody from supporters to players to coaches to administrators have all been very supportive .
" there are obviously people who may feel uncomfortable with it but they are very few and far between and you 've got to respect the way they think about people as well . "
he admits he was surprised how the rugby world did react .
" i think it shows that , especially in wales , how close a community rugby is .
this is not against football in any way because i like watching football .
" but i think when you think of spectators in football - if i was a football referee it would be more difficult to go and referee in football matches than it is in rugby matches . "

he told the jamie and louise programme : " i felt maybe if it helps someone along the way i would not like people to go through what i went through all those years ago . "
old fashioned mr owens said he was in his late teens or early twenties before he knew for certain he was gay .
" i was brought in a small community pretty much in an old fashioned way .
i was not really up to speed about what was going on in the modern world - coming from that sort of community .
" the long and short of it is i did not want to be gay .
i did not know what these feelings were at first - then realised what they were and thought ' i do not want to be like this . '
" it was in a time - 10 or 15 years ago - when it was n't as easy to be a gay person then as it is now .
not that it 's easy now , but it is more acceptable . "
as well as anecdotes from his upbringing and refereeing career mr owens talks about how being gay drove him to take an overdose and how if a police helicopter had not found him he would not be here today .
everybody from supporters to players to coaches to administrators have all been very supportive nigel owens , pictured refereeing england v new zealand " i was a person that i did not want to be - that 's what got me down .
i wanted a normal way of life , to get married and have children and stuff like that .
" looking back now i could have -lsb- told parents and friends -rsb- - when i did they were all great about it - but it was in an era when it was a difficult thing to be .
" it got me down so much that i just could not cope anymore .
i thought there was only one way out of this and that 's foolishly what i tried to do .
" i got up early in the morning - left the house - left a note for my parents - and i walked and walked for ages .
i landed up trying to take an overdose . "
' embarrassed and ashamed ' after his parents found the note they contacted the police and he was found in the nick of time .
" i was airlifted to hospital , spent four or five days there , and then coming out i was embarrassed about what i had done and ashamed .
" when i saw my parents crying from what i had done it made me so ashamed to put them through that .
when you are in that frame of mind there is nothing you can do - i think the only way out of it is to tell people , talk to people and friends and family can help you out of it .
" i think it was a turning point - it made me realise it 's time you grew up , accepted who you were and got on with your life and make the most of it . "
but he said it took him several more years before he was ready to tell his parents and friends .
" actually saying those three little words " i am gay " was the most difficult thing i have ever had to do .
" i would rather referee in front of a passionate 80,000 crowd and give a last minute penalty than do that again .
i told my mum - we both shed a tear but nothing changed .
the book was launched in pontyberem on thursday night " they are obviously going to be disappointed - not disappointed in me as a person but disappointed that i was an only child and the realisation that maybe there would be no grandchildren .
" obviously it was difficult for them . "
the day after , he went to see his boss as a referee .
" if it was going to be an issue or a problem in my work as a referee i would have to make a decision - i would finish refereeing or live a lie .
" it was frightening because it was my career - i did not do anything else - it could have been the end of my career .
" he was very supportive - and the welsh rugby union as well - they have been very , very supportive .
i 've been lucky to have great employers from that point of view . "
then he sent text messages to all his friends .
" most all phoned back or sent a text , bar one , who is still friends with me but has not mentioned anything since and that 's fine . "
he said the response from many was that they had already guessed .
" i did that on a saturday night .
huw watkins , one of my colleagues as a referee , had an e-mail from a referee in new zealand on monday asking if it was true i was gay .
" it had gone from me texting someone in pontyberem on saturday night to the other side of the world within 24 hours . "
good banter he said he was also daunted by how supporters and players would take it .
" you do get the odd few who shout the odd things from the crowd - but most of that is still in good banter .
" i have been lucky .
everybody from supporters to players to coaches to administrators have all been very supportive .
" there are obviously people who may feel uncomfortable with it but they are very few and far between and you 've got to respect the way they think about people as well . "
he admits he was surprised how the rugby world did react .
" i think it shows that , especially in wales , how close a community rugby is .
this is not against football in any way because i like watching football .
" but i think when you think of spectators in football - if i was a football referee it would be more difficult to go and referee in football matches than it is in rugby matches . "
