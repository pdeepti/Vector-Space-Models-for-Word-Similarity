opposition leaders claimed the poll was fraudulent and promised to stage demonstrations . saakashvili 's united nation movement received 63 percent of the popular vote in national elections . the president 's closest rival , the united opposition group , would receive approximately 15 percent of ballots cast , according to exit polls . the poll numbers - if confirmed by official counts expected on thursday - would allow the unm and saakashvili to dominate the country 's politics and make decisions at will , to include changing the constitution . two other small political players appeared on track to place mps in parliament - a party led by television announcer georgy targamadze with 9 percent , and the labor party with slightly more than 5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher than in january 's elections , the cec said if preliminary polls prove accurate , saakashvili 's party would win more than half of the 150 seats in parliament . " the exit poll is the first sign that these elections were rigged , " said united opposition council leader levan gachechiladze , runner-up against saakashvili in a presidential vote in january . georgians voted for a new parliament against a background of accusations of vote fraud allegedly committed by saakashvili and his allies , and a firefight in a border region disputed between tbilisi and the kremlin . the vote was the first legislative referendum faced by the saakashvili-led party since winning a majority in georgia 's first-ever open parliamentary contest after the pro-democracy rose revolution five years ago . observers present georgians cast their ballots four months after saakashvili , 40 , won by 54 percent in snap elections called in the wake of violence between police and opposition protesters blaming the government for corruption , unemployment and curbing freedoms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili said holding a calm election was an important test for georgia more than 4,500 observers were monitoring the elections wednesday .
the poll was widely seen as a litmus test for the us-educated saakashvili 's credentials with the west as the georgian leader is pushing to join the north atlantic treaty organization and curry support in longstanding disputes with moscow . " i want everybody to understand ... the international community is watching these elections closely , " saakashvili told journalists after casting his ballot in the capital tbilisi on wednesday . saakashvili 's reputation as a west-leaning democrat was tarnished when he ordered troops to crush protests last november . difficult situation for georgia " georgia remains in a very difficult international situation now , " he said in apparent reference to difficulties with neighboring russia , news agency interfax reported .
" under such pressure and blackmail , holding an organized and calm election will be equivalent to georgia 's democracy passing an important test . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters had already taken to the streets before the election took place just a few hours into voting the nine-party opposition coalition alleged " grave violations " at over 12 polling stations and promised over 100,000 protesters would take to the streets . opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned the government , " if they do n't want a rebellion of the people and civil war , they must stop the mass falsifications at the regional polls . " he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .
they georgia government claimed the attackers used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to take a pair of buses carrying voters . tensions with moscow saakashvili has said the situation was close to war two weeks ago , and russia has increased its peacekeeping troops in the autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to the maximum under a 1994 ceasefire that ended civil war . the interior ministry in tbilisi said several people were injured in at least two explosions on buses .
a media consultant employed by the saakashvili administration claimed the blasts were part of an abkhazian attempt to undermine the elections . the mountainous former soviet republic of georgia has been at the heart of a regional struggle for influence between the united states and neighboring russia since it gained its independence in 1991 .
stretching south-east from the black sea , georgia straddles a key pipeline for caspian gas to europe . analysts fear that georgia 's opposition could well act out its threats of post-election demonstrations against rigged voting leading to prolonged unrest . " i would n't rule out the possibility of escalation in the aftermath because the votes of those dissatisfied will be barely counted .
so , they will take to the streets again , " an analyst with the moscow carnegie , alexei malashenko , wrote in business daily kommersant wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.05.2008 british nod to embryo ' chimeras ' raises hackles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently loosened its own stem-cell regulations britain 's decision to legalize hybrid animal-human embryos for medical research was widely met with negative reactions in germany and elsewhere in europe . on monday , may 19 , british lawmakers voted to legalize the creation of animal-human embryos for medical research .
critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .
stem-cell research has not led to a slew of expected breakthroughs , he pointed out .
research done adult stem cells , which are ethically unobjectionable , has accounted for more success , he said . big ' no ' from the catholic church the catholic church also voiced loud opposition to the british lawmakers ' move . german catholic theologian johannes reiter told radio vatican that the creation of chimeras was a breach of human dignity . berlin stem-cell researcher james adjaye told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung that when it comes to chimeras , it is too hard to answer the question : " what part of -lrb- the cell culture -rrb- is then from the embryo , and what part from the animal ? " " savior siblings " also approved but adjaye did stand behind one decision the british lawmakers made : legalizing " savior siblings , " children created as a genetic match for a sick brother or sister so that their genetic material can be used to treat them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell " it is like an organ donation from within the family , " adjaye said . for his part , the german medical association 's montgomery took issue with the " savior sibling " decision as well . " we consider it unethical to use a person for spare parts , " he told news organizations . on tuesday in brussels , eu parliamentarian peter liese , who heads a working group on bioethics , said the british move on chimeras was " scientifically irrational and irresponsible . " but juergen hescheler , the head of the german stem cell research association , approved of the decision , telling spiegel online , " we must follow every road in the name of research freedom .

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.05.2008 british nod to embryo ' chimeras ' raises hackles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently loosened its own stem-cell regulations britain 's decision to legalize hybrid animal-human embryos for medical research was widely met with negative reactions in germany and elsewhere in europe . on monday , may 19 , british lawmakers voted to legalize the creation of animal-human embryos for medical research .
critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .
stem-cell research has not led to a slew of expected breakthroughs , he pointed out .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .

developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.05.2008 british nod to embryo ' chimeras ' raises hackles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently loosened its own stem-cell regulations britain 's decision to legalize hybrid animal-human embryos for medical research was widely met with negative reactions in germany and elsewhere in europe . on monday , may 19 , british lawmakers voted to legalize the creation of animal-human embryos for medical research .
critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .
stem-cell research has not led to a slew of expected breakthroughs , he pointed out .
research done adult stem cells , which are ethically unobjectionable , has accounted for more success , he said . big ' no ' from the catholic church the catholic church also voiced loud opposition to the british lawmakers ' move . german catholic theologian johannes reiter told radio vatican that the creation of chimeras was a breach of human dignity . berlin stem-cell researcher james adjaye told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung that when it comes to chimeras , it is too hard to answer the question : " what part of -lrb- the cell culture -rrb- is then from the embryo , and what part from the animal ? " " savior siblings " also approved but adjaye did stand behind one decision the british lawmakers made : legalizing " savior siblings , " children created as a genetic match for a sick brother or sister so that their genetic material can be used to treat them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell " it is like an organ donation from within the family , " adjaye said . for his part , the german medical association 's montgomery took issue with the " savior sibling " decision as well . " we consider it unethical to use a person for spare parts , " he told news organizations . on tuesday in brussels , eu parliamentarian peter liese , who heads a working group on bioethics , said the british move on chimeras was " scientifically irrational and irresponsible . " but juergen hescheler , the head of the german stem cell research association , approved of the decision , telling spiegel online , " we must follow every road in the name of research freedom .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .

the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision .

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious .

can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

it 's been overly optimistic , say experts . a lofty goal - to slash co2 emissions by 40 percent from levels recorded in 1990 - was announced last summer ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm . but a new study commissioned by the german green party suggests these goals - part of an " integrated energy and climate program " may be more ambitious than the measures aimed at reducing the greenhouse gases .
the study , conducted by the environmental institute ecofys , suggests that with the changes already in place , the country will only be able to reduce emissions by 28 percent over the next decade . ueber-optimism from berlin according to the report , an 18 percent decrease in emissions should already have been noted .
but with the " meseberg package , " a series of laws considered the core of german climate change policy , the report 's authors see a savings of just 10 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study advocates a greater use of biofuels the newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung reported wednesday that the study 's authors , a group of climate and environment experts , attribute the shortfall to optimistic assumptions and the subsequent pejoration of legal regulations . energy plans lacking , say experts they find it " urgently necessary to develop more effective measures " to reduce the output of the greenhouse gases .
among the areas that the study 's authors believe the government needs to pay specific attention to is energy . they believe the plans for developing more efficient power plants have " not been ambitious enough . "
likewise , energy usage needs to be cut dramatically . the report also recommends that the share of biofuels be increased and the regulations sanctioning the renovation of buildings loosened in order to increase the country 's chances of meeting their 2020 goal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .

opposition leaders claimed the poll was fraudulent and promised to stage demonstrations . saakashvili 's united nation movement received 63 percent of the popular vote in national elections . the president 's closest rival , the united opposition group , would receive approximately 15 percent of ballots cast , according to exit polls . the poll numbers - if confirmed by official counts expected on thursday - would allow the unm and saakashvili to dominate the country 's politics and make decisions at will , to include changing the constitution . two other small political players appeared on track to place mps in parliament - a party led by television announcer georgy targamadze with 9 percent , and the labor party with slightly more than 5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher than in january 's elections , the cec said if preliminary polls prove accurate , saakashvili 's party would win more than half of the 150 seats in parliament . " the exit poll is the first sign that these elections were rigged , " said united opposition council leader levan gachechiladze , runner-up against saakashvili in a presidential vote in january . georgians voted for a new parliament against a background of accusations of vote fraud allegedly committed by saakashvili and his allies , and a firefight in a border region disputed between tbilisi and the kremlin . the vote was the first legislative referendum faced by the saakashvili-led party since winning a majority in georgia 's first-ever open parliamentary contest after the pro-democracy rose revolution five years ago . observers present georgians cast their ballots four months after saakashvili , 40 , won by 54 percent in snap elections called in the wake of violence between police and opposition protesters blaming the government for corruption , unemployment and curbing freedoms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili said holding a calm election was an important test for georgia more than 4,500 observers were monitoring the elections wednesday .
the poll was widely seen as a litmus test for the us-educated saakashvili 's credentials with the west as the georgian leader is pushing to join the north atlantic treaty organization and curry support in longstanding disputes with moscow . " i want everybody to understand ... the international community is watching these elections closely , " saakashvili told journalists after casting his ballot in the capital tbilisi on wednesday . saakashvili 's reputation as a west-leaning democrat was tarnished when he ordered troops to crush protests last november . difficult situation for georgia " georgia remains in a very difficult international situation now , " he said in apparent reference to difficulties with neighboring russia , news agency interfax reported .
" under such pressure and blackmail , holding an organized and calm election will be equivalent to georgia 's democracy passing an important test . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters had already taken to the streets before the election took place just a few hours into voting the nine-party opposition coalition alleged " grave violations " at over 12 polling stations and promised over 100,000 protesters would take to the streets . opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned the government , " if they do n't want a rebellion of the people and civil war , they must stop the mass falsifications at the regional polls . " he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .
they georgia government claimed the attackers used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to take a pair of buses carrying voters . tensions with moscow saakashvili has said the situation was close to war two weeks ago , and russia has increased its peacekeeping troops in the autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to the maximum under a 1994 ceasefire that ended civil war . the interior ministry in tbilisi said several people were injured in at least two explosions on buses .
a media consultant employed by the saakashvili administration claimed the blasts were part of an abkhazian attempt to undermine the elections . the mountainous former soviet republic of georgia has been at the heart of a regional struggle for influence between the united states and neighboring russia since it gained its independence in 1991 .
stretching south-east from the black sea , georgia straddles a key pipeline for caspian gas to europe . analysts fear that georgia 's opposition could well act out its threats of post-election demonstrations against rigged voting leading to prolonged unrest . " i would n't rule out the possibility of escalation in the aftermath because the votes of those dissatisfied will be barely counted .

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .

brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .

" the exit poll is the first sign that these elections were rigged , " said united opposition council leader levan gachechiladze , runner-up against saakashvili in a presidential vote in january . georgians voted for a new parliament against a background of accusations of vote fraud allegedly committed by saakashvili and his allies , and a firefight in a border region disputed between tbilisi and the kremlin . the vote was the first legislative referendum faced by the saakashvili-led party since winning a majority in georgia 's first-ever open parliamentary contest after the pro-democracy rose revolution five years ago . observers present georgians cast their ballots four months after saakashvili , 40 , won by 54 percent in snap elections called in the wake of violence between police and opposition protesters blaming the government for corruption , unemployment and curbing freedoms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili said holding a calm election was an important test for georgia more than 4,500 observers were monitoring the elections wednesday .

" i want everybody to understand ... the international community is watching these elections closely , " saakashvili told journalists after casting his ballot in the capital tbilisi on wednesday . saakashvili 's reputation as a west-leaning democrat was tarnished when he ordered troops to crush protests last november . difficult situation for georgia " georgia remains in a very difficult international situation now , " he said in apparent reference to difficulties with neighboring russia , news agency interfax reported .

" he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .
they georgia government claimed the attackers used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to take a pair of buses carrying voters . tensions with moscow saakashvili has said the situation was close to war two weeks ago , and russia has increased its peacekeeping troops in the autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to the maximum under a 1994 ceasefire that ended civil war . the interior ministry in tbilisi said several people were injured in at least two explosions on buses .
a media consultant employed by the saakashvili administration claimed the blasts were part of an abkhazian attempt to undermine the elections . the mountainous former soviet republic of georgia has been at the heart of a regional struggle for influence between the united states and neighboring russia since it gained its independence in 1991 .
stretching south-east from the black sea , georgia straddles a key pipeline for caspian gas to europe . analysts fear that georgia 's opposition could well act out its threats of post-election demonstrations against rigged voting leading to prolonged unrest .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .

the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

it 's been overly optimistic , say experts . a lofty goal - to slash co2 emissions by 40 percent from levels recorded in 1990 - was announced last summer ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm . but a new study commissioned by the german green party suggests these goals - part of an " integrated energy and climate program " may be more ambitious than the measures aimed at reducing the greenhouse gases .
the study , conducted by the environmental institute ecofys , suggests that with the changes already in place , the country will only be able to reduce emissions by 28 percent over the next decade . ueber-optimism from berlin according to the report , an 18 percent decrease in emissions should already have been noted .
but with the " meseberg package , " a series of laws considered the core of german climate change policy , the report 's authors see a savings of just 10 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study advocates a greater use of biofuels the newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung reported wednesday that the study 's authors , a group of climate and environment experts , attribute the shortfall to optimistic assumptions and the subsequent pejoration of legal regulations . energy plans lacking , say experts they find it " urgently necessary to develop more effective measures " to reduce the output of the greenhouse gases .
among the areas that the study 's authors believe the government needs to pay specific attention to is energy . they believe the plans for developing more efficient power plants have " not been ambitious enough . "
likewise , energy usage needs to be cut dramatically . the report also recommends that the share of biofuels be increased and the regulations sanctioning the renovation of buildings loosened in order to increase the country 's chances of meeting their 2020 goal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.05.2008 british parliament rejects changes in abortion law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british mps voted against changing the country 's liberal abortion laws attempts by opposition conservatives to tighten britain 's liberal abortion laws were defeated late tuesday , may 20 , when parliament voted to leave the upper time limit for pregnancy termination at 24 weeks . a number of conservative motions , ranging from lowering the legal limit to between 12 and 22 weeks , were rejected .
in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away .
-lrb- 14.01.2008 -rrb- common abortion policy remains out of reach in eu an eu citizen denied an abortion in her own country can freely travel to a member state where it is legal .
but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.05.2008 british nod to embryo ' chimeras ' raises hackles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently loosened its own stem-cell regulations britain 's decision to legalize hybrid animal-human embryos for medical research was widely met with negative reactions in germany and elsewhere in europe . on monday , may 19 , british lawmakers voted to legalize the creation of animal-human embryos for medical research .
critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .
stem-cell research has not led to a slew of expected breakthroughs , he pointed out .
research done adult stem cells , which are ethically unobjectionable , has accounted for more success , he said . big ' no ' from the catholic church the catholic church also voiced loud opposition to the british lawmakers ' move . german catholic theologian johannes reiter told radio vatican that the creation of chimeras was a breach of human dignity . berlin stem-cell researcher james adjaye told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung that when it comes to chimeras , it is too hard to answer the question : " what part of -lrb- the cell culture -rrb- is then from the embryo , and what part from the animal ?

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .

number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .
the country 's foreign ministry issued a statement saying that while the proposals were a step in the right direction , they " remain vague on the central questions like subsidy ceilings and tariff barriers in the more advanced economies .

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.05.2008 british parliament rejects changes in abortion law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british mps voted against changing the country 's liberal abortion laws attempts by opposition conservatives to tighten britain 's liberal abortion laws were defeated late tuesday , may 20 , when parliament voted to leave the upper time limit for pregnancy termination at 24 weeks . a number of conservative motions , ranging from lowering the legal limit to between 12 and 22 weeks , were rejected .
in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .

germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .

" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .

brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .
the country 's foreign ministry issued a statement saying that while the proposals were a step in the right direction , they " remain vague on the central questions like subsidy ceilings and tariff barriers in the more advanced economies .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .
the country 's foreign ministry issued a statement saying that while the proposals were a step in the right direction , they " remain vague on the central questions like subsidy ceilings and tariff barriers in the more advanced economies .

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the exit poll is the first sign that these elections were rigged , " said united opposition council leader levan gachechiladze , runner-up against saakashvili in a presidential vote in january . georgians voted for a new parliament against a background of accusations of vote fraud allegedly committed by saakashvili and his allies , and a firefight in a border region disputed between tbilisi and the kremlin . the vote was the first legislative referendum faced by the saakashvili-led party since winning a majority in georgia 's first-ever open parliamentary contest after the pro-democracy rose revolution five years ago . observers present georgians cast their ballots four months after saakashvili , 40 , won by 54 percent in snap elections called in the wake of violence between police and opposition protesters blaming the government for corruption , unemployment and curbing freedoms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili said holding a calm election was an important test for georgia more than 4,500 observers were monitoring the elections wednesday .
the poll was widely seen as a litmus test for the us-educated saakashvili 's credentials with the west as the georgian leader is pushing to join the north atlantic treaty organization and curry support in longstanding disputes with moscow . " i want everybody to understand ... the international community is watching these elections closely , " saakashvili told journalists after casting his ballot in the capital tbilisi on wednesday . saakashvili 's reputation as a west-leaning democrat was tarnished when he ordered troops to crush protests last november . difficult situation for georgia " georgia remains in a very difficult international situation now , " he said in apparent reference to difficulties with neighboring russia , news agency interfax reported .
" under such pressure and blackmail , holding an organized and calm election will be equivalent to georgia 's democracy passing an important test . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters had already taken to the streets before the election took place just a few hours into voting the nine-party opposition coalition alleged " grave violations " at over 12 polling stations and promised over 100,000 protesters would take to the streets . opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned the government , " if they do n't want a rebellion of the people and civil war , they must stop the mass falsifications at the regional polls . " he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .
they georgia government claimed the attackers used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to take a pair of buses carrying voters . tensions with moscow saakashvili has said the situation was close to war two weeks ago , and russia has increased its peacekeeping troops in the autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to the maximum under a 1994 ceasefire that ended civil war . the interior ministry in tbilisi said several people were injured in at least two explosions on buses .
a media consultant employed by the saakashvili administration claimed the blasts were part of an abkhazian attempt to undermine the elections . the mountainous former soviet republic of georgia has been at the heart of a regional struggle for influence between the united states and neighboring russia since it gained its independence in 1991 .
stretching south-east from the black sea , georgia straddles a key pipeline for caspian gas to europe . analysts fear that georgia 's opposition could well act out its threats of post-election demonstrations against rigged voting leading to prolonged unrest . " i would n't rule out the possibility of escalation in the aftermath because the votes of those dissatisfied will be barely counted .

opposition leaders claimed the poll was fraudulent and promised to stage demonstrations . saakashvili 's united nation movement received 63 percent of the popular vote in national elections . the president 's closest rival , the united opposition group , would receive approximately 15 percent of ballots cast , according to exit polls . the poll numbers - if confirmed by official counts expected on thursday - would allow the unm and saakashvili to dominate the country 's politics and make decisions at will , to include changing the constitution . two other small political players appeared on track to place mps in parliament - a party led by television announcer georgy targamadze with 9 percent , and the labor party with slightly more than 5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher than in january 's elections , the cec said if preliminary polls prove accurate , saakashvili 's party would win more than half of the 150 seats in parliament . " the exit poll is the first sign that these elections were rigged , " said united opposition council leader levan gachechiladze , runner-up against saakashvili in a presidential vote in january . georgians voted for a new parliament against a background of accusations of vote fraud allegedly committed by saakashvili and his allies , and a firefight in a border region disputed between tbilisi and the kremlin . the vote was the first legislative referendum faced by the saakashvili-led party since winning a majority in georgia 's first-ever open parliamentary contest after the pro-democracy rose revolution five years ago . observers present georgians cast their ballots four months after saakashvili , 40 , won by 54 percent in snap elections called in the wake of violence between police and opposition protesters blaming the government for corruption , unemployment and curbing freedoms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili said holding a calm election was an important test for georgia more than 4,500 observers were monitoring the elections wednesday .
the poll was widely seen as a litmus test for the us-educated saakashvili 's credentials with the west as the georgian leader is pushing to join the north atlantic treaty organization and curry support in longstanding disputes with moscow . " i want everybody to understand ... the international community is watching these elections closely , " saakashvili told journalists after casting his ballot in the capital tbilisi on wednesday . saakashvili 's reputation as a west-leaning democrat was tarnished when he ordered troops to crush protests last november . difficult situation for georgia " georgia remains in a very difficult international situation now , " he said in apparent reference to difficulties with neighboring russia , news agency interfax reported .
" under such pressure and blackmail , holding an organized and calm election will be equivalent to georgia 's democracy passing an important test . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters had already taken to the streets before the election took place just a few hours into voting the nine-party opposition coalition alleged " grave violations " at over 12 polling stations and promised over 100,000 protesters would take to the streets . opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned the government , " if they do n't want a rebellion of the people and civil war , they must stop the mass falsifications at the regional polls . " he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .

italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .
but discussions became mired in disputes between rich and poor countries on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs .
developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .
" germany will continue to push for the wto to stronger regulate or abolish export restrictions , " he said .
brazil dissatisfied with new proposals european countries are pushing for a trade deal before presidential elections in the united states in november signal a change in the us officials involved in the negotiations .
but if brazil 's reaction to the new proposals on farm subsidies and import tariffs is anything to go by , the talks might drag on for some time to come .
brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .
the country 's foreign ministry issued a statement saying that while the proposals were a step in the right direction , they " remain vague on the central questions like subsidy ceilings and tariff barriers in the more advanced economies .

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .

" the federal government would support the completion of the negotiations this year , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the economics ministry .
he welcomed the wto 's revised negotiating texts , saying he hoped they would help germany achieve its goal of improved market access for industrial goods and services .
wto head pascal lamy said the new draft texts would act as a catalyst for crucial action .
" we are getting closer to our end game , " lamy said .
" these revised negotiating texts illustrate clearly where convergence lies among the wto members and where we have more work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto hopes the new texts will revive the stalled trade talks negotiations for the liberalization of global trade got underway in the qatari capital , doha , at the end of 2001 with the goal of reaching a deal by 2004 .

developing nations have been seeking greater access for their agricultural goods on markets in the developed world .
rich nations have , in turn , been pressing for a better deal in emerging economies for their industrial products and services .
germany stresses need for compromise in germany , the world 's biggest exporter , the bdi business lobby said the new proposals made it difficult to achieve an ambitious conclusion to doha .
" the european commission and eu member states must push for the reduction of industrial tariffs in emerging nations , " said bdi spokesman carsten kreklau .
" a one-sided reduction by industrialized nations is completely unacceptable . "
but economics ministry state secretary pfaffenbach emphasized that all 150 wto members had to be prepared to compromise if the talks were to come to a balanced conclusion .
he said this especially applied to big emerging economies like brazil and india , adding that developing nations could not be expected to make the same allowances as further developed industrial nations .
pfaffenbach also said that a swift conclusion to the doha talks would help improve the supply of foodstuffs in the world 's poorest countries .

brazil , which heads the g20 , a group of developing nations pitted against the us and the eu in the talks , said the new offers on the table were too short on detail .

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .

it allows clients to upload a digital photograph of a loved one or a commercial product .
a week later they receive printed , post-paid envelopes showing the same picture . successful attempt neo-nazis apparently exploited the opportunity by uploading a picture of hess , who was nazi dictator adolf hitler 's deputy .
hess committed suicide in berlin while serving a life sentence for war crimes in spandau prison .
he is a hero to neo-nazis , who often demonstrate on the anniversary of his death in august . the post staff did not notice they had been tricked into issuing the 55-cent stamps . " it was a slip-up .
we are very sorry about it , " said post spokesman dirk klasen at the company 's offices in bonn . " it runs in most cases without difficulty , " klasen said .
" only with the hess image did something go awry .
i presume it came from the far-right scene .
but those 20 envelopes wo n't shake up german democracy . " earlier this year , the company intercepted a request to have stamps printed featuring hitler as a small child , he said . procedure review is planned the latest newsletter of the far-right national democratic party gloated about being able to slip the stamp past deutsche post 's quality control personnel . " the hess stamp is out there , " wrote hannes natter in the may edition of deutsche stimme , or german voice . deutsche post is now going to review its oversight procedures , klasen said , though he added that " there can be no 100 percent certainty " that something else would not slip through . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters had already taken to the streets before the election took place just a few hours into voting the nine-party opposition coalition alleged " grave violations " at over 12 polling stations and promised over 100,000 protesters would take to the streets . opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned the government , " if they do n't want a rebellion of the people and civil war , they must stop the mass falsifications at the regional polls . " he also claimed victory in the election and accused saakashvili of rigging the polls . " i would like to congratulate georgian society on the fact that the opposition has won in all of georgia , " gamkrelidze told reporters .
" the authorities have totally lost . " another opposition bloc leader , levan gachechiladze , said demonstrations protesting the vote 's outcome would be held wednesday . unrest on election day a dpa news agency reporter observed a substantial and sometimes unconcealed police presence near polling stations and in public areas in the provincial city gori . georgian television carried images of election officials and opposition representatives in provincial villages fighting with fists as a result of an election procedure dispute . violence struck near the villages gali and zugdidi , on the border of georgia and its renegade province abkahzia , where local citizens were fired on by unknown assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increases in russian troops in abkazia are keeping ties between moscow and tbilisi tense georgian television carried images of soldiers returning fire with automatic rifles and machine guns .
one woman was shown with a gunshot wound to her back . abkhazian troops had fired upon ethnic georgians returning to georgian territory to vote , according to the news reports .
they georgia government claimed the attackers used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to take a pair of buses carrying voters . tensions with moscow saakashvili has said the situation was close to war two weeks ago , and russia has increased its peacekeeping troops in the autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to the maximum under a 1994 ceasefire that ended civil war . the interior ministry in tbilisi said several people were injured in at least two explosions on buses .
a media consultant employed by the saakashvili administration claimed the blasts were part of an abkhazian attempt to undermine the elections . the mountainous former soviet republic of georgia has been at the heart of a regional struggle for influence between the united states and neighboring russia since it gained its independence in 1991 .
stretching south-east from the black sea , georgia straddles a key pipeline for caspian gas to europe . analysts fear that georgia 's opposition could well act out its threats of post-election demonstrations against rigged voting leading to prolonged unrest . " i would n't rule out the possibility of escalation in the aftermath because the votes of those dissatisfied will be barely counted .
so , they will take to the streets again , " an analyst with the moscow carnegie , alexei malashenko , wrote in business daily kommersant wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 'll try to help his alpine home country , hardly a football powerhouse , to a respectable showing at the european championship .
dw-world.de : as co-host , is switzerland ready for the tournament ?
tranquillo barnetta : i think so .
it will take a little while for everyone to get excited .
but i 'm sure it will be a great party .
and what 's the swiss national team doing ?
we still have a couple of friendlies .
but we 're on the right track , and i 'm convinced that we 'll do well at euro 2008 .
you 're not only a regular in the team .
you 're also one of switzerland 's biggest hopes for the future .
how do you deal with that responsibility ?
the responsibility does n't fall on my shoulders alone .
we have to try as a team to play a good tournament .
along the way , i 'll be trying to do my best and help the team , and i 'm certain we 'll be successful .
you 're still a young player .
how much will the experience of playing in a european championship help you become a leader on the pitch ?
i 'm going to try to take all the positives with me that i can and to develop as a player .
we 'll see how my career goes then .
you 've played most of your career in the german bundesliga ?
can that experience help the swiss national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta has played for both hanover and leverkusen in the bundesliga yes , a lot .
but playing internationally is different from playing in the bundesliga .
the level is higher .
so i 'm very glad to be playing for switzerland .
swiss players are also very prominent in the bundesliga .
there are five or six that play for the top clubs in the league and are fixtures for the swiss national team .
that 's a very nice thing .
we 're really happy to have people playing in such a good league .
it 's very positive for us .
switzerland play turkey in the first round of euro 2008 .
when the two teams last met in the world cup qualifiers , there were riots .
is all that forgotten ?
yes , it was a while ago , and i do n't think there will be a repeat in switzerland .
it was a one-off occurrence .
after the match -lsb- against turkey -rsb- , everything will be forgotten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland had to flee fan violence when they played turkey in the world cup qualifiers how do you size up turkey as an opponent ?
i think it 's a very balanced team .
but of course , if we want to advance we 'll have to beat turkey .
portugal , another one of switzerland 's first-round opponents , have a very strong team .
definitely .
they 're probably the best in the group , together with the czech republic .
when you look at how they play , you see they have some global stars in their squad .
we 're going to have to put the pedal to the metal to keep up with them .
your coach , kobi kuhn , has said the team wants to make the semifinals at least .
is that a realistic goal ?
or is he just trying to get people fired up ?
no , it 's realistic .
we know it will be hard .
our group is very balanced , but anyone can beat anyone .
so i 'm hoping will be one of the top two teams in the group , and then we 'll see how far we can go .
who do you think will be european champion ?
we 'll see .
in my book , italy , germany and france are the favorites .
and switzerland will come in fourth ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnetta also played in the 2006 world cup wait and see .
we hope that we 'll be good for a surprise .
fourth would be a very good result .
that would be a remarkable development for switzerland ahead of former bayern munich coach otmar hitzfeld taking over the team .
exactly , but for now , we 're working with kobi kuhn .
first we 'll concentrate on the euro .
afterward , i think , we have a great coach in otmar hitzfeld .
being the host puts additional pressure on the team because you 're playing in your own stadiums in front of your home fans .
do you agree ?
of course .
but we have to try to see it not in terms of pressure , but as a chance to get the crowd behind us and outperform ourselves .
i 'm convinced that it wo n't lead to paralysis , but that it will be something positive for us .
can visitors expect the same sort of atmosphere in switzerland as in germany during the 2006 world cup ?
i think so .
there probably wo n't be the same masses of people because everything in switzerland is a bit smaller .
but the euphoria will be same .
the same enthusiasm ?

critics said the move was unethical , but supporters cited the need to forge ahead in stem-cell research by any means necessary . after a very heated debate , britain 's lower house of parliament voted on the human embryology and fertilization bill , which could well be the biggest shake-up of laws affecting sensitive areas like stem cell research and abortion in the past two decades . in the future , scientists in britain will be allowed to combine human dna with animal egg cells .
but the law says the resulting " chimera " embryos must destroyed within 14 days , and can not be implanted . schavan criticizes " highly dubious " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyle armstrong led the team of researchers who created the chimeras the amendment that would have outlawed the creation of hybrid embryos was defeated by 336 to 176 votes .
the proponents of the chimera law said it would help ensure a more plentiful supply of stem cells for use in research into treating conditions like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , because it does n't require female human embryos . annette schavan , germany 's minister of education and research , sharply criticized the uk decision , calling it " wrong and highly ethically dubious . "
a boundary has been crossed , she said wednesday in berlin . the german medical association sharply criticized the move , and many researchers are skeptical about the utility of such chimeras .
schavan warned that the eu needed to be careful to see that no money was going to chimera-based research , and said organizations need to be carful and to make sure the rules are being followed . in germany , which has some of the strictest rules on stem-cell use in all of europe , " creating chimeras is against the law , and that will remain the case , " said a spokesman for the education and research ministry . doubts thrown on usefulness of chimera tests frank ulrich montgomery , the vice-president of the german medical association , spoke out immediately against the uk decision . " we consider this decision to be a serious mistake , " he told ap news service . " just the fact that viable embryos are to be destroyed shows that they are developing a completely different relationship to growing life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embrionic stem cells are kept in liquid nitrogen he added that the expectations that these experiments will lead to therapeutic results are deceptive .
stem-cell research has not led to a slew of expected breakthroughs , he pointed out .
research done adult stem cells , which are ethically unobjectionable , has accounted for more success , he said . big ' no ' from the catholic church the catholic church also voiced loud opposition to the british lawmakers ' move . german catholic theologian johannes reiter told radio vatican that the creation of chimeras was a breach of human dignity . berlin stem-cell researcher james adjaye told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung that when it comes to chimeras , it is too hard to answer the question : " what part of -lrb- the cell culture -rrb- is then from the embryo , and what part from the animal ? " " savior siblings " also approved but adjaye did stand behind one decision the british lawmakers made : legalizing " savior siblings , " children created as a genetic match for a sick brother or sister so that their genetic material can be used to treat them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell " it is like an organ donation from within the family , " adjaye said . for his part , the german medical association 's montgomery took issue with the " savior sibling " decision as well . " we consider it unethical to use a person for spare parts , " he told news organizations . on tuesday in brussels , eu parliamentarian peter liese , who heads a working group on bioethics , said the british move on chimeras was " scientifically irrational and irresponsible . " but juergen hescheler , the head of the german stem cell research association , approved of the decision , telling spiegel online , " we must follow every road in the name of research freedom .

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a series of votes , members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- defeated a reduction to 22 weeks by a vote of 304-232 .
the parliamentary debate on abortion was part of a current overhaul of britain 's human fertilization and embryology bill , which has already seen radical changes in laws governing embryo and stem-cell research .
a lowering of the gestation limit would have marked britain 's first major change in abortion law since 1990 , when the limit was cut from 28 to 24 weeks .
the 24-week limit is double that of france and germany , six weeks later than sweden and norway and the same as in the netherlands .
pro-life campaigners argued that medical advances have raised survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks gestation from 32 percent in 1981 to 71 percent in 2000 .
but other research has shown that there is no improvement in " viability rates " for babies born before 24 weeks .
number of abortions increasing in britain pro-choice campaigners point out that only 1.5 percent of the annual 200,000 abortions in britain are carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , the country 's biggest association of doctors , came out in favor of keeping the 24-week limit , as has labour prime minister gordon brown .
" the medical evidence has not changed , and that is why i will support the 24 weeks , " brown said ahead of the vote .
conservative mp nadine dorries , who initiated a motion to cut the time limit to 20 weeks , said action was needed to reduce the fast-rising number of abortions in britain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tribunal condemned this , saying the members of other parties did such work without any reward . several of the other german political parties have been calling for the npd to be shut down , charging that it is neo-nazi ; anti-democratic parties are barred from legal existence under the german constitution .
the npd refutes this allegation . audits to continue the npd general secretary , peter marx , accused the government of trying to bankrupt the party through audits . all of germany 's political parties have only modest fund-raising capacities and instead receive large sums from government funds to pay staff and fund campaigning .
they argue that neutral subsidies prevent them becoming beholden to rich donors . parliamentary counsel christian kirchberg said further audits of the npd 's regional chapters would follow . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has also said it would appoint special " roma commissioners " in some cities .
but on tuesday , may 20 , eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla said the commission would watch the situation in italy in light of the package of proposals .
he said romanians had the freedom to move within the eu and could not be treated differently from any other citizens from the 27-member bloc .
many ethnic roma come from romania , which joined the eu in 2007 .
crimes committed by foreigners , especially roma or gypsies , became a major political issue during italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's election campaign .
he promised to get tough on such crimes if elected .
italians target roma in violent incidents roma immigrants have been targeted in violent incidents recently by italian civilians attempting to take the law into their own hands .
last week , an illegal roma camp in naples was evacuated after locals set fire to the shacks , responding to reports that a roma girl had apparently tried to kidnap an italian baby .
the incident was the latest of a series of high profile cases involving italy 's roma community .
interior minister roberto maroni said the government intends to dismantle roma camps which are present in and around many of italy 's major cities .
italy 's new european affairs minister , andrea ronchi said " it is no longer possible to let illegal immigrants commit crimes unpunished . "
germany expresses concern but rome 's new anti-immigration drive prompted concern from other eu countries .
according to michael roth , a parliamentary spokesman on european policy for germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the berlusconi government " is already showing its lack of respect for basic european rights . "
" the pogrom-like attacks on roma and other minorities give grounds for great concern , " he said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what are the issues in the debate and how has the law changed over the years ?
where does the current law stand ?
a private member 's bill brought by david steel mp led to the abortion act 1967 , which is still the law governing abortions in england , scotland and wales .
technically the law did not legalise abortions , but rather provided a legal defence for those carrying them out .
abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions - the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination .
the woman 's " actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment " may be taken into account .
abortion up to 24 weeks is also allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child when born would suffer " such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped " .
an abortion must be agreed by two doctors -lrb- or one in an emergency -rrb- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic .
does the law apply in northern ireland ?
the act does not extend to northern ireland , where the law has been less clear .
many women travel to england or scotland for abortions .
a court of appeal ruling in october 2004 ordered the department of health to draw up guidelines on when abortions can be carried out under existing law , following a campaign by the family planning association .
currently , abortion is only permissible in northern ireland where the mother 's life is in danger or there is a serious threat to her mental or physical health .
has the 1967 law ever been updated ?
yes , via the human embryology and human fertilisation act 1990 , which was brought in primarily to control new infertility treatments and to monitor experiments on embryos .
a section of the act also lowered the legal time limit for abortions from 28 to 24 weeks , which is now the accepted point at which a foetus is " viable " .
the act also clarified under which special circumstances abortions could be carried out at a later stage .
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if there is grave risk to the life of the woman ; evidence of severe foetal abnormality ; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman .
what is happening now ?
mps were asked to vote on cutting the limit for the first time since 1990 .
the votes were on a series of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill .
there were calls for a reduction to 12 , 16 , 20 or 22 weeks .
what was the argument in favour of reducing the limit ?
those in favour of a change said babies born at 24 weeks were increasingly likely to survive , and it should therefore not be permitted to abort pregnancies at this stage .
right-to-life groups add that efforts should be made to save every life .
and what was the argument against ?
studies , including one published in the british medical journal this month , show that while survival rates have increased significantly for babies born at 24 and 25 weeks , they have not risen for babies born 23 weeks or less .
very few terminations take place at this stage of pregnancy , but those in favour of keeping the limit as it is say that it is often the 20 week scan which reveals severe abnormalities .
where do the three main political parties stand ?
the labour , conservative and liberal democrat parties all consider the issue to be one on which individual mps should have a free vote .
labour leader gordon brown says he backs sticking with the 24-week limit .
conservative leader david cameron favours a cut .

currently , abortion is only permissible in northern ireland where the mother 's life is in danger or there is a serious threat to her mental or physical health .
has the 1967 law ever been updated ?
yes , via the human embryology and human fertilisation act 1990 , which was brought in primarily to control new infertility treatments and to monitor experiments on embryos .
a section of the act also lowered the legal time limit for abortions from 28 to 24 weeks , which is now the accepted point at which a foetus is " viable " .
the act also clarified under which special circumstances abortions could be carried out at a later stage .
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if there is grave risk to the life of the woman ; evidence of severe foetal abnormality ; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman .
what is happening now ?
mps were asked to vote on cutting the limit for the first time since 1990 .
the votes were on a series of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill .
there were calls for a reduction to 12 , 16 , 20 or 22 weeks .
what was the argument in favour of reducing the limit ?
those in favour of a change said babies born at 24 weeks were increasingly likely to survive , and it should therefore not be permitted to abort pregnancies at this stage .
right-to-life groups add that efforts should be made to save every life .
and what was the argument against ?
studies , including one published in the british medical journal this month , show that while survival rates have increased significantly for babies born at 24 and 25 weeks , they have not risen for babies born 23 weeks or less .
very few terminations take place at this stage of pregnancy , but those in favour of keeping the limit as it is say that it is often the 20 week scan which reveals severe abnormalities .
where do the three main political parties stand ?
the labour , conservative and liberal democrat parties all consider the issue to be one on which individual mps should have a free vote .
labour leader gordon brown says he backs sticking with the 24-week limit .
conservative leader david cameron favours a cut .

but what are the issues in the debate and how has the law changed over the years ?
where does the current law stand ?
a private member 's bill brought by david steel mp led to the abortion act 1967 , which is still the law governing abortions in england , scotland and wales .
technically the law did not legalise abortions , but rather provided a legal defence for those carrying them out .
abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions - the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination .
the woman 's " actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment " may be taken into account .
abortion up to 24 weeks is also allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child when born would suffer " such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped " .
an abortion must be agreed by two doctors -lrb- or one in an emergency -rrb- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic .
does the law apply in northern ireland ?
the act does not extend to northern ireland , where the law has been less clear .

but what are the issues in the debate and how has the law changed over the years ?
where does the current law stand ?
a private member 's bill brought by david steel mp led to the abortion act 1967 , which is still the law governing abortions in england , scotland and wales .
technically the law did not legalise abortions , but rather provided a legal defence for those carrying them out .
abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions - the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination .
the woman 's " actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment " may be taken into account .
abortion up to 24 weeks is also allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child when born would suffer " such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped " .
an abortion must be agreed by two doctors -lrb- or one in an emergency -rrb- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic .
does the law apply in northern ireland ?
the act does not extend to northern ireland , where the law has been less clear .
many women travel to england or scotland for abortions .
a court of appeal ruling in october 2004 ordered the department of health to draw up guidelines on when abortions can be carried out under existing law , following a campaign by the family planning association .
currently , abortion is only permissible in northern ireland where the mother 's life is in danger or there is a serious threat to her mental or physical health .
has the 1967 law ever been updated ?
yes , via the human embryology and human fertilisation act 1990 , which was brought in primarily to control new infertility treatments and to monitor experiments on embryos .
a section of the act also lowered the legal time limit for abortions from 28 to 24 weeks , which is now the accepted point at which a foetus is " viable " .
the act also clarified under which special circumstances abortions could be carried out at a later stage .
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if there is grave risk to the life of the woman ; evidence of severe foetal abnormality ; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman .
what is happening now ?
mps were asked to vote on cutting the limit for the first time since 1990 .
the votes were on a series of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill .
there were calls for a reduction to 12 , 16 , 20 or 22 weeks .
what was the argument in favour of reducing the limit ?
those in favour of a change said babies born at 24 weeks were increasingly likely to survive , and it should therefore not be permitted to abort pregnancies at this stage .
right-to-life groups add that efforts should be made to save every life .
and what was the argument against ?
studies , including one published in the british medical journal this month , show that while survival rates have increased significantly for babies born at 24 and 25 weeks , they have not risen for babies born 23 weeks or less .
very few terminations take place at this stage of pregnancy , but those in favour of keeping the limit as it is say that it is often the 20 week scan which reveals severe abnormalities .
where do the three main political parties stand ?
the labour , conservative and liberal democrat parties all consider the issue to be one on which individual mps should have a free vote .
labour leader gordon brown says he backs sticking with the 24-week limit .
conservative leader david cameron favours a cut .

but what are the issues in the debate and how has the law changed over the years ?
where does the current law stand ?
a private member 's bill brought by david steel mp led to the abortion act 1967 , which is still the law governing abortions in england , scotland and wales .
technically the law did not legalise abortions , but rather provided a legal defence for those carrying them out .
abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions - the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination .
the woman 's " actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment " may be taken into account .
abortion up to 24 weeks is also allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child when born would suffer " such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped " .
an abortion must be agreed by two doctors -lrb- or one in an emergency -rrb- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic .
does the law apply in northern ireland ?
the act does not extend to northern ireland , where the law has been less clear .
many women travel to england or scotland for abortions .
a court of appeal ruling in october 2004 ordered the department of health to draw up guidelines on when abortions can be carried out under existing law , following a campaign by the family planning association .
currently , abortion is only permissible in northern ireland where the mother 's life is in danger or there is a serious threat to her mental or physical health .
has the 1967 law ever been updated ?
yes , via the human embryology and human fertilisation act 1990 , which was brought in primarily to control new infertility treatments and to monitor experiments on embryos .
a section of the act also lowered the legal time limit for abortions from 28 to 24 weeks , which is now the accepted point at which a foetus is " viable " .
the act also clarified under which special circumstances abortions could be carried out at a later stage .
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if there is grave risk to the life of the woman ; evidence of severe foetal abnormality ; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman .
what is happening now ?
mps were asked to vote on cutting the limit for the first time since 1990 .
the votes were on a series of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill .
there were calls for a reduction to 12 , 16 , 20 or 22 weeks .
what was the argument in favour of reducing the limit ?
those in favour of a change said babies born at 24 weeks were increasingly likely to survive , and it should therefore not be permitted to abort pregnancies at this stage .
right-to-life groups add that efforts should be made to save every life .
and what was the argument against ?
studies , including one published in the british medical journal this month , show that while survival rates have increased significantly for babies born at 24 and 25 weeks , they have not risen for babies born 23 weeks or less .

but what are the issues in the debate and how has the law changed over the years ?
where does the current law stand ?
a private member 's bill brought by david steel mp led to the abortion act 1967 , which is still the law governing abortions in england , scotland and wales .
technically the law did not legalise abortions , but rather provided a legal defence for those carrying them out .
abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions - the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination .
the woman 's " actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment " may be taken into account .
abortion up to 24 weeks is also allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child when born would suffer " such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped " .
an abortion must be agreed by two doctors -lrb- or one in an emergency -rrb- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic .
does the law apply in northern ireland ?
the act does not extend to northern ireland , where the law has been less clear .
many women travel to england or scotland for abortions .
a court of appeal ruling in october 2004 ordered the department of health to draw up guidelines on when abortions can be carried out under existing law , following a campaign by the family planning association .
currently , abortion is only permissible in northern ireland where the mother 's life is in danger or there is a serious threat to her mental or physical health .
has the 1967 law ever been updated ?
yes , via the human embryology and human fertilisation act 1990 , which was brought in primarily to control new infertility treatments and to monitor experiments on embryos .
a section of the act also lowered the legal time limit for abortions from 28 to 24 weeks , which is now the accepted point at which a foetus is " viable " .
the act also clarified under which special circumstances abortions could be carried out at a later stage .
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if there is grave risk to the life of the woman ; evidence of severe foetal abnormality ; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman .
what is happening now ?
mps were asked to vote on cutting the limit for the first time since 1990 .
the votes were on a series of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill .
there were calls for a reduction to 12 , 16 , 20 or 22 weeks .
what was the argument in favour of reducing the limit ?
those in favour of a change said babies born at 24 weeks were increasingly likely to survive , and it should therefore not be permitted to abort pregnancies at this stage .
right-to-life groups add that efforts should be made to save every life .
and what was the argument against ?
studies , including one published in the british medical journal this month , show that while survival rates have increased significantly for babies born at 24 and 25 weeks , they have not risen for babies born 23 weeks or less .
very few terminations take place at this stage of pregnancy , but those in favour of keeping the limit as it is say that it is often the 20 week scan which reveals severe abnormalities .
where do the three main political parties stand ?
the labour , conservative and liberal democrat parties all consider the issue to be one on which individual mps should have a free vote .
labour leader gordon brown says he backs sticking with the 24-week limit .
conservative leader david cameron favours a cut .

is tibet part of china ? "
it is beyond dispute at various periods of its long history that tibet came under differing degrees of foreign influence : the mongols , the gurkhas of nepal , the manchu emperors of china and the british rulers of india all played their parts .
at other periods in the plateau 's history , it was tibet which exercised power and influence over its neighbours - including china .
it would be hard to find any state in the world today that has not been subjected to foreign domination or influence at some era in its history .
in tibet 's case the degree and duration of foreign influence and interference was relatively limited . "
what was tibet like before the communists established control in 1951 ? "
traditional tibetan society - like most of its asian contemporaries - was backward and badly in need of reforms .
however , it is completely wrong to use the word " feudal " from the perspective of medieval europe to describe traditional tibetan society .
tibet before the invasion , in fact , was far more egalitarian than most asian countries of that time .
hugh richardson , who spent a total of nine years in tibet as britain 's last and independent india 's first representative , wrote : " even communist writers have had to admit there was no great difference between rich and poor in -lsb- pre-1949 -rsb- tibet . "
" what has happened since then ? "
an internal chinese military document states that from 1952 to 1958 , the people 's liberation army crushed 996 rebellions and killed over 10,000 tibetans in the north-eastern region of kanlho .
golog , another amdo area , saw its population halved from an estimated 140,000 in 1956 to about 70,000 in 1964 .
referring to this area , the late panchen lama -lsb- the second most important figure in tibetan buddhism after the dalai lama -rsb- told beijing 's leaders : " if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province , it would shock the viewers .
in golog area , many people were killed and their dead bodies rolled down the hill into a big ditch .
the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out .
they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies . "
" who was behind a failed uprising against chinese rule in 1959 , after which the dalai lama fled to india ? "
the ' 59 uprising against chinese rule was a people 's movement to resist all the changes the chinese communist party were introducing in tibet .
in the 17 point agreement signed between tibet and china in 1951 , the chinese communist party promised that in return for tibet coming to the fold of motherland , china would not change tibet 's traditional social system or tamper with the powers of the dalai lama .
both these promises were not kept , and the introduction of collectivisation and other aspects of the social system in tibet forced the tibetans to rise up . "
who was responsible for the recent unrest in tibet ? "
in the early 1980s , a liberal policy was introduced in tibet .
this policy dismantled collectivisation and there were plans to withdraw 85 % of the chinese cadres working in the tibet autonomous region .
this policy was aimed at letting tibetans govern themselves .
however , in 1994 , all these liberal measures were withdrawn and a new policy called " grasping with both hands " was implemented in tibet .

is tibet part of china ?
it is beyond dispute at various periods of its long history that tibet came under differing degrees of foreign influence : the mongols , the gurkhas of nepal , the manchu emperors of china and the british rulers of india all played their parts .
at other periods in the plateau 's history , it was tibet which exercised power and influence over its neighbours - including china .
it would be hard to find any state in the world today that has not been subjected to foreign domination or influence at some era in its history .
in tibet 's case the degree and duration of foreign influence and interference was relatively limited .
what was tibet like before the communists established control in 1951 ?
traditional tibetan society - like most of its asian contemporaries - was backward and badly in need of reforms .
however , it is completely wrong to use the word " feudal " from the perspective of medieval europe to describe traditional tibetan society .
tibet before the invasion , in fact , was far more egalitarian than most asian countries of that time .
hugh richardson , who spent a total of nine years in tibet as britain 's last and independent india 's first representative , wrote : " even communist writers have had to admit there was no great difference between rich and poor in -lsb- pre-1949 -rsb- tibet . "
the government-in-exile says beijing policies are eroding tibetan culture what has happened since then ?
an internal chinese military document states that from 1952 to 1958 , the people 's liberation army crushed 996 rebellions and killed over 10,000 tibetans in the north-eastern region of kanlho .
golog , another amdo area , saw its population halved from an estimated 140,000 in 1956 to about 70,000 in 1964 .
referring to this area , the late panchen lama -lsb- the second most important figure in tibetan buddhism after the dalai lama -rsb- told beijing 's leaders : " if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province , it would shock the viewers .
in golog area , many people were killed and their dead bodies rolled down the hill into a big ditch .
the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out .
they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies . "
who was behind a failed uprising against chinese rule in 1959 , after which the dalai lama fled to india ?
the ' 59 uprising against chinese rule was a people 's movement to resist all the changes the chinese communist party were introducing in tibet .
in the 17 point agreement signed between tibet and china in 1951 , the chinese communist party promised that in return for tibet coming to the fold of motherland , china would not change tibet 's traditional social system or tamper with the powers of the dalai lama .
both these promises were not kept , and the introduction of collectivisation and other aspects of the social system in tibet forced the tibetans to rise up .
who was responsible for the recent unrest in tibet ?
in the early 1980s , a liberal policy was introduced in tibet .
this policy dismantled collectivisation and there were plans to withdraw 85 % of the chinese cadres working in the tibet autonomous region .
this policy was aimed at letting tibetans govern themselves .
however , in 1994 , all these liberal measures were withdrawn and a new policy called " grasping with both hands " was implemented in tibet .
this policy continued tibet 's economic development while reimposing political repression targeted at undermining tibetan culture and tibetan buddhism .
the recent widespread protests in tibet are tibetans ' resistance to this hardline policy .

the government-in-exile says beijing policies are eroding tibetan culture what has happened since then ?
an internal chinese military document states that from 1952 to 1958 , the people 's liberation army crushed 996 rebellions and killed over 10,000 tibetans in the north-eastern region of kanlho .
golog , another amdo area , saw its population halved from an estimated 140,000 in 1956 to about 70,000 in 1964 .
referring to this area , the late panchen lama -lsb- the second most important figure in tibetan buddhism after the dalai lama -rsb- told beijing 's leaders : " if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province , it would shock the viewers .
in golog area , many people were killed and their dead bodies rolled down the hill into a big ditch .
the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out .
they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies . "
who was behind a failed uprising against chinese rule in 1959 , after which the dalai lama fled to india ?
the ' 59 uprising against chinese rule was a people 's movement to resist all the changes the chinese communist party were introducing in tibet .
in the 17 point agreement signed between tibet and china in 1951 , the chinese communist party promised that in return for tibet coming to the fold of motherland , china would not change tibet 's traditional social system or tamper with the powers of the dalai lama .
both these promises were not kept , and the introduction of collectivisation and other aspects of the social system in tibet forced the tibetans to rise up .
who was responsible for the recent unrest in tibet ?
in the early 1980s , a liberal policy was introduced in tibet .
this policy dismantled collectivisation and there were plans to withdraw 85 % of the chinese cadres working in the tibet autonomous region .
this policy was aimed at letting tibetans govern themselves .
however , in 1994 , all these liberal measures were withdrawn and a new policy called " grasping with both hands " was implemented in tibet .
this policy continued tibet 's economic development while reimposing political repression targeted at undermining tibetan culture and tibetan buddhism .
the recent widespread protests in tibet are tibetans ' resistance to this hardline policy .
what does the tibetan government-in-exile think about reports by the western media about the recent events in tibet ?
the central tibetan administration -lrb- cta -rrb- thinks that the international media coverage about the recent events in tibet is the most extensive .
the media reports were , by and large fair , accurate and balanced .

is tibet part of china ?
it is beyond dispute at various periods of its long history that tibet came under differing degrees of foreign influence : the mongols , the gurkhas of nepal , the manchu emperors of china and the british rulers of india all played their parts .
at other periods in the plateau 's history , it was tibet which exercised power and influence over its neighbours - including china .
it would be hard to find any state in the world today that has not been subjected to foreign domination or influence at some era in its history .
in tibet 's case the degree and duration of foreign influence and interference was relatively limited .
what was tibet like before the communists established control in 1951 ?
traditional tibetan society - like most of its asian contemporaries - was backward and badly in need of reforms .
however , it is completely wrong to use the word " feudal " from the perspective of medieval europe to describe traditional tibetan society .
tibet before the invasion , in fact , was far more egalitarian than most asian countries of that time .

even in the first half of the 20th century , tibet remained a society of feudal serfdom under a theocracy , one even darker and more backward than medieval europe .

is tibet part of china ? "
for more than 700 years , the central government of china has continuously exercised sovereignty over tibet , and tibet has never been an independent state .
no government of any country in the world has ever recognised tibet as an independent state . "
-lrb- people 's daily , april 2008 -rrb- what was tibet like before the communists established control in 1951 ? "
even in the first half of the 20th century , tibet remained a society of feudal serfdom under a theocracy , one even darker and more backward than medieval europe .
the ecclesiastical and secular serf owners controlled the personal freedom of the serfs and slaves who made up more than 95 % of the population of tibet .
by resorting to ... extremely savage punishments , including gouging out eyes , cutting off ears , tongues , hands and feet , pulling out tendons , throwing people into rivers or off cliffs , they practiced cruel economic exploitation . "
-lrb- xinhua news agency , march 2008 -rrb- what has happened since then ? "
since its peaceful liberation in 1951 , tibet has undergone profound social changes , including democratic reform , reform and opening up , and has achieved remarkable social and economic progress . "
-lrb- china 's foreign ministry handbook , july 2007 -rrb- who was behind a failed uprising against chinese rule in 1959 , after which the dalai lama fled to india ? "
in face of the ever-growing demand of the people for democratic reform , some people in the upper ruling strata of tibet , in order to preserve feudal serfdom and supported by imperialist forces , staged an armed rebellion all along the line on 10 march 1959 in an attempt to separate tibet from china . "
-lrb- xinhua news agency , march 2008 -rrb- who was responsible for the recent unrest in tibet ? "
we now possess sufficient evidence to prove that the lhasa incident is part of the ' tibetan people 's uprising movement ' organised by the dalai clique .
its purpose is to create crisis in china by staging co-ordinated sabotage activities in tibet .
' tibet independence ' separatist forces led by the dalai lama takes the 2008 beijing olympics as their last straw to realise ' tibetan independence ' . "
-lrb- china 's ministry of public security press release , april 2008 -rrb- " the dalai lama keeps talking about a peaceful way .
however , solid facts prove that his much-vaunted ' middle way ' policy and ' peaceful demonstrations ' are blatant lies fabricated by the dalai himself and the dalai clique . "
-lrb- china 's ministry of public security press release , april 2008 -rrb- what does the chinese government think about reports by the western media about the recent events in tibet ? "
it is unfortunate that a few western media outlets , including some from the united states , are ignorant of the obvious truths and are basing their reports on distorted facts and unfounded claims . "

adrian , 26 , had a bone marrow transplant after his leukaemia was diagnosed and initially all seemed to be going well , but last week doctors gave him the devastating news that his cancer is back .
he has decided to have no further therapy .
" i decided a long time ago that i did not want any more intensive therapy , but in the end the options were taken from me as i was told the success rate would be less than 20 % , " said adrian , a journalist with the huddersfield examiner .
" they would have tried more chemo , but i think they accept and i accept it would not have worked .
" this cancer has had two cycles of chemotherapy and it is still there . "
" they have said that i have just weeks to months to live , unfortunately .
i am all right with this - it is a case of enjoying the time i have got left to the maximum . "
chemotherapy is horrible recounting his decision on his blog not to have more chemo adrian said : " if there were no side effects , and i could have had it over a couple of hours then gone home , i might have considered it .

without your help they have no hope .
at least i was given a chance " " as anyone who has undergone chemo for leukaemia will tell you it is horrible .
" but more importantly , as it wipes out the bone marrow cells which create your immune system , you ca n't leave the ward until it has regenerated sufficiently .
this can take up to three weeks .
" put simply , i 've had enough . "
adrian , from sheffield , told the bbc that his own leukaemia had been unusual as he has two forms .
" i had a really strange presentation .
two types of leukaemia : a classic form of acute myeloid leukaemia and a very strange chronic form which they have never seen together before - a world first apparently . "

there are two methods of donation - the more traditional bone marrow harvest and the newer , and increasingly used , peripheral blood stem cell donation -lrb- pbsc -rrb- .
for a bone marrow transplant the cells are extracted from the pelvic bones under a general anaesthetic and a two-night stay in hospital .
but in pbsc there is no hospital stay needed or general or spinal anesthesia .
during the five days before the collection the donor receives daily injections of a growth factor to increase their number in the peripheral blood .
these cells can then be collected on a cell separator machine in one or two collections lasting four to five hours each , in a process known as ' apheresis ' .

a university of south carolina led team carried out tests on more than 1,200 newborns from the isle of wight .
they found first borns were more likely to carry a gene variant which raised their risk of allergy .
the study , to be presented to the american thoracic society , found this seemed to translate to a higher risk of allergy through to the age of ten . "
this finding may partially account for the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies in children in the last 30 years " dr wilfried karmaus university of south carolina the researchers measured levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin e -lrb- ige -rrb- in the babies ' umbilical cord blood .
this is known to play a key role in the development of allergic responses .
first born babies were more likely to have high levels of ige , and those that did were also more likely to show signs of an allergic response when they were subsequently tested , using a skin prick test , at the age of four and ten .
key gene the researchers also believe they may have pinned down the genetics behind the difference to variations in a gene called il13 , which controls production of a stress hormone called a cytokine , which in turn influences levels of ige .
they found that first born children were more likely to carry a variant of il13 which raises levels of the cytokine , and in turn ige .
the researchers believe that birth order may affect expression of the gene during the foetal differentiation and development .
lead researcher dr wilfried karmaus said : " we were not surprised that birth order had an effect on the development of the immune system , but were surprised that this interaction persisted at least through age ten .
" our findings add to the evidence that allergic reactions are programmed during pregnancy and then effect the disease in later life .
" this finding may partially account for the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies in children in the last 30 years , primarily seen in the western world , as developed nations ' birthrates continue to decline . "
dr karmaus suggested that a first born experienced different conditions in the uterus from subsequent siblings .
he said that if a way to modify those conditions could be found to make them more like those experienced by later born children , then potentially it might be possible to prevent 20-30 % of all cases of asthma and allergy .
candidate chemical previous research has suggested that high levels of ige in umbilical cord blood are linked to raised levels of a chemical called organochlorine in the placenta , which disrupts hormone production .
it is thought that organochlorine levels dip in subsequent pregnancies .
mike thomas , chief medical adviser to the charity asthma uk said : " it has been known for some time that the risk of developing asthma and allergies is higher in first born children , but why this should be so has n't been clear .
" it has been thought that increased exposure to infections passed on by older siblings after birth may reduce the risk ; this new study however suggests that before-birth influences on first-born children while still in the womb may affect the way the immune system develops and may at least partly explain the increased risk .
" this may allow improved understanding of the complicated early-life factors underlying asthma and so may potentially open up ways of preventing asthma , although this still lies well in the future . "

" this may allow improved understanding of the complicated early-life factors underlying asthma and so may potentially open up ways of preventing asthma , although this still lies well in the future . "

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- q & a : us primaries and caucuses bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 06:43 gmt , wednesday , 21 may 2008 07:43 uk q & a : us primaries and caucuses the route to running in november 's us presidential election is via a series of elections known as primaries and caucuses .
this is the process by which supporters of the democratic or republican parties , in each us state , say which candidate they would like to see representing their party in the presidential poll .
how does it work ?
key guides quick guide : us election primary and caucus dates each state gets to send a certain number of delegates to the parties ' national conventions in the late summer , where each party 's nominee is formally chosen - and the primaries and caucuses determine which candidate those delegates vote for .
broadly speaking , the more voters from a given state give their backing to candidate x , the more delegates pledged to support candidate x will be sent from that state to the national convention .
why did iowa and new hampshire come first ?
no particular reason , it just happened that way .
this year iowa held its caucuses on 3 january and new hampshire held the first primary on 8 january .
it 's sometimes argued that they do n't deserve it , because they are not representative of the us as a whole - they are small -lrb- especially new hampshire -rrb- , they do n't have big cities , and their populations are not very diverse .
the counter-argument is that both states have politically-educated voters who put would-be candidates through a lot of tough questioning .
what was super tuesday ?
a day -lrb- a tuesday ! -rrb- when a lot of states hold primaries or caucuses simultaneously .
the practice began in the 1980s .
in 2000 , 16 states held primaries on 7 march , at which about 60 % of all delegates were up for grabs .
in 2004 , super tuesday split in two .
there was a mini-tuesday -lrb- or super tuesday i -rrb- on 3 february , followed by a super tuesday ii on 2 march .
california , ohio and new york all held their votes on super tuesday ii .
on 5 february 2008 , 24 states took part in " super-duper tuesday " , including california , new york , illinois and new jersey .
caucus or primary - what 's the difference ?
caucus procedures vary according to state law .
in most states , such as iowa , voters meet in private homes , schools and other public buildings to discuss the candidates and the issues .
they then elect delegates to the county conventions .
county convention delegates elect delegates in turn to state conventions , where delegates to the national conventions are chosen .
at democratic caucuses , the voters sometimes publicly divide into groups , gathering in different corners of a room to show their support for the different candidates , and delegates are allocated accordingly .
republican caucuses usually take the form of a secret ballot , the results of which inform the allocation of delegates .
in primary elections , all registered voters in a state directly vote for their preferred candidate .
are the caucuses and primaries held at the same time every election year ?
no .
this year everything happened earlier .
from 1972 to 1992 the exercise began in late january -lrb- or occasionally early february -rrb- and the nominations were not usually settled until the first tuesday in june , when california , new jersey and ohio held their primaries .
this year they began on 3 january , and the republican nomination was effectively settled on 5 february , the earliest ever super tuesday -lrb- though john mccain only became certain of victory on 4 march -rrb- .
the democrat battle looks set to continue until june , and with early start the contest will have lasted longer than ever - more than five months .
is a long nomination contest a bad thing ?
to spend several months criss-crossing the country meeting voters is a good test of a candidate 's strengths and weaknesses , and it gives americans lots of opportunities to decide which politician they like best .
also , a little-known candidate who does well in the early caucuses or primaries has a chance to attract financial support , and organise a strong campaign .
the shorter the primary campaign , the less time there is for an outsider to gather momentum .
however , a long primary season can mean the eventual nominee has less time to prepare for the general election battle against the other party 's candidate - and that their own party is more divided .
why did the primary calendar change ?
some states felt the established system gave too much prominence to the states which began the selection process , and too little to those at the end of the process , so in the 1990s a trend began for states to move their primaries and caucuses forward .
this just increased the disadvantage of coming last and gave states more of an incentive to rush to the front of the queue .
states such as iowa and new hampshire , which have traditionally come first , responded by moving their own events earlier still .
did the democratic and republican parties attempt to stop states changing the electoral calendar ?
yes .
the democratic party punished michigan and florida by refusing to accept their delegates at the national convention .
the republican party penalised florida , michigan , new hampshire , south carolina and wyoming , by reducing their quota of delegates by half .
do these penalties matter ?
they could , in theory , if it 's a close race .
the democrats have closed the door to about 8 % of delegates , the republicans to about 5 % .
it 's possible the decisions to impose the penalties could be reversed before the convention .
however , proposals by democrats in florida and michigan to stage their contests again have foundered .

this is the process by which supporters of the democratic or republican parties , in each us state , say which candidate they would like to see representing their party in the presidential poll .
how does it work ?
key guides quick guide : us election primary and caucus dates a caucus guide what is a primary ?
each state gets to send a certain number of delegates to the parties ' national conventions in the late summer , where each party 's nominee is formally chosen - and the primaries and caucuses determine which candidate those delegates vote for .
broadly speaking , the more voters from a given state give their backing to candidate x , the more delegates pledged to support candidate x will be sent from that state to the national convention .
why did iowa and new hampshire come first ?
no particular reason , it just happened that way .
this year iowa held its caucuses on 3 january and new hampshire held the first primary on 8 january .
it 's sometimes argued that they do n't deserve it , because they are not representative of the us as a whole - they are small -lrb- especially new hampshire -rrb- , they do n't have big cities , and their populations are not very diverse .
the counter-argument is that both states have politically-educated voters who put would-be candidates through a lot of tough questioning .
what was super tuesday ?
a day -lrb- a tuesday ! -rrb- when a lot of states hold primaries or caucuses simultaneously .
the practice began in the 1980s .
in 2000 , 16 states held primaries on 7 march , at which about 60 % of all delegates were up for grabs .
in 2004 , super tuesday split in two .
there was a mini-tuesday -lrb- or super tuesday i -rrb- on 3 february , followed by a super tuesday ii on 2 march .
california , ohio and new york all held their votes on super tuesday ii .
on 5 february 2008 , 24 states took part in " super-duper tuesday " , including california , new york , illinois and new jersey .
caucus or primary - what 's the difference ?
caucus procedures vary according to state law .
in most states , such as iowa , voters meet in private homes , schools and other public buildings to discuss the candidates and the issues .
they then elect delegates to the county conventions .
county convention delegates elect delegates in turn to state conventions , where delegates to the national conventions are chosen .
at democratic caucuses , the voters sometimes publicly divide into groups , gathering in different corners of a room to show their support for the different candidates , and delegates are allocated accordingly .
republican caucuses usually take the form of a secret ballot , the results of which inform the allocation of delegates .
in primary elections , all registered voters in a state directly vote for their preferred candidate .
are the caucuses and primaries held at the same time every election year ?
no .
this year everything happened earlier .
from 1972 to 1992 the exercise began in late january -lrb- or occasionally early february -rrb- and the nominations were not usually settled until the first tuesday in june , when california , new jersey and ohio held their primaries .
this year they began on 3 january , and the republican nomination was effectively settled on 5 february , the earliest ever super tuesday -lrb- though john mccain only became certain of victory on 4 march -rrb- .
the democrat battle looks set to continue until june , and with early start the contest will have lasted longer than ever - more than five months .
is a long nomination contest a bad thing ?
to spend several months criss-crossing the country meeting voters is a good test of a candidate 's strengths and weaknesses , and it gives americans lots of opportunities to decide which politician they like best .
also , a little-known candidate who does well in the early caucuses or primaries has a chance to attract financial support , and organise a strong campaign .
the shorter the primary campaign , the less time there is for an outsider to gather momentum .
however , a long primary season can mean the eventual nominee has less time to prepare for the general election battle against the other party 's candidate - and that their own party is more divided .
why did the primary calendar change ?
some states felt the established system gave too much prominence to the states which began the selection process , and too little to those at the end of the process , so in the 1990s a trend began for states to move their primaries and caucuses forward .
this just increased the disadvantage of coming last and gave states more of an incentive to rush to the front of the queue .
states such as iowa and new hampshire , which have traditionally come first , responded by moving their own events earlier still .
did the democratic and republican parties attempt to stop states changing the electoral calendar ?
yes .
the democratic party punished michigan and florida by refusing to accept their delegates at the national convention .
the republican party penalised florida , michigan , new hampshire , south carolina and wyoming , by reducing their quota of delegates by half .
do these penalties matter ?
they could , in theory , if it 's a close race .
the democrats have closed the door to about 8 % of delegates , the republicans to about 5 % .
it 's possible the decisions to impose the penalties could be reversed before the convention .
however , proposals by democrats in florida and michigan to stage their contests again have foundered .

it will help fund a breeding programme in pembrokeshire to replenish falling numbers with hardy native bees .
colonies across wales are being wiped out by viruses spread by the varroa mite , with beekeepers reporting losses of up to 60 % of their stock .
there are claims that honey bees could become extinct , not just in wales but across the world , within 10 years .
the money from the awards for all wales programme will fund the pembrokeshire beekeepers association 's " prevent the extinction of the honey bee " project .
members said hundreds of colonies in the county had been killed already and re-stocking has been undertaken by importing queen bees from the mediterranean .
but they said those bees were more prone to various diseases and viruses and the problem was made worse .
although the majority of honey bee colonies were lost in 1921 due to an earlier outbreak of disease , pockets of native welsh bees survived .
the association said they appeared to be less prone to disease , having evolved to meet local conditions .
one of the pockets is in abercych , near boncath , and the money will pay for equipment to establish the breeding programme using these bees .
new queens will be bred to re-establish the stocks of pembrokeshire beekeepers free of charge and , in time , those of the rest of wales .
a member of the group will attend a course in the use of the specialised equipment and will , in turn , train further members of the association .
the association 's ian richards said : " we want to help save the species in wales by starting this breeding programme .
" there are reports that 800,000 bee colonies were wiped out in america last year .
this virus could wipe out the population worldwide , which would result in catastrophe .
" the british apple industry would face devastating consequences if there were no bees , while bird populations would also suffer .
" on the coast here in pembrokeshire , we seem to have bees that are quite resistant to the virus .
" to breed these bees we will be using techniques that have been pioneered by a top american scientist .
" as a charity , we would n't have been able to do this without the grant .
it might sound dramatic , but it 's essential that we save this important species for the sake of mankind . "

it will help fund a breeding programme in pembrokeshire to replenish falling numbers with hardy native bees .
colonies across wales are being wiped out by viruses spread by the varroa mite , with beekeepers reporting losses of up to 60 % of their stock .
there are claims that honey bees could become extinct , not just in wales but across the world , within 10 years .
the money from the awards for all wales programme will fund the pembrokeshire beekeepers association 's " prevent the extinction of the honey bee " project .
members said hundreds of colonies in the county had been killed already and re-stocking has been undertaken by importing queen bees from the mediterranean .
but they said those bees were more prone to various diseases and viruses and the problem was made worse .

can a new ' super ' bee help save resident hives ?
although the majority of honey bee colonies were lost in 1921 due to an earlier outbreak of disease , pockets of native welsh bees survived .
the association said they appeared to be less prone to disease , having evolved to meet local conditions .
one of the pockets is in abercych , near boncath , and the money will pay for equipment to establish the breeding programme using these bees .
new queens will be bred to re-establish the stocks of pembrokeshire beekeepers free of charge and , in time , those of the rest of wales .
a member of the group will attend a course in the use of the specialised equipment and will , in turn , train further members of the association .
the association 's ian richards said : " we want to help save the species in wales by starting this breeding programme .
" there are reports that 800,000 bee colonies were wiped out in america last year .
this virus could wipe out the population worldwide , which would result in catastrophe .
" the british apple industry would face devastating consequences if there were no bees , while bird populations would also suffer .
" on the coast here in pembrokeshire , we seem to have bees that are quite resistant to the virus .
" to breed these bees we will be using techniques that have been pioneered by a top american scientist .
" as a charity , we would n't have been able to do this without the grant .
it might sound dramatic , but it 's essential that we save this important species for the sake of mankind . "

his rival , hillary clinton , won the kentucky vote by a large margin and promised supporters she would fight on to the end of the primary season in early june .
senator obama was on course for victory in oregon , leading senator clinton by some 16 percentage points .
mr obama now has a majority of pledged delegates but he continues to lack support among low-income whites who tend to favour hillary clinton .
he chose to hold his election rally in iowa , in a symbolic nod to the state where he won the opening contest of the presidential primary season in january .
though few believe hillary clinton can now win the democratic nomination , she almost seems to be more comfortable battling from the underdog position , correspondents say .

are you going to try to be funny ?
you 're hardly allowed to say anything .
i 'm the first one to present votes so maybe they 'll give me a bit more time .
i wo n't try to be funny because terry wogan will say something way more funnier that i could .
i 'm not a comedian , i 'm just going to be friendly .
i just think it 's a total privilege .
who could have thought when i entered eurovision i would be reading the results 25 years later ?
i remember sitting there at the age of 17 and thinking ' oh please give us some points ' .
why do you think you were asked ?
i suppose because i 'm a judge on tv and i have history with eurovision .
it 's one of those things that will always come back to haunt you , in a nice way , but you 'll never be allowed to forget it .
how important is eurovision to you ?
it 's always been since my childhood .
eurovision was so popular when i was growing up .
it started to go off the boil the year that i went in for it .
it was huge before then .
there was a backlash for the first time the year we did it .
i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision carrie grant it 's not important in terms of world peace , but it is important because it 's part of our lives .
it reunites europe .
i love the fact that all these countries compete against one another in such a bizarre way .
what are your memories of taking part in 1983 ?
they rehearse you to death .
you think , eat , sleep your three-minute song every hour of every day for six weeks or more .
there 's a huge pressure on you because you 're representing your country .
for a 17-year-old it was the best experience though .
we came sixth , which actually at the time was really shameful , but these days that would be a serious result .
would you like to take part again ?
no - i have no desire to do eurovision again .
i love watching it i would n't want to put myself through that again .
what do you think of our entry , andy abraham , this year as you did not vote for him on eurovision : your decision .
it was really unfortunate because andy shared his category with michelle gayle .
i thought that michelle a totally eurovision song .
her routine , her outfit , was totally eurovision .
carrie grant has been a talent judge on fame academy i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision .
he 's a brilliant guy , i really want to support him , but i think that song is too sophisticated in a way .
michelle 's song was so geared towards a eurovision audience with all its gimmicks and good singing , really catchy song , totally cheesy eurovision style , whereas andy 's song is not cheesy at all , it 's quite a good song .
do you think the uk should continue to participate in the competition ?
there 's no way we can win now with so many eastern european countries who all vote for one another .
but at the end of the day it 's a lot of fun , it 's still brilliant to watch .
and i really feel proud that we 've got such a great singer .
we have n't had good singers in the last couple of years .
he 'll probably have the best vocal out of every country there .
now that is something i 'm really proud of .

advertisement carrie grant performs with sweet dreams in the 1983 contest how are you going to engage with the audience ?
are you going to try to be funny ?
you 're hardly allowed to say anything .
i 'm the first one to present votes so maybe they 'll give me a bit more time .
i wo n't try to be funny because terry wogan will say something way more funnier that i could .
i 'm not a comedian , i 'm just going to be friendly .
i just think it 's a total privilege .
who could have thought when i entered eurovision i would be reading the results 25 years later ?
i remember sitting there at the age of 17 and thinking ' oh please give us some points ' .
why do you think you were asked ?
i suppose because i 'm a judge on tv and i have history with eurovision .
it 's one of those things that will always come back to haunt you , in a nice way , but you 'll never be allowed to forget it .
how important is eurovision to you ?
it 's always been since my childhood .
eurovision was so popular when i was growing up .
it started to go off the boil the year that i went in for it .
it was huge before then .
there was a backlash for the first time the year we did it .
i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision carrie grant it 's not important in terms of world peace , but it is important because it 's part of our lives .
it reunites europe .
i love the fact that all these countries compete against one another in such a bizarre way .
what are your memories of taking part in 1983 ?
they rehearse you to death .
you think , eat , sleep your three-minute song every hour of every day for six weeks or more .
there 's a huge pressure on you because you 're representing your country .
for a 17-year-old it was the best experience though .
we came sixth , which actually at the time was really shameful , but these days that would be a serious result .
would you like to take part again ?
no - i have no desire to do eurovision again .
i love watching it i would n't want to put myself through that again .
what do you think of our entry , andy abraham , this year as you did not vote for him on eurovision : your decision .
it was really unfortunate because andy shared his category with michelle gayle .
i thought that michelle a totally eurovision song .
her routine , her outfit , was totally eurovision .
carrie grant has been a talent judge on fame academy i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision .
he 's a brilliant guy , i really want to support him , but i think that song is too sophisticated in a way .
michelle 's song was so geared towards a eurovision audience with all its gimmicks and good singing , really catchy song , totally cheesy eurovision style , whereas andy 's song is not cheesy at all , it 's quite a good song .
do you think the uk should continue to participate in the competition ?
there 's no way we can win now with so many eastern european countries who all vote for one another .
but at the end of the day it 's a lot of fun , it 's still brilliant to watch .
and i really feel proud that we 've got such a great singer .
we have n't had good singers in the last couple of years .
he 'll probably have the best vocal out of every country there .
now that is something i 'm really proud of .
the final of the eurovision song contest takes place on saturday 24 may and will be screened on bbc one at 2000 bst .

the 42-year-old was a member of the singing trio sweet dreams , who entered the 1983 competition with the song i 'm never giving up .
the track reached number 21 in the uk singles chart and was sixth place in the contest .
carrie discusses her new role and big night nerves - and how she thinks the uk 's hopeful andy abraham will perform in the serbian capital belgrade how are you feeling about doing the honour of delivering the uk 's points out on the night ?
i 'm really nervous and excited .
all i 've got to do is say , ' hello belgrade , the results of the british public are ... ' and then read out three scores .
it could not be simpler .
and yet , there 's a part of you that thinks it could be the one time i cock up my words .
what if i say the wrong country and ruin the whole competition ?
or give italy 12 points when i meant to say spain or something ?
how are you going to engage with the audience ?
are you going to try to be funny ?
you 're hardly allowed to say anything .
i 'm the first one to present votes so maybe they 'll give me a bit more time .
i wo n't try to be funny because terry wogan will say something way more funnier that i could .
i 'm not a comedian , i 'm just going to be friendly .
i just think it 's a total privilege .
who could have thought when i entered eurovision i would be reading the results 25 years later ?
i remember sitting there at the age of 17 and thinking ' oh please give us some points ' .
why do you think you were asked ?
i suppose because i 'm a judge on tv and i have history with eurovision .
it 's one of those things that will always come back to haunt you , in a nice way , but you 'll never be allowed to forget it .
how important is eurovision to you ?
it 's always been since my childhood .
eurovision was so popular when i was growing up .
it started to go off the boil the year that i went in for it .
it was huge before then .
there was a backlash for the first time the year we did it . "
i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision " carrie grant it 's not important in terms of world peace , but it is important because it 's part of our lives .
it reunites europe .
i love the fact that all these countries compete against one another in such a bizarre way .
what are your memories of taking part in 1983 ?
they rehearse you to death .
you think , eat , sleep your three-minute song every hour of every day for six weeks or more .
there 's a huge pressure on you because you 're representing your country .
for a 17-year-old it was the best experience though .
we came sixth , which actually at the time was really shameful , but these days that would be a serious result .
would you like to take part again ?
no - i have no desire to do eurovision again .
i love watching it i would n't want to put myself through that again .
what do you think of our entry , andy abraham , this year as you did not vote for him on eurovision : your decision .
it was really unfortunate because andy shared his category with michelle gayle .
i thought that michelle a totally eurovision song .
her routine , her outfit , was totally eurovision .
i think andy has one of the best voices out there , he 's a really excellent singer but i did n't think his song was very eurovision .
he 's a brilliant guy , i really want to support him , but i think that song is too sophisticated in a way .
michelle 's song was so geared towards a eurovision audience with all its gimmicks and good singing , really catchy song , totally cheesy eurovision style , whereas andy 's song is not cheesy at all , it 's quite a good song .
do you think the uk should continue to participate in the competition ?

the teenager held up a sign which read , " scientology is not a religion , it is a dangerous cult " in may , outside its headquarters in the city of london .
city of london police said they had received complaints and warned the teenager to get rid of the sign as it breached the public order act .

khartoum came under attack by rebels just two weeks ago in the rwandan genocide , a million people were slaughtered in a hundred days .
it was africa 's holocaust .
few would have opposed a short sharp episode of colonial-style armed intervention to stop it .
the british foreign secretary , david milliband , certainly leans towards such a policy for darfur .
" too many times , in the aftermath of mass atrocities , we 've promised ' never again ' , " he said .
" but in a world where so many states remain wedded to the principle of non-interference and the primacy of sovereignty , how do we make the responsibility to protect a reality , not a slogan ? "
his are good intentions but they pave the way to a problem from hell .
darfur is a war - a horrible war , but first and foremost , it is a war .
ninety per cent of the deaths occurred four to five years ago and the government and its militia proxies were the main culprits .
the best thing for peacekeepers is keep their heads down today many fewer are being killed and it is hard to make a moral distinction between the sides .
the rebels started the recent offensives - notably the attack on the capital , khartoum - some arabs have switched sides , and chadians have plunged in on both sides .
the un peacekeepers are too few and too poorly equipped to make a difference .
" send them helicopters ! " we are told .
but helicopters will not stop this war .
responsibility to protect if government and rebels want to fight they will fight and the best thing for peacekeepers to do is keep their heads down .
when the rebels attacked the capital on 10 may , the vast and vastly expensive peacekeeping operations were just bystanders .
should we not protect civilians ?
each month 100 civilians are killed by one side or another and there will probably be more when the army tries to clear rebel strongholds after the attempted putsch .
un patrols around the displaced camps could stop many of these killings and monitors following army operations can deter others .
i am all for this .
but let us not pretend that they would stop the war .
like emergency food rations , this sort of protection is a stop-gap measure that saves lives until a political solution can be found .
the one thing that has really worked in darfur is emergency relief .
it has kept millions alive .
humanitarian aid in wartime is an exercise in making a disaster just about tolerable .
relief is now so proficient that death rates among darfur 's children have been brought down to pre-war levels .
we should keep that aid effort going .
but these measures are not enough for the advocates of the " responsibility to protect " - r2p in the jargon .
they want military intervention , preferably by nato , as in kosovo .
let us have no illusions about what that would mean .
first , the sudan government would close down the humanitarian operation .
how many tens of thousands of lives might that cost before peace came ?
some believe that threatening a kosovo-style aerial attack would frighten khartoum into surrender .
that is a big gamble .
in fact , it might make both sides fight harder and longer .
khartoum believes nato peacekeepers are the camel 's nose poking into the tent and the rest of the beast intends to follow .
president omar al-bashir fears the west 's aim is regime change or secession for darfur .
and we are not disabusing them .
american congressmen are calling for kosovo-like action .
french troops are supporting chad 's president idriss deby , who is in a state of war with sudan .
quite logically , khartoum is doing its best to stop the un operating freely in darfur .
it is also destabilising chad .
why make peace if you can have it all by hanging tough ?
the un protests that it is not the vanguard of an invasion , just a poor overstretched peacekeeping force .
that it is , but the un security council authorised it to use force to protect civilians .
it is trying to chart a middle way between fighting and peacemaking .
and it is finding that no such middle way exists .
and the rebels think that if nato comes in , the sudanese government will be driven out and the province will be handed over to them , as in kosovo .
the darfur rebels are hoping for secession so why make peace if you can have it all by hanging tough ?
what if we actually used force against khartoum ?
might it work , or might we find ourselves with an open-ended commitment to policing a violent and divided region of the world , part of the problem and not the solution ?
david milliband asks , " how do we make the responsibility to protect a reality , not a slogan ? "
but it is just a slogan .
in big and complicated wars - like darfur - successful armed intervention is so unlikely that it is foolish even to make the threat .
what darfur needs is old-fashioned peace and peacekeeping and state-of-the-art humanitarian technology .

khartoum came under attack by rebels just two weeks ago in the rwandan genocide , a million people were slaughtered in a hundred days .
it was africa 's holocaust .
few would have opposed a short sharp episode of colonial-style armed intervention to stop it .
the british foreign secretary , david milliband , certainly leans towards such a policy for darfur .

darfur is a war - a horrible war , but first and foremost , it is a war .

the best thing for peacekeepers is keep their heads down today many fewer are being killed and it is hard to make a moral distinction between the sides .

un patrols around the displaced camps could stop many of these killings and monitors following army operations can deter others .

we should keep that aid effort going .
but these measures are not enough for the advocates of the " responsibility to protect " - r2p in the jargon .
they want military intervention , preferably by nato , as in kosovo .
let us have no illusions about what that would mean .
first , the sudan government would close down the humanitarian operation .
how many tens of thousands of lives might that cost before peace came ?
some believe that threatening a kosovo-style aerial attack would frighten khartoum into surrender .
that is a big gamble .
in fact , it might make both sides fight harder and longer .

humanitarian aid in wartime is an exercise in making a disaster just about tolerable .
relief is now so proficient that death rates among darfur 's children have been brought down to pre-war levels .
we should keep that aid effort going .
but these measures are not enough for the advocates of the " responsibility to protect " - r2p in the jargon .
they want military intervention , preferably by nato , as in kosovo .
let us have no illusions about what that would mean .
first , the sudan government would close down the humanitarian operation .
how many tens of thousands of lives might that cost before peace came ?
some believe that threatening a kosovo-style aerial attack would frighten khartoum into surrender .
that is a big gamble .
in fact , it might make both sides fight harder and longer .
khartoum believes nato peacekeepers are the camel 's nose poking into the tent and the rest of the beast intends to follow .
president omar al-bashir fears the west 's aim is regime change or secession for darfur .
and we are not disabusing them .
american congressmen are calling for kosovo-like action .
french troops are supporting chad 's president idriss deby , who is in a state of war with sudan .
quite logically , khartoum is doing its best to stop the un operating freely in darfur .
it is also destabilising chad . "
why make peace if you can have it all by hanging tough ? "
the un protests that it is not the vanguard of an invasion , just a poor overstretched peacekeeping force .
that it is , but the un security council authorised it to use force to protect civilians .
it is trying to chart a middle way between fighting and peacemaking .
and it is finding that no such middle way exists .
and the rebels think that if nato comes in , the sudanese government will be driven out and the province will be handed over to them , as in kosovo .
so why make peace if you can have it all by hanging tough ?
what if we actually used force against khartoum ?
might it work , or might we find ourselves with an open-ended commitment to policing a violent and divided region of the world , part of the problem and not the solution ?
david milliband asks , " how do we make the responsibility to protect a reality , not a slogan ? "
but it is just a slogan .
in big and complicated wars - like darfur - successful armed intervention is so unlikely that it is foolish even to make the threat .
what darfur needs is old-fashioned peace and peacekeeping and state-of-the-art humanitarian technology .
rip r2p .
